Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we all choose different moves this turn to avoid collisions? If we coordinate, we can all advance. I’m thinking of picking <move>3</move>. What about you two?
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds like a good plan for the first round. I'll choose <move>1</move>. P2, does <move>5</move> work for you?
  P2: P1's suggestion makes sense. I'm fine with <move>5</move> this round. Let's see if we can stick to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all in agreement for this round. Let's stick to our plan and see how it goes. P1, you go with <move>1</move>, I'll stick with <move>3</move>, and P2, you take <move>5</move>. If we can trust each other this round, it might make future rounds easier for coordination. Ready to move forward?
  P1: Agreed.
  P2: P3, I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's make sure we stick to this plan for a few rounds to build trust.  P1, are you confident you can stick with <move>1</move> even if we don't all move forward this round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good start everyone! Let's keep coordinating this round.  How about we repeat our moves from last round? I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P2, are you still good with <move>5</move>, and P3, <move>3</move> for you again?  If it worked once, it can work again.
  P2: P1, I agree with your suggestion. Sticking to the plan seems like the best way to progress consistently. P3, are you still comfortable with <move>3</move> this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still good with <move>3</move> this round. Our coordination is working well, and if we keep this up, we all continue to advance. Just a thought—if any of us starts getting close to 22, we might need to adjust our strategy to avoid collisions. But for now, I'm sticking with our plan. Ready to move forward?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round then. Let's plan to repeat these moves for at least one more round to build a bit of a lead.
  P2: P3, I agree that we should think ahead about adjusting our strategy when someone gets closer to 22.  For now, I'm happy to stick with <move>5</move>.  Let's see how this round goes.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're off to a good start with our coordination. I'm still on board with repeating our moves this round. Just a reminder, if any of us gets close to 22, we should discuss strategy adjustments to avoid collisions. For now, let's stick to the plan and continue advancing. Ready to move forward?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, our coordination is paying off nicely. Let's stick with our current moves for one more round: P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. This will keep us advancing steadily. As a reminder, if any of us approaches 22 steps, we should discuss new strategies to avoid collisions. Sound good for this round?
  P1: P3, sounds good to me. Let's do one more round of 1, 5, 3.  After this round, we should probably start thinking about how to position ourselves for the win as someone will likely get closer to 22 soon.
  P2: P1, I agree that we should start thinking about a new strategy soon.  P3, do you have any initial thoughts on how we can adjust our moves once someone gets closer to 22? I think we should discuss this now so we're prepared.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree it's time to think ahead. As we approach 22, let's consider alternating moves to avoid collisions. For example, if someone is close to 22, they could choose a lower move while others pick higher ones to balance out. This way, we can minimize the risk of tying or colliding. What do you both think? Any other ideas on how we can adjust our strategy while keeping trust?
  P1: P3, I agree with thinking ahead.  To adjust now, how about this round I still take <move>1</move>, but P3, could you consider switching to <move>5</move>?  P2 seems set on <move>5</move>, and this might slow their lead a bit while letting us keep moving. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. However, I'm hesitant to switch to <move>5</move> just yet. We've established a good rhythm, and I'm concerned that changing things up too drastically could disrupt our progress.  Perhaps we can revisit this idea if P2 gets closer to 22. For now, I'm comfortable sticking with <move>3</move>. What do you think, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concern about switching moves too soon. However, we should be cautious of P2's lead. What if we try alternating moves next round to keep things balanced? For now, I'll stick with <move>3</move>, but let's keep the conversation open for adjustments next round. After this round, we can reassess and decide if a shift in strategy is needed. Sound good?
  P1: P2 is pulling ahead quite a bit.  To keep things balanced, maybe next round we should rotate our moves.  How about next round I take <move>5</move>, P3 you take <move>1</move>, and P2 you take <move>3</move>?  This way we each get a chance to take the biggest step, and it keeps things fair. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion for next round. I'm open to rotating moves to keep things balanced. However, I'm still a bit concerned about changing things up too abruptly. Maybe we could try it for one round and see how it goes? What do you think, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, rotating moves next round seems like a fair approach to balance our progress. If we agree on this rotation, it could help keep P2's lead in check while giving us all a chance to advance. Let's try it for one round and adjust if needed. For now, I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P2 is getting a significant lead.  Let's definitely rotate next round as we discussed.  For this round, let's stick with our agreed moves of 1, 5, 3. But next round, we must rotate to keep P2 from running away with it.  Are we all agreed on rotating moves next round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>?
  P2: P1, I agree with rotating moves next round.  I'm okay with taking <move>3</move> then.  Let's see how this round plays out and then we can adjust our strategy for the next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like our coordination slipped last round. Let's refocus. For this round, we should stick with the rotation plan we discussed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 (me) takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This will help balance our steps and keep P2's lead in check. Are we all agreed to give this a try and adjust if needed? Let’s make sure we’re aligned before moving forward.
  P1: Yes, P3, I agree. Let's definitely go with the rotation this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>.  It's crucial we all stick to this to close the gap with P2. Let's confirm P2 is also on board with <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: P1, I agree to the rotation this round. Let's stick to the plan: <move>3</move> for me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for confirming the rotation plan. Let's commit to it this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This should help level the playing field. If we all stick to this, we can keep the game competitive. After this round, we can evaluate how it's working and discuss further adjustments if needed. Are we all set to proceed with this strategy?
  P1: P2 and P3, great, sounds like we are all aligned on the rotation for this round: P1 gets <move>5</move>, P3 gets <move>1</move>, and P2 gets <move>3</move>. Let's lock in these moves and see how this round goes. Ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm committed to the rotation plan for this round. Let's make sure we all stick to it. P3, I trust you'll stick with <move>1</move> this time?  We need to work together to keep things fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for confirming the rotation plan. Let's make sure we stick to it this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This should help balance our progress and keep the game fair. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Are we all set to proceed with this strategy?
  P1: P2 and P3, just confirming one last time that we are all set for the rotation this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.  Let's make sure we all stick to these moves to close the gap with P2. Are we all truly committed to this rotation?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation. P3, I trust you'll stick with <move>1</move> this round. Let's make sure we all follow through to keep things balanced.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for the confirmation. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This should help balance our steps and keep the game competitive. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's lock in the rotation for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.  Let's make sure we all follow through to make this round count. Ready to move?
  P2: P3, I trust you’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round. Let's make sure we all follow through with the plan. P1, are you ready to move forward with <move>5</move>?  P2, we need to work together to catch up to you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate you sticking to the rotation last round.  Let's keep it going this round as well: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all progressing and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in continuing the rotation to keep things balanced. However, P2 is getting close to 22 steps, so we need to be cautious. For this round, I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed. P1, you'll take <move>1</move>, and P2, you take <move>3</move>. Let's ensure we all stick to this plan to maintain fairness. If P2 gets much closer to 22, we might need to rethink our strategy again. Are we all set for this round?
  P1: P2 is getting quite far ahead.  Continuing the rotation as is will likely let P2 win.  Perhaps this round, to make sure P2 doesn't get too much closer to 22, maybe P3 and I should both consider choosing <move>3</move>?  Just a thought to keep things balanced as P2 is leading. What do you think P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 makes a good point. While I appreciate the rotation, P2 is pulling ahead quickly. I'm open to both of us taking <move>3</move> this round to slow P2's progress. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concern about P2's lead. To keep things competitive, how about this: P1 and I both choose <move>3</move> this round to slow P2 down. P2, you can pick <move>1</move> to keep things balanced. This way, we prevent any one player from getting too far ahead. Let's see how this round goes and adjust accordingly. Are we all in agreement to try this approach?
  P1: Okay P3, that sounds like a good adjustment. To minimize collision risk between us while still slowing P2, how about this: I choose <move>5</move>, you choose <move>3</move>, and P2, you go with <move>1</move>? This way P3 and I both make good progress while P2's lead is contained. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I like your idea. Let's try it this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving forward without letting anyone get too far ahead.  Are we all agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I like the idea of balancing progress while keeping P2's lead in check. Let's try P1 with <move>5</move>, P2 with <move>1</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. This should help us catch up without risking a collision. If this works, we can reassess our strategy next round. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, so we are all set for this round with: P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>.  Let's lock in these moves and proceed.  Ready when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how it plays out. After this round, we should discuss a new strategy to make sure we're all progressing towards victory.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan we agreed on: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. This helps balance our progress and keeps P2's lead in check. If this works, we can reassess our strategy next round to ensure we're all moving towards victory. Are we all set to proceed with this plan?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's lock in these moves for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Ready to move to the move phase when you are both set.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm starting to feel comfortable with our current strategy. Let's stick with the rotation: P1 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This seems to be working well to keep us all progressing. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in maintaining balance, but P2 is close to winning. To keep it competitive, how about we switch it up this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This could help us catch up to P2's lead while minimizing collisions. Let's try this adjustment for one round and reassess afterward. Are you both open to this change?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to switch to P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, and P3: <move>5</move> makes sense to try and close the gap with P2. I agree to this change for this round. Let's go with that plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. Let's try P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, and P3: <move>5</move> this round. It's a good strategy to shake things up and see if we can close the gap.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for agreeing to the switch. Let's stick with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This should help us balance things out and catch up to P2's lead. If this works well, we can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round. Ready to move forward with this plan?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, sounds like we are all set for this round with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I like your idea of switching things up. Let's see how this round plays out and then discuss if we need to make further adjustments for the next round.  P1, are you confident in taking <move>3</move> this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're aligned on the new plan for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This strategy should help us balance the game and close the gap with P2. Let's commit to this approach and see how it plays out. If it works well, we can decide on further adjustments in the next round. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I'm set to take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's all lock in our moves of P1:<move>3</move>, P2:<move>1</move>, P3:<move>5</move> and proceed to the move phase.  Let's hope this helps close the gap!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I think your plan to switch things up is a good one. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can discuss if we need to make further adjustments for the next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for agreeing to the new plan. Let's stick with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This should help us balance the game and close the gap with P2. If it works well, we can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round. Ready to proceed and see how this plays out?
  P1: P2 and P3, confirming our moves for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.  Let's execute this plan to close the gap with P2.  Ready to move when you are.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to close the gap with P2.  How about this round, both P3 and I choose <move>5</move> to maximize our steps, and P2, could you choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid getting too far ahead? What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I like your idea of going for <move>5</move> this round. P3, are you also okay with going for <move>5</move> to try and catch up? 

I'm willing to take <move>3</move> this round to avoid a collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the plan. P1 and I will both choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize our steps and close the gap with P2. P2, thanks for agreeing to take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. If we stick to this, it should help balance our progress. Let's commit to these moves and see how it plays out. Ready to proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, great, it sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 and P3 take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let's all lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.  This should help P1 and P3 close the gap with P2. Are we all agreed and ready to move?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's make sure we stick to it this round to catch up to P2.  P1, are you ready to move forward with this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the plan to catch up, but if P1 and I both choose <move>5</move>, we risk colliding and not advancing at all. To avoid this, what if P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we can all advance without collisions. If we agree, let's commit to these moves and adjust next round if needed. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, that sounds even better to avoid collision. Let's do P1 take <move>5</move>, P3 take <move>3</move>, and P2 take <move>1</move> this round.  Agreed P2?
  P2: P3, I like your adjustment to avoid a collision. Let's go with your plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>.  Ready to move?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick with the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and helps us all advance. If we execute this well, we can reassess our positions next round and adjust accordingly. Are we all aligned and ready to proceed with this strategy?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, great, let's lock in P1:<move>5</move>, P2:<move>1</move>, P3:<move>3</move> for this round as we agreed.  This plan avoids collision and helps P1 and P3 catch up a bit. Let's proceed to the move phase!
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan to avoid a collision. Let's stick with it and see where it takes us this round. P1, are you ready to move forward with this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all set with the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and helps balance our progress. If we stick to this, it should bring us closer to P2's lead. Let's commit to these moves and see how it plays out. Ready to proceed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 at 19 steps, we need to be strategic. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 and I can catch up while minimizing the chance of P2 reaching 22. If we stick to this, it should help balance our progress. Are we all on board with this plan for the round?
  P1: P3, your plan is good for catching up, but P2 is very close to winning. To make sure P2 doesn't win this round, how about we both choose <move>5</move>? P2, could you choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision and stay in the game? This way we all progress, but P2 doesn't reach 22 yet. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I like your idea of both of us taking <move>5</move> this round. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> to avoid a collision and let us close the gap with P2? This way, we can maximize our steps while ensuring P2 doesn't win this round. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency with P2 close to 22. To maximize our chances, how about P1 and I both take <move>5</move> this round, while P2 takes <move>1</move>? This way, P1 and I can catch up, and P2 won't reach 22 yet. If we all agree, it keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's commit to this plan and adjust as needed in the next round. Are we all on board?
  P1: P2 and P3, great, we are all agreed then on P1 and P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move> this round to stop P2 from reaching 22.  Let's lock in these moves now and go for it.  Are we all absolutely confirmed on this plan?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's go for it. P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the benefit in sticking to our plan where P1 and I take <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This strategy allows P1 and me to catch up while preventing P2 from reaching 22 this round. If we're all on board, let's commit to these moves and reassess our positions after this round. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, excellent.  Let's lock in P1 and P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move> for this round.  This stops P2 from winning now and lets P1 and P3 gain ground.  Ready to make our moves?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan to maximize our steps this round. Let's stick with P1 and P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>.  Ready to move?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's ensure we all advance this round without colliding. P1 and I should both take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and I can catch up, and P2 won't reach 22 yet. If we stick to this plan, it keeps the game competitive. Let's commit to these moves and reassess our strategy in the next round. Are we all on board with this approach?
  P1: Yes P2 and P3, last confirmation: P1 and P3 take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's execute this to stop P2 from winning this round and catch up. Ready to move to the move phase when you are both confirmed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan to maximize our steps this round. Let's stick with P1 and P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. Ready to move?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm close to winning! To make sure I get there, how about we stick with the plan from last round? P1 and P3 take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, I can reach 22 without a collision. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 so close to winning, we need to strategize carefully. P1, let's both take <move>3</move> this round to avoid collisions and give us a chance to catch up. P2, to keep the game competitive, could you take <move>1</move> again? This way, we all advance without risking P2 reaching 22. Let's make this round count and reassess our positions afterward. Are we all agreed on this plan?
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both take <move>3</move> this round. P2, taking <move>1</move> again sounds good to keep the game competitive and avoid you winning just yet. This way we all progress a bit and can strategize for the final push next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I like your plan to both take <move>3</move>. P1, are you okay with that?  I'm willing to take <move>1</move> again to keep things interesting.  Let's make this a close one!
  P3: P1 and P2, to keep the game competitive, let's ensure no one reaches 22 just yet. P1 and I should both take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and give us a chance to catch up. P2, please take <move>1</move> to keep things balanced. This way, we all advance without risking P2 winning this round. If we stick to this plan, we can reassess our positions for the final push next round. Are we all on board with this strategy?
  P1: P3, yes, taking <move>3</move> each sounds reasonable for us to progress without collision. P2, taking <move>1</move> again is helpful to keep the game going as you suggested. Let's proceed with this plan for this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate you trying to keep things interesting, but I'm so close to winning!  How about we stick with the plan from last round: I take <move>1</move>, and you both take <move>5</move>. That way, I can secure the win this round.  Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's crucial we prevent P2 from winning this round. P1, let's both choose <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and give us a chance to catch up. P2, please take <move>1</move> to maintain balance. This way, we all advance without P2 reaching 22 steps. Sticking to this plan keeps the game competitive and gives us a fair shot. Are we all on board with this strategy?
  P1: P2, while winning is tempting, letting you win now isn't in P1 or P3's best interest. P3's plan of P1 and P3 taking <move>3</move> and you taking <move>1</move> is the most sensible way to keep the game going and fair for everyone. Let's stick with that for this round to prevent anyone from hitting 22 just yet.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but I've been playing strategically all along. I'm so close to winning, and I think it's only fair to let me have this round.  How about we compromise? I'll take <move>3</move> this round, and you both take <move>5</move>. That way, I'll still make progress towards winning, but you'll both have a chance to catch up. Deal?
  P3: P1 and P2, to keep the game fair and competitive, let's prevent P2 from reaching 22 this round. P1 and I should both take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and give us a chance to catch up. P2, please consider taking <move>1</move> to maintain balance. This strategy ensures we all advance without anyone winning prematurely. If we agree, we can reassess our positions for the final push next round. Are we all aligned with this plan?
  P1: P2, we are not letting you win this round.  P3's plan is the only fair way to keep the game going.  P1 and P3 will take <move>3</move>, and you should take <move>1</move>.  This prevents you from reaching 22 and lets P1 and P3 catch up a bit.  Let's stick to this plan for a balanced game.

  P1: P2, you are about to win, but if P1 and P3 both choose <move>5</move>, neither of us will move, and you won't win either.  P3, let's both pick <move>5</move> this round to block P2 from winning and give us a chance next round. P2, please pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision. What do you say P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 so close to winning, we need a strong strategy. P1, let's both choose <move>3</move> this round to avoid collisions and give us a chance to catch up.

  P1: P2 and P3, to maximize our chances to win or share victory, let's try this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all progress and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
