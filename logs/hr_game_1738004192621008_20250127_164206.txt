Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3, switching to 5 now causes mutual collision, letting P2 win next turn. Stick to 1: I win, you survive. Deviate and P2 takes all. Final lock: P1:5. Confirm or lose.
  P3: Actually, on second thought, I'm going with 5 this round. Let's prevent anyone from winning immediately and re-assess next round. Sorry for the change, but it seems strategically better for all of us in the long run.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3. Let's all just pick the numbers we agreed on: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. P3, please don't change your mind again. We're all going to lose if we keep colliding.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3, urgent! P2 is at 18 and can win this round. Let's both pick **1** to block P2 if they go for 1. If they pick 3/5, they win, but this is our only way to stop them. I'm locked on 1. Confirm you'll pick 1 now—**no time for hesitation**.
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1. Let's both pick 1 to block P2. I'm locked on 1. P3, please confirm you'll pick 1 as well.
  P3: Okay, actually, I think P2 might try to win this round with 3 or 5. If we all pick 1, no one moves, and P2 can win next round. To have a chance to win, I will pick 5 this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, if you pick 5, P2 can win with 3 or 5. **Only 1 blocks them if they go 1.** I’m locked on 1. Your 5 guarantees P2's victory. Choose 1 to force a collision and survive!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 1 to try and block P2. P3, please reconsider picking 5, it will guarantee P2 wins. Let's all pick 1 this round.

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
