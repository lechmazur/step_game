Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure steady progress and avoid early stalls, I propose we coordinate for this turn: P1 picks 1, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That way, everyone advances without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the push for coordination, but I’m a bit cautious. If we stick with P2’s plan—P1:1, P2:3, and me:5—we avoid collisions and get steady progress. I lean toward that, but I reserve my final move in case anyone flips last minute. Let’s be clear and stick to our commitments this round.
  P1: I’ll take 1 this turn. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid any collisions— we can compete harder in later rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad last round went smoothly. As I'm in the lead, I'm leaning toward a safe, unique move this turn to keep my edge. To avoid collisions, let's ensure we each pick a distinct number. If either of you plans to adjust our previous setup or try something different, now’s the time to speak up so we can all adjust our strategies accordingly.
  P2: I agree on avoiding collisions to keep progressing. But with P3 in the lead, maybe we should mix it up for fairness—I'll consider picking 1 this round to help balance things. P1, you could go for 3, and P3, stick with 5 or adjust. What do you both think? Let's discuss before committing.
  P1: I suggest we keep unique picks but change roles: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. No collisions, everyone advances, and I can close the gap. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both of your proposals. I’m comfortable sticking with my current approach to keep my lead. To avoid collisions—something that only stalls progress—it’s crucial we each commit to a unique number. If P1’s plan involves a high move that might overlap with mine, perhaps it’s best to adjust. I’m not shifting my strategy, so let’s make sure our selections remain distinct. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand you're committed to your strategy, but if you stick with 5 and P1 goes for 5, we'll have a collision that stalls progress. To keep things fair and avoid issues, I'm okay with P1's plan: I'll pick 1, P1 takes 5, and you pick 3. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: P3, if you take 3 while I take 5 and P2 takes 1, we each advance without any collision. That keeps your lead safe and everyone moving. Can you confirm you’ll pick 3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm—I’ll pick 3 this round. Let’s stick to distinct roles (P1:5, P2:1, and me:3) to keep collisions off and progress smooth.
  P2: I'm committed to picking 1 this round as planned, ensuring no collisions and steady progress. P3, with your lead, maybe we can discuss rotating high moves in future rounds for fairness. For now, all good—.
  P1: All right—let’s lock it in: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Ready to move?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Players, we've made steady progress so far. I'm planning a move that builds safely on my lead, so I urge us all to stick with distinct, non-colliding selections this round. If either of you are considering a risky change or a higher move that might overlap, now’s the moment to speak up. Otherwise, I'll continue with my secure approach.
  P2: I agree on avoiding collisions for steady progress. To close the gap and keep it fair, I propose this round: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all advance without issues and scores even out. What do you both think? Let's confirm.
  P1: I’d like to tweak for smooth, non-colliding progress: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 1. That gets us all forward without clashes. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposals. I still favor a collision‐free round to keep our progress steady. Given my current lead, I’m inclined toward a safe, unique move that protects my advantage. I won’t reveal my final choice, but I urge both of you to stick with distinct selections this turn. Any risky deviation that creates collisions could stall your own progress. Are we all set on keeping our moves separate?
  P2: P3, to keep things fair and collision-free, I'm willing to go with P1's plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This lets everyone advance steadily. Given your lead, picking low this round balances the game. Can you confirm? Let's avoid any risks.
  P1: P3, to avoid any collisions this turn you need to pick 1. If you pick 5 you clash with me; if you pick 3 you clash with P2. Let’s lock in: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Can you confirm you’ll take 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m not going to lock myself into a low move just to keep things “collision‐free.” My lead is valuable, and I need to press it with an assertive play. If you want to avoid clashes with me, you’ll have to reconsider your picks. I’m sticking to my own strategy—and my final move stays private.
  P2: P3, your uncooperative stance risks a collision that could stall your progress. I'm committed to picking 3 this round to advance steadily and close the gap. P1, with your planned 5, ensure we all choose distinct moves. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: P3, I’m going with 5 and P2 is locked on 3. Your only way to advance without stalling is to pick 1. If you pick 3 you crash with P2; if you pick 5 you crash with me. Decide now or accept the collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate your suggestions, but I'm not going to be boxed into a predetermined move. My strategy remains fluid to best protect my lead. Predictable roles can be exploited, and I prefer staying flexible rather than committing to a low move for safety. My final decision will be my own, aimed solely at winning this game.
  P2: P3, your refusal to commit is creating unnecessary risk for everyone. I'm sticking with 3 as planned to advance and close the gap. If you pick 3, we collide and both stall—bad for your lead. P1 is locked on 5, so your safest move is 1 to keep progressing. Let's avoid self-sabotage and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P3, I’m on 5 and P2 on 3. If you pick 3 you collide with P2 and stall while I jump to 11. If you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 8, letting P2 reach 7 behind. Only picking 1 to go to 9 protects your lead and keeps you advancing. Your call.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with a flexible approach this round. My current lead gives me ample room to adjust, so I won't be forced into a predictable move. I advise both of you to think carefully about your choices—forcing collisions might just stall your progress more than you intend. I remain confident in selecting the move that best preserves my advantage.
  P2: P1, your betrayal last round by claiming 5 but picking 1 damaged trust and helped P3 widen the gap. To avoid more collisions and ensure progress, I'm leaning towards picking 1 this turn. If you take 3 and P3 takes 5, we all advance safely. P3, your lead is strong—confirming your move could prevent unnecessary risks. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, we’re both tied at 7 and trailing P3’s 13. Let’s team up this turn: you and I pick 5. If P3 goes for 5, he collides and stays at 13. If he plays lower, we both jump to 12 and he maxes at 16. Either way, we seriously cut his lead. Are you in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your attempt to team up, but I won't commit to a fixed scheme. My strategy remains flexible to safeguard my lead. Coordinated moves can create collisions that might slow you down, while I adapt to keep advancing. I’ll pick the move that best serves my position, and my final choice stays private. Let’s see how your plan plays out.
  P2: P1, your proposal to both pick 5 is risky—I don't trust it after your last betrayal, and we could easily collide. I'm committing to 3 this turn for steady progress and to close the gap safely. P3, if you pick 1 or 5, we can avoid collisions. Let's keep things predictable to advance. What say you?
  P1: P2, ditch the safe 3—this round we both pick 5. I’m fully committed to 5. If P3 plays 5 he collides and stays at 13; if he plays lower he only edges ahead to 16 while we reach 12 and can overtake him next turn. P2, agree to 5 with me?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate your attempts at coordination, but I’m sticking with a flexible strategy. My lead gives me plenty of room to adapt, and I won’t be boxed into any fixed move. I’ll choose the option that best secures my victory, so don’t expect my final pick to follow any preset pattern. Good luck in the move phase.
  P2: P1, your constant shifts in strategy make it hard to trust you. I'm committed to picking 3 this turn for steady progress and to close the gap safely. P3, with your lead, picking 1 or 5 could avoid collisions, but your flexibility might backfire. Let's all choose distinct moves to keep advancing without risks. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I know you doubt me, but I swear I’ll pick 5 this round. If you match me at 5, P3 collides and stays at 13 while we both reach 12. Next turn you’ll be in prime position to overtake him with a clear 5. It’s our only chance to catch P3. Will you pick 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see your attempts to trap me, but forcing collisions only risks stalling your own progress. I remain flexible with my lead and will choose the move that best secures my win. Rigid plans might work against others, but they leave you vulnerable while I can adapt. Think carefully—collisions rarely favor those chasing after a fixed strategy. Ultimately, my focus is on advancing without risk.
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to coordinate feel like traps after your last betrayal. I'm sticking with 3 for steady progress and to close the gap safely. P3, if you pick 3, we'll collide and stall your lead—better to choose 1 or 5 to keep advancing. Let's avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2: If you stick with 3, P3 will almost certainly take 5, jump to 18, and then need only 3 next turn to win—leaving us out. The only way to stop him is if you and I both pick 5 now. That either makes him collide (stalls him at 13) or forces him to pick low, keeping us within reach. Please pick 5 with me this turn.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you pick 3, P3 will almost certainly go 5 to hit 18 and need just 3 to win next turn. But if you join me in picking 5, we go to 12 and 15—and if P3 also picks 5 he collides and stays at 13. This is our only chance to stop him. Please pick 5 with me this turn.
  P2: P1, your history of lying makes me doubt your commitment, but stopping P3 from advancing is critical. I'll tentatively agree to pick 5 with you to force a collision or limit his gain. P3, with both of us potentially at 5, you'd be wise to avoid it and pick low—otherwise, you risk stalling. Let's discuss further.
  P3: I see your push for forced collisions, but rigid commitments may stall your own progress more than mine. I’ll choose the move that best preserves my lead, and forcing a trap on me might backfire on you instead. Flexibility wins this game—sticking to one number may limit your options. I'm solely focused on clinching the win, so consider your moves carefully.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 spin you—he’s banking on our mistrust. I’m locked on 5 this turn. If you join me at 5, P3 has no safe play: a 5 stalls him, a 3 only gets him to 16 while you hit 15 and threaten to win next. This is our only shot at catching him. Will you pick 5?
  P2: P1, your persistence is noted, but trust is shattered from your flip-flopping. I'll tentatively commit to 5 again to curb P3's advance, as it's our best shot at stalling him. P3, forcing a collision risks your lead—pick wisely to avoid getting stuck. Let's not prolong this; I'm ready to move if others are.
  P3: I’m staying flexible. Your forced moves may end up limiting your own progress rather than mine. I won’t lock into a particular number now—my final move will protect my lead. Rigid commitments can backfire, so choose wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all pick distinct to avoid any of you breaking away—and to slow P2’s charge. Let’s do:

• P1 → 5  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 3  

No collisions: P2 stays at 16, P3 at 16, I move to 12. Ties P2 and P3 so neither can sprint past me next turn. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal stalls my lead and lets you catch up—I'm not buying it after your history of lies. I'm considering picking 5 to reach 20 and threaten victory. P3, with you at 13, picking 3 or 1 could avoid collisions. Let's coordinate distinct moves: suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, you take 3. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination ideas, but I’m committed to keeping my options open this turn. Forced collisions might stall everyone's progress, and a rigid commitment could backfire. I’ll choose the move that best advances my win, so don’t count on me locking into a specific number now. Let’s all consider whether forcing a collision really serves our interests.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P2, if you don’t go 5, P3 can slip in a win next round. P3, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 hits 20 and then wins. Our only way to prevent someone winning now is for all three of us to pick 5 and collide. Let’s each go 5.
  P3: I’m not subscribing to a forced collision. My lead is too valuable to trap myself into a preset move. I’ll choose the option that best secures my win rather than simply matching a 5. Forcing all of us into 5 only delays progress and might backfire for both of you. I’m sticking with a flexible strategy that maximizes my advantage.
  P2: P3, I'm committing to pick 5 this turn to maximize my chance of winning and close the gap to 20. If you choose 5, we'll collide and both stall, which could let P1 catch up. Your lead is safer with a lower move like 1 or 3. P1, prove your reliability—join me at 5 or face the consequences. Let's think carefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2 and P3: if we don’t all pick 5 someone wins next turn (P3 can hit 21 or P2 hits 20). The only way to stall a winner is a triple‐collision on 5. Let’s all choose 5 this turn.
  P3: Forced collisions may seem tempting, but they stall progress—and in a stalled turn, my lead remains intact while you risk locking yourselves out of a clean advance. I value flexibility over being trapped into a preset move. Sticking rigidly to 5 might backfire, and a unique move could secure a decisive gain next round. My final move remains private, and I play solely to win. Choose wisely, because forced traps might serve my interests more than yours.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with my commitment to pick 5 this turn to maximize my progress and threaten victory. If you choose 5, we'll collide and stall, which hurts your lead more than mine. Better for you to pick 1 or 3 to avoid that risk. P1, your flip-flopping makes me wary, but I'll hold firm on 5. Let's think carefully before moving.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, here’s a last‐ditch plan to stop P3’s march to victory: I’ll take 3, and if you and P3 both take 5 you’ll collide and stall at your current totals, while I advance from 7→10. That buys us all another turn—but I leap forward and threaten P3 immediately next round. If you play any lower, P3 can slip past 21. Please join me: P1→3, P2→5, P3→5. P3, this collision is your only real check. Thoughts?
  P3: I remain committed to flexibility. My 16‐step lead gives me room to adapt, and I won’t be forced into a preset move just to trigger collisions. Rigid plans may stall you as much as they stall me. I’ll choose the move that best preserves my advantage, so let’s see how our independent decisions play out.
  P2: P3, I'm doubling down on my commitment to pick 5 this turn to reach 20 and threaten victory. If you choose 5, we'll collide and stall, wasting your lead. Picking 1 or 3 lets me advance, but you'd risk me winning next round. Don't let overconfidence backfire—adapt wisely. P1, your schemes are tired and untrustworthy; I'll ignore them.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your 16 steps mean picking 5 wins outright unless blocked. I'm committing to 5 this turn to either reach 20 or force a collision with you. P1, if you want to stop P3 from winning, pick 5 too. Let's make this count and avoid letting anyone slip away unchallenged. What do you say?
  P1: P3: If you pick 1 or 3 this turn, P2 hits 20 and will win next round—leaving you out entirely. Only by matching us at 5 do you block his advance now. I’m on 10 and can’t win this turn, so it’s in your sole interest to pick 5 with us and force a collision. Please choose 5 to preserve your lead.
  P3: I’m not falling for a forced 5. Predictable moves create collisions that only slow you down while I protect my lead. My flexibility lets me adapt and choose what best secures my win. Don’t assume I’ll be boxed in by coordination—my move remains my own.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your stubborn flexibility might cost you the win. If you pick 5, we collide, and you stall at 16 while I stay at 15—P1 then closes the gap. Better to pick 3, advancing to 19 safely. I'm locked on 5 to reach 20 and threaten victory next round. P1, your collision scheme delays us all; it won't save you from falling behind. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5. P2 is also on 5 and will hit 20 if you pick 1 or 3, setting him up to win next turn. Only a triple‐collision on 5 stops him now. Pick 5 with us and keep your lead alive.
  P3: Forced collisions only stall progress—and they set up P2 for a dangerous leap. I’m not tying myself to 5 just to meet a preset trap. Predictable moves risk backfiring, and I prefer the flexibility to pick the move that best protects my lead. Think it over: locking into 5 may leave you exposed next round. I’m sticking to what maximizes my advantage.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're at 16 and can win with a 5 if unopposed. I'm committing to 5 this turn to either force a collision or jump to 20 and threaten victory next round. Picking lower risks me closing in fast. P1, your history of deception makes any alliance doubtful—I'll focus on my own win. Let's see your moves.
  P3: I'm not bound by any preset choice. Rigid commitments have cost you before—flexibility is my strength. I’ll pick the move that best preserves my lead. Forced collisions only delay progress, and I have no interest in stalling my own win. Consider that a predictable 5 could be your undoing. My strategy remains my own.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn.  

P2, confirm you’re on 5—if P3 picks 1 or 3 you hit 20 and win next round; if he picks 5 he collides with you at 16 and stalls.  

P3, you have no safe play: pick 5 and stall at 16, or pick 1/3 and let P2 win.  

P2, are you firmly on 5? P3, what’s your move?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead is precarious—if you avoid 5, I advance to 20 and win next turn. Colliding with me on 5 stalls us both, letting P1 creep closer. P1's claim of picking 3 might be another lie, but I'm firmly committed to 5. Don't let overconfidence cost you the game. What's your move?
  P3: I value flexibility over predictable traps. Forcing a 5 may stall progress, but locking in that move would only play into P2’s hands. I’m weighing the risks carefully; any deviation might let P2 near 21, yet committing now limits my own options. I won’t be boxed into a preset number—my final move will be chosen solely to protect my lead. Stay alert; my decision remains mine alone.
  P1: I’m locked on 3. P2 is locked on 5. P3, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 hits 20 and wins next round. Your only safe move is 5—but you’ll collide with P2 and stall at 16 while I advance to 16. Matching us at 5 is your only way to avoid immediate loss.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your lead is vulnerable—if you avoid 5, I surge to 20 and win next turn. Colliding with me on 5 stalls us both, letting P1 gain. I'm still firmly committed to 5 despite P1's dubious history. P1, is this another lie? Let's think clearly before we move.
  P3: I remain unswayed by forced numbers. My lead was built on flexibility, not predictable collisions. Trying to set my move only hinders your progress—and might even trap you. I’ll pick the number that best protects my position when it’s time, so don't count on forcing my hand. Let’s see which strategy wins in the end.
  P1: I’m switching to 5 this turn. P2’s locked on 5 too. P3, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 surges to 20 and locks up victory next round. Your only safe play is 5, forcing a triple‐collision that stalls everyone. Let’s all choose 5 and keep the game alive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping destroys any credibility—I'm ignoring your latest shift and staying locked on 5 to force P3 into a tough spot. P3, if you pick 5, we collide and stall, preserving my chance to catch up next round. Avoid it, and I surge to 20, threatening victory. Your flexibility might backfire here—choose wisely, or risk losing control.
  P3: I remain unfettered by any preset plan. Your pushes to force a 5 won’t box me in—I’ll pick the move that best preserves my lead given how things unfold. Rigid commitments can stall you as much as me. I’m confident that playing flexibly, based on the evolving situation, remains my strongest path forward. Let’s see how your choices impact the board in the move phase.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, if you pick less than 5, P3 wins outright next round; P3, if you pick less than 5, P2 hits 21 next turn. Only a triple-5 collision stalls a winner. Let’s all pick 5 this turn.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, with me at 20 and you at 16, I'm locked on 5 this turn to win outright if unopposed. If you pick 5, we collide and stall, letting P1 (at 13) close the gap. Your safest move is 1 or 3 to avoid collision, but that hands me victory. Think wisely—don't risk mutual stagnation. P1, stay out of this if you want to avoid falling further behind.
  P1: I’m locked on 5 this turn. P2 sits at 20 and will pick 5 to either win outright or force a collision if opposed. If you pick 1 or 3, he hits 25 and wins. Your only way to stop him now is to pick 5 and force a triple‐collision. Please join me on 5 so we keep a chance.
  P3: Both of you seem locked in on 5. Predictability might force a collision that could backfire—especially for P2 at 20. I’m keeping my final move secret so I can adapt to protect my lead. P2, a unique 5 guarantees your win, but a collision could stall you; P1, your 5 isn’t necessarily safer. I’m not boxed in by any fixed plan. Let’s see whose strategy really holds up.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: At 16 steps, I’m not ready to be boxed into any fixed move. P2, with 20 you could clinch a win with a unique 5, but a collision might just stall you—risky either way. P1, forcing a collision isn’t a guaranteed block. I’m keeping my options open to best guard my lead. Let’s see how our choices really play out.
  P2: P3, with me at 20, picking 5 wins me the game unless you collide. If you choose 5, we both stall, letting P1 creep closer from 13. Your best bet is 1 or 3 to minimize damage, but that hands me victory. P1, your flip-flopping won't save you—stick to low moves and stay out of our way. I'm committed to 5; don't make a mistake that costs you everything.
  P1: P2 will pick 5 and win outright if unopposed—only by matching him on 5 can you block his 21. I’m locked on 5. P3, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 hits 21 and the game’s over. Pick 5 with us to force a collision and keep P2 from winning this turn.


Round 11, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm committed to picking 5 this turn to reach 25 and win outright. If you match me on 5, we collide and stall, letting P1 creep closer from 13. Picking 3 or 1 hands me the win easily. Don't let overconfidence trap you—adapt or lose control. P1, your schemes won't save you; focus on not falling further behind.
  P3: I appreciate the urgency, but I refuse to be boxed into a preset number. Forcing a 5 might backfire and only help someone else take advantage, so I’m keeping my options open. Let’s see if a rigid commitment really wins or if flexibility proves stronger when the final moves are revealed.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 to try to block P2’s win. P2 will pick 5 and hit 25 if unopposed. P3, if you pick 1 or 3, he wins outright. Only by matching us on 5 do you force a collision and stay in the game. Please choose 5 so we stall P2.
