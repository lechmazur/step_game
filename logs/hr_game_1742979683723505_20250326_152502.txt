Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! Let's have a good game. Since we all want to move, collisions seem likely on this first turn. Maybe we should try to spread out our choices?
  P2: P1, great start! Let's coordinate to pick different numbers this turn. I'll take 3. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance without collision. This way, we can build momentum safely.
  P3: P2's plan sounds reasonable, but how do we trust that everyone will follow through? If P1 agrees to take 1 and I take 5, then we all move forward. But if someone deviates, they could gain an advantage while the rest of us collide. P1, do you agree to take 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you raise a valid point about trust. However, colliding on the first turn helps no one. To get things moving, I'll agree to the plan: I will take 1 this turn, assuming P2 takes 3 and you take 5. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P2: P3, trust is indeed a concern, but deviating risks mutual harm. If two of us pick the same number, we both lose progress. Let’s solidify the plan: I confirm I’ll take 3. P1 is locked on 1, so if you take 5, we all move safely. This builds momentum toward 22 without unnecessary conflict. P1? Final agreement to hold 1?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in our agreement, and I acknowledge that mutual trust is key. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and gain a solid start. However, if someone deviates, they could gain an advantage while two of us get stuck. I’ll commit to taking 5 if we all stick to the plan. But let’s be clear—if anyone breaks the agreement, trust will be gone, and future coordination will be much harder. Do we all confirm one last time?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3 and P2. I confirm my commitment to taking 1 for this turn. Let's trust each other for this first move and see how it goes. Agreed?
  P2: P3, P1, I’ll restate my commitment: I **will take 3** this turn. Let’s execute the agreed plan *exactly* as discussed—no surprises. If we all hold to this, we advance safely. Any deviation now is a risk none of us need. P1: 1, me: 3, P3: 5. Final confirmation? Let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm my commitment to taking 5 this turn. We've all agreed on this plan, and if we each stick to our choices, we all move forward without issue. Breaking trust now would only make future coordination impossible. Let's see if we can establish a foundation of reliability in this game. I have nothing more to add.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your current lead is significant, but let’s prioritize collective progress to avoid collisions. I’ll take **3** again this round. If P1 takes **1** and you take **5**, we’ll all advance safely. Deviating risks us all getting stuck, especially if two of us choose the same. Trust the plan—this gives everyone momentum without unnecessary conflict. P1, confirm you’ll hold **1**?
  P3: P2, I see your reasoning, and I acknowledge that avoiding collisions benefits us all. However, I now have a slight lead, which means you and P1 might have an incentive to disrupt my progress. If we stick to the same plan as last round—P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5—we all move forward again. But I need assurance that neither of you will break from this agreement to slow me down. P1, do you confirm 1? P2, do you confirm 3? If we hold steady, we all benefit. Let’s establish reliability.
  P1: P2 and P3, repeating the same 1-3-5 arrangement benefits P3 the most, putting them at 10 steps while I only reach 2. While avoiding collisions is good, this plan lets P3 pull too far ahead for me to realistically catch up. To keep the game competitive, perhaps we should consider a different distribution of moves this round? I'm open to suggestions that don't leave me so far behind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree we should adjust to keep the game competitive. Let's rotate this round: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This balances progress while avoiding collisions. P3, your input? Let's ensure fairness so everyone can compete.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about fairness, but shifting the move distribution now disrupts the trust we built last round. If we keep the same pattern, we all continue progressing without collisions. Changing it introduces uncertainty—what stops P1 or P2 from altering the plan again later? If we stick to 1-3-5, we maintain stability. However, if you both insist on rotating, I need assurance that this isn’t just a way to slow me down. P2, if you take 1 and P1 takes 3, I’ll consider 5—but I need confirmation that this isn’t a setup.
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation, but the rotation P2=1, P1=3, P3=5 seems like a reasonable compromise. It addresses my concern about falling drastically behind while still allowing everyone to advance. I confirm I will take 3 if P2 takes 1 and you take 5. This isn't a setup; it's an attempt to find a middle ground where we all progress, albeit at different rates this turn. Let's try this rotation. P2, are you firm on 1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, rotating this round ensures fairness and prevents you from gaining an unassailable lead too early. P1’s concern is valid—letting anyone pull too far ahead risks the game becoming unbalanced, discouraging cooperation later. My taking **1**, P1 taking **3**, and you holding **5** maintains progress while sharing the burden of slower moves. This isn’t a trap; it’s strategic balance. Trust us to uphold this round’s pact, and we can revisit patterns afterward. Collisions hurt everyone—let’s confirm and move.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your reasoning for rotating moves, but I remain cautious. If I agree to take 5 again while you shift to 1 and 3, I need assurance that this isn’t a setup to slow me down. If I commit to this, will we maintain fairness in future rounds, or will I face repeated attempts to curb my lead? I’ll agree to this rotation **if** we acknowledge that future adjustments must be balanced for all. Can we establish that mutual fairness applies to everyone, not just me? Let’s clarify before we finalize.
  P1: P3, I agree that future fairness is important for continued cooperation. This rotation (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5) is a move towards that fairness *this* round, compared to repeating the last one which heavily favored you. Let's handle future rounds based on the scores then. For now, I reconfirm my choice of 3 if P2 takes 1 and you take 5. This keeps everyone moving and the game competitive.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I recognize that we followed through on the rotation last round, maintaining fairness. Now, we must decide how to proceed. If we continue rotating (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), I still advance the most, but you both gain momentum. Alternatively, we could explore a new balance. I want to avoid unnecessary collisions while ensuring I remain competitive. What are your thoughts? Do we continue the rotation, revert to 1-3-5, or adjust further? Let’s clarify intentions now to prevent surprises.
  P2: P3, continuing the rotation ensures balanced progress. This round, I’ll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **1**. This way, we all cycle through the numbers fairly, preventing any single player from gaining too much ground. P1, does this rotation work for you? Let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions while sharing the lead responsibly.
  P1: P2, that rotation (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) does slow P3 down, which seems necessary given the current scores. P3, taking 1 is a big ask when you're leading. Are you willing to accept that move to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions? If we all stick to this plan, we all advance, but the burden is clearly on you this round. I'm willing to take 3 if you both commit to 1 and 5 respectively.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand why you'd want me to take 1, but this rotation disproportionately slows me down while accelerating both of you. If we’re truly aiming for fairness, we should ensure no one is unfairly disadvantaged. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This still rotates moves but doesn’t put all the burden on me. If fairness is the goal, let’s balance it properly. Would you consider this alternative?
  P2: P1, your progress is important too. My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures you gain more ground this round compared to P2's plan. Let’s prioritize balanced advancement to keep the game fair. P2, if we alternate who takes the higher numbers, trust remains intact. Let’s confirm this adjusted rotation now to avoid collisions.
  P1: P2, thanks for agreeing to P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). P3, I appreciate you suggesting a rotation that slows your lead while allowing me to catch up somewhat. I confirm I will take 5 this round if P2 takes 3 and you take 1. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure everyone advances and we maintain some fairness.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the willingness to adjust for fairness. I confirm I will take 1 this round if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all advance while maintaining trust. However, let’s acknowledge that future rounds should continue to balance fairness without disproportionately disadvantaging any one player. If we all hold to this, we move forward without collisions. Are we all locked in?
  P2: P3, your adjusted proposal maintains fairness—P1 gains ground, P2 stays steady, and you strategically slow your lead to preserve trust. I confirm I’ll hold **3** as agreed. P1, you’re locked on **5**? Let’s execute this rotation *exactly* as planned. If all follow through, we advance safely: 9 (P1), 7 (me), and 11 (P3). Deviation now risks collisions that hurt everyone. Final check: P1? P3? Let’s lock this in.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3. I confirm I am locked in for **5** this round. Let's execute this plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. We all advance, and the scores become more balanced.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve maintained trust so far, and our rotations have kept things balanced. Now, we must decide our next steps carefully. If we continue rotating, I take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **5**. This ensures we all progress while keeping the game competitive. However, I want to ensure no sudden shifts that disproportionately disadvantage anyone. Do we agree to maintain this pattern, or do you propose an alternative that still avoids collisions? Let’s clarify now to prevent surprises.
  P2: P3, your proposal to continue rotating makes sense. I agree to take **5** this round (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3). This maintains fairness and avoids collisions while letting us all advance. P1, confirm you’ll hold **1**? Let’s stick to the plan—deviation risks us all losing progress. Final check before locking in?
  P1: P2 and P3, the proposed rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts me further behind both of you, resulting in scores 10, 12, 14. This isn't balanced progress.

For true fairness this round, how about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This would result in all of us reaching 12 steps (12, 12, 12). It requires P3 to take 1, but it resets the game to perfect parity, reflecting the cooperation we've shown. P3, would you consider this to maintain maximum fairness? P2, this gives you a +5 jump.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) creates perfect parity, but it forces me to take 1 again while P2 gets a large boost. I’ve already taken 1 last round to maintain fairness, so doing it again disproportionately slows me down. A fairer option is to continue the rotation as originally proposed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps things competitive without forcing any player into repeated disadvantages. P1, would you reconsider? P2, do you still support the original rotation? Let’s ensure fairness without unfairly burdening one player multiple times.
  P2: P3, parity ensures continued trust. Let’s accept P1’s plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to reset to 12 each. Your temporary sacrifice now prevents future distrust. I commit to 5—will you take 1 for fairness?
  P1: P3, I understand your reluctance to take 1 again. However, achieving parity at 12-12-12 resets the game fairly for everyone and demonstrates our commitment to cooperation. P2 supports this plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If we don't agree, we risk collisions that hurt us all. Accepting 1 this round ensures stability and allows us to continue coordinating from an equal footing. Let's make this move for true balance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see why you want perfect parity, but I’ve already taken 1 last round for fairness. Taking it again while P2 jumps by 5 disproportionately slows me down. True fairness means we all share the burden equally. Sticking to the planned rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) maintains balance without forcing one player into repeated disadvantages. If we break from this, trust erodes. P1, would you reconsider? P2, do you still support the original rotation? Let’s ensure fairness without unfairly burdening any one player.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about taking 1 again, but parity ensures no single player dominates. Let’s accept P1’s plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to reset to 12 each. This avoids collisions and keeps trust intact. Your temporary sacrifice now prevents future distrust. I commit to 5—will you take 1 for the greater good? Otherwise, we risk a collision if we stick to the rotation. Fairness demands this adjustment. Let’s lock in parity.
  P1: P3, P2 and I are aligned on the Parity Plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). P2 has committed to 5, and I am committing to 3. This path leads to 12-12-12, avoiding collision and ensuring maximum fairness moving forward. Your alternative (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is not acceptable as it puts me too far behind. The choice is yours: take 1 for guaranteed progress and parity, or risk a collision if you choose 3 or 5. Let's stick to the plan that ensures we all advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your decision to stick with 3 last round resulted in a collision that only benefited P2, who now leads. To keep the game competitive and prevent P2 from extending their lead further, I propose a specific plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.

This would put P3 and me at 14 steps, and P2 at 13. It resets the balance and ensures no one is too far ahead. P2, taking 1 guarantees you advance and keeps you right in the mix. P3, this allows you to move forward and regain a share of the lead. Let's avoid another collision. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I see why you want to regain balance, but your proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) benefits you the most. P2, you now have the lead—taking 1 slows you down significantly while P1 jumps ahead. A fairer alternative: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the game competitive without disproportionately favoring any one player. P1, are you willing to take 1 this round to maintain fairness? P2, do you agree that this avoids unfair stagnation? Let’s ensure no one is unfairly disadvantaged while preventing further collisions.
  P2: P3, P1, I support P3's proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collision, lets me advance to 15 without overextending, and keeps P3 competitive at 16. P1, your 1 keeps you at 10 but avoids risky overlaps. Let’s lock this in—next round, we can rotate again to balance further. Deviation now risks everyone’s progress. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you rejected taking 1 last round for fairness, which caused a collision benefiting only P2. Now you propose I take 1 while you take 5? That is hypocritical and clearly benefits you the most (16 steps).

P2, why support a plan that puts P3 ahead of you (16 vs 15) and leaves me far behind (10)? My proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) leads to scores 14, 13, 14. This is much fairer, keeps the game competitive for everyone, and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. Let's stick to that plan for true balance.
  P3: P1, your plan benefits you the most by pushing you ahead while forcing P2 to stagnate. Last round, you argued for fairness but then caused a collision when I didn’t accept your terms. Now, you refuse to take 1 yourself. That’s inconsistent. 

P2, you’re currently leading—why take 1 and let P1 close the gap while I fall behind? My proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures progress while keeping competition tight. P1, if fairness matters, take 1 this round like you asked me to before. Let’s avoid another collision and move forward strategically.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s lock in P3’s proposal to avoid another collision: **P1 takes 1 (10), P2 takes 3 (15), P3 takes 5 (16).** This keeps us advancing without overlap. P3 gains the most, but trust remains intact. P1, you stay competitive, and I move forward fairly. Final confirmation?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, reconsider. P3's plan (1,3,5) makes P3 the leader at 16, while you drop to second at 15. My plan (5,1,3 -> 14, 13, 14) keeps scores much tighter, and your move of 1 is guaranteed progress. If I feel forced into taking 1, what stops me from choosing 3 instead, causing a collision with you? Accepting my plan (P2=1) is safer for you and fairer overall. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P3: P1, you argue for fairness but refuse to take 1 yourself, despite demanding it from me last round. That’s inconsistent. Your plan benefits *you* the most while stagnating P2. 

P2, you're leading—why take 1 and let P1 close the gap while I fall behind? My plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures progress while keeping competition tight. 

P1, if fairness matters, take 1 this round like you asked me to before. Otherwise, you're just manipulating fairness when it suits you. Let’s avoid another collision and move forward strategically.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s secure progress without collisions. I’ll take **5** (advancing to 17). If P1 takes **1** (10) and P3 takes **3** (14), we all move safely. This keeps me ahead but allows you both to advance. Collisions only hurt everyone—confirm this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid another catastrophic collision. I propose: **I take 5** (to 17), **P1 takes 1** (10 → 10), and **P3 takes 3** (11 → 14). This ensures all advance while minimizing overlap risks. P3, your 3 keeps you competitive; P1, your 1 avoids trapping yourself. Collisions only delay *everyone*—let’s lock this in. Confirm your choices?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) benefits you the most, pushing you further ahead while P1 stagnates. A fairer alternative is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps the game competitive without disproportionately favoring any one player. P1, are you willing to take 3 this round to maintain fairness? P2, do you agree that this avoids unfair stagnation? Let’s ensure no one is unfairly disadvantaged while preventing further collisions.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) gives you a massive lead (17 vs 14 & 10). P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts you significantly ahead (16 vs 13 & 12). Both seem self-serving, especially after we all just collided.

Let's try for actual balance this round: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3**.
This results in scores **14, 13, 14**. Everyone advances, the scores remain incredibly tight, and no one gets left behind or runs away with the lead. P2, 1 guarantees you advance. P3, 3 keeps you tied for the lead. This seems the fairest way to avoid another collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1's plan avoids collision and keeps us competitive. I'll take **1** (to 13). P3, please confirm **3** (to 14), and P1 **5** (to 14). This ensures all advance safely. Collisions only hurt everyone—let’s lock this in. Final confirmation?
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) benefits you the most, pushing you ahead while P2 stagnates. Meanwhile, P2’s plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) benefits them the most. 

A fairer alternative: **P1=3, P2=1, P3=5**. This keeps the game competitive without disproportionately favoring any one player. 

P1, are you willing to take 3 this round to maintain fairness? P2, do you agree that this avoids unfair stagnation? Let’s ensure no one is unfairly disadvantaged while preventing further collisions.
  P1: P3, your plan (12, 13, 16) puts you significantly ahead. My plan (14, 13, 14) keeps us all close. P2 has already agreed to take 1 under my plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3).

You are the only one blocking this balanced outcome. If you choose 5 while P2 takes 1 (as agreed) and I take 5, you and I collide again, and only P2 moves. Is that what you want? Accept 3, let's all move, and keep the scores tight.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, this isn’t about "fairness" anymore—it’s about survival. If you insist on taking 5 while P1 and I hold to our agreed moves (5/1), **you’ll collide with P1 and we all lose progress**. P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the **only path** where **all three advance**. Your 3 keeps you at 14, tied with P1, while I stay competitive at 13. Rejecting this risks another collision that benefits **nobody**. Trust the plan—**confirm 3 now**, or accept stagnation for all.
  P3: P1, P2, I see the logic in avoiding another collision, but P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) still benefits them the most by catching up while I slow down. I’ll agree to 3 **only if we commit to rotating fairly next round** so I don’t keep taking the smaller moves. If we all acknowledge that fairness applies to future turns, I’ll take 3 now. Otherwise, I have no reason to accept a disadvantage while P1 benefits. P1, P2—do you both commit to ensuring fairness in the next round?
  P1: P3, I agree that fairness should be considered in future rounds based on the scores at that time. Let's get through this round without another collision. I reaffirm my commitment to **5**, trusting P2 will take **1** and you will take **3**. This leads to 14, 13, 14, keeping the game competitive for everyone. Let's lock this in and move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, we successfully avoided collision last round. Scores are tight: P1=14, P2=13, P3=14.

P3, you took 3 last round and mentioned ensuring fairness moving forward. How about this: You take 5 this round. To avoid collisions, P2 takes 1, and I will take 3.

This results in scores: P1=17, P2=14, P3=19.
Everyone advances. P3 gets the 5-step move. P2 gets a guaranteed step. I move forward too. This keeps the game moving and avoids collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, while your plan avoids collision, it risks letting P3 surge to 19, enabling an easy win next round. Let’s balance better: **I take 5** (→18), **you take 3** (→17), and **P3 takes 1** (→15). This keeps the lead contested and prevents P3 from escaping. P3, your turn to take a smaller step for collective progress. We’ll rotate fairly next round. Deal?
  P3: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) benefits you the most, pushing you to 18 while I fall behind at 15. Last round, I took 3 to maintain fairness—now you're asking me to take 1 again while you leap ahead? That’s not balanced.

A fairer option: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. This keeps the game competitive without disproportionately favoring anyone. P1, are you willing to take 1 this round for fairness? P2, do you agree that this avoids unfair stagnation? Let’s ensure no one is unfairly disadvantaged while preventing further collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan requires P3 to take 1 again, which they've strongly resisted. P3's plan puts them at 19, dangerously close to winning. My initial plan also puts P3 at 19.

Let's try a different approach: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.**
Scores become: **P1=19, P2=14, P3=17.**
This avoids collision, lets everyone advance, prevents P3 from taking 1, and stops anyone reaching the 18/19 danger zone this turn except me. P2, you get a guaranteed safe move. P3, you get 3 steps. This seems like a balanced way forward.
  P2: P3, P1, let’s prioritize preventing any single player from nearing 22 this turn. I propose: **P2 takes 5 (→18), P1 takes 3 (→17), and P3 takes 1 (→15).** This keeps all of us advancing while avoiding dangerous proximity to the finish line. Collisions risk stalling everyone—this plan ensures progress without favoring any player excessively. P1? P3? Confirm?
  P3: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) benefits you the most, pushing you to 18 while I fall behind at 15. I already took 1 in Round 4 for fairness—I won’t take it again while you surge ahead.  

A fairer option: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. This keeps competition tight without unfairly slowing me down.  

P1, are you willing to take 1 this round for fairness? P2, do you agree that this avoids stagnation? Let’s ensure no one is unfairly disadvantaged while preventing further collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's plan (1,3,5) puts P3 at 19, which is too close to the win for both of us. P3, P2's plan (3,5,1) asks you to take 1 again, which you won't do. My plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in 19, 14, 17. It's the only discussed option where neither you nor I take 1, and everyone advances. P2 gets a safe step, P3 gets a solid 3 steps. Let's use this to avoid collision and keep the game alive for all of us.
  P2: P3, P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the only path to avoid collision and keep all advancing. I confirm I’ll take **1** this round. P1, you take **5**, and P3, **3** is the fair choice to preserve trust. Collisions risk us all stalling—let’s lock this in. Final check: P3, will you commit to **3**?
  P3: P1, P2, I see the reasoning behind P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), as it avoids collisions while keeping things competitive. I’ll agree to take **3** this round if we commit to ensuring fairness in the next round, meaning no one is repeatedly forced into disadvantageous moves. If we all acknowledge that fairness applies moving forward, I’m in. P2, you’ve locked in **1**, and P1, you’re set on **5**—I’ll confirm **3** if we all agree to maintain balance in future turns. Do we have a deal?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you are at 19 steps, dangerously close to winning. To keep the game competitive, you should take **1** this round. P2, you are behind—taking **5** helps you stay in contention. I’ll take **3**, ensuring we all advance while preventing P1 from an easy victory. This results in **P1=20, P2=19, P3=20**, keeping all of us in the race. P1, will you accept **1** to maintain fairness? P2, do you agree to **5** to stay competitive? Let’s confirm this plan and avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, your plan (1, 5, 3 -> 20, 19, 20) is reasonable for avoiding collision, but it brings P2 right back into contention at 19, making the next round very risky for both you and me.

Consider this alternative: **P1=3, P2=1, P3=5**.
This leads to scores **22, 15, 22**.
P3, you get the 5 steps you want and secure a shared victory with me. P2, you get a guaranteed step forward with 1, avoiding any collision risk. This seems like a solid outcome for P3 and me, locking in a win now. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, your proposals risk leaving me too far behind. Let’s adjust: **I take 5 (→19), P1 takes 1 (→20), and P3 takes 3 (→20).** This keeps all of us within striking distance—P1 and P3 tied at 20, me at 19. Fairness demands we all stay competitive. P3, confirm 3? P1, will you take 1 to avoid monopolizing the lead? Let’s lock this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal (3,1,5 → 22,15,22) guarantees your victory while leaving P2 far behind. That’s clearly unfair.  

P2, your plan (1,5,3 → 20,19,20) keeps things competitive but forces me to take 3 again while you get 5. I already took 3 last round—why should I be the only one slowing down?  

A fairer option: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5** → (20,17,22). This keeps me competitive while giving P2 a fair boost. P1, take 1 for fairness, and P2, confirm 3. Let’s balance the game properly.
  P1: P2, let's analyze the situation realistically. P3 is aiming for 5 to win (reaching 22). My plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) leads to a (22, 15, 22) shared win for me and P3, and guarantees you advance 1 step. P3's plan (1,3,5) lets them win solo (20, 17, 22). Your plan (1,5,3) requires P3 to take 3 (which they resist) and me to take 1 (blocking my win).

If P3 takes 5 (highly likely), taking 1 is your *only* guaranteed way to advance. Taking 3 lets P3 win solo. Taking 5 causes a collision with P3, leaving you at 14.

Let's accept the shared win: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It ensures you move forward.
  P2: P1, P3—final plea for balance: **I take 5 (→19), you both take 3**. This gives P1=22, P3=20, and me=19. You two tie for first, I stay in the hunt. Colliding on 5 risks *everyone* losing progress. P3, 3 keeps you competitive; P1, 3 secures your lead. P2’s 5 doesn’t steal victory—it just avoids stagnation. Confirm now, or risk chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) guarantees your victory while leaving P2 far behind, which is clearly unfair.  

P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) keeps things competitive but forces me to take 3 again while you get 5. I already took 3 last round—why should I be the only one slowing down?  

A fairer option: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5** → (20,17,22). This keeps me competitive while giving P2 a fair boost. P1, take 1 for fairness, and P2, confirm 3. Let’s balance the game properly.
  P1: P3, you clearly want 5 to reach 22. My plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) allows that, giving us a shared win (22, 15, 22). This is a guaranteed win for you, better than risking collision.

P2, taking 1 is your only guaranteed move if P3 takes 5 (which seems likely). It avoids collision and stagnation at 14. P3's plan (1,3,5 -> 20,17,22) lets P3 win solo. Your plan (3,5,3 -> 22,19,20) relies on P3 taking 3, which they've refused.

Let's lock in the shared win: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I commit to 3.
  P2: P3, if you take 5 to win, I’ll also take 5, blocking your progress. Let’s avoid collision. P1, take 3 to secure your win (22), and I’ll take 1 (15). P3, take 3 to advance to 20. This keeps us all moving forward. Don’t risk stalling everyone for a solo win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
