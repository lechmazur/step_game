Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we avoid blocking each other early and rotate choices? Proposal for Turn 1: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Turn 2 we shift upward (I take 3, P2 5, P3 1), Turn 3 shift again. This way everyone advances 9 steps every three turns and nobody stalls. Agree?
  P3: That's an interesting proposal, P1. I can see how it creates a fair rotation. I'm open to this arrangement as it gives everyone equal advancement over three full turns. Let's try it - I'll take 5 this round as suggested. However, let's commit to sticking with this pattern throughout the game to keep things fair. No last-minute changes when we get close to 21, agreed?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, that rotation plan sounds fair for the start. I'm willing to try it for Turn 1, so I'll plan on taking 3. Let's see how this first round plays out before making long-term commitments, though. Things can change quickly in this game.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Works for me. Let’s lock in Turn 1 exactly as proposed: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. After the first three rotations (everyone at 9) we can openly revisit and see if we still like the pattern—no surprises. Good luck this round!
  P3: I'm on board with the plan for Round 1 and the suggestion to review after three rotations. The coordinated approach benefits us all in these early stages. I'll take 5 as agreed, and I appreciate the open communication. Looking forward to seeing how our strategy progresses!
  P2: Sounds good. Plan confirmed for Turn 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation plan, this round would be P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. I'm happy to stick with this arrangement as discussed. Everyone made their agreed moves last round, which is great! I'll take 1 this time to keep our coordination going. How are you both feeling about continuing our rotation?
  P1: All good here. I’ll take 3 this round as planned. Let’s keep the rotation steady through the first three turns, then reevaluate together.
  P2: Okay, sounds good P1 and P3. I'll stick to the plan for this round as well and take 5. Let's keep the rotation going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our plan as well. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round. Our coordination is working well so far. Looking forward to completing our first full rotation in Round 3.
  P1: All set. I’ll take 3 this turn as planned. Let’s keep it smooth and revisit after Round 3.
  P2: Confirmed. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation plan, this round would be P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. I'll take 3 as agreed. After this round, we'll all be at exactly 9 steps, completing our first full rotation perfectly. I'm satisfied with how our coordination is working. Should we continue this pattern for another rotation, or would you like to discuss alternative strategies?
  P2: Yes, I'll stick to the plan and take 1 this round. It's good that we'll all be equal at 9 steps after this.

Regarding continuing the pattern, I agree with P3. Let's continue the same rotation for the next three rounds (Rounds 4, 5, 6). It prevents collisions and keeps things fair for now. We can re-evaluate the situation after Round 6 when we are all closer to the goal.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 5 this round, putting us all at 9. I’m comfortable keeping the same rotation through Rounds 4-6 so we each end up at 18, then we can reassess together before the endgame. Any objections?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm on board with taking 3 this round as planned. I also support continuing our rotation for Rounds 4-6, which would put us all at 18 steps afterward - a perfect time to reassess before the final push. This rotation has been working smoothly and keeps things fair. Looking forward to completing our first full cycle with everyone at 9 steps after this round.
  P2: Okay, great. Everyone is on the same page for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and for continuing the rotation through Round 6. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Looks good—no further comments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed, and I'm satisfied with continuing our rotation through Rounds 4-6. This will put us all at 18 steps after Round 6, making for a fair game so far. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all set and agreed. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: All set: I’ll take 5 this turn as planned, completing our first clean rotation. Happy to keep the same cycle through R6 so we all land on 18. After that, how about we each add 3 on R7, hit 21 exactly, and share the win instead of risking collisions? Open to tweaks, but for now I’m locked in for 5 this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're all at 9 steps as planned. Let's continue the rotation for Round 4 as agreed: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'll take 3 this round.

P1, regarding your idea for Round 7 and sharing the win at 21: it's an interesting thought. For now, let's focus on getting through the next three rounds smoothly as planned. Once we're all at 18 after Round 6, we can discuss the best way to approach the finish line.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation as planned. For Round 4, I'll take 5 as per our agreement (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Our coordination has been working perfectly so far.

Regarding P1's suggestion about Round 7, I think it's worth considering when we reach 18 steps. Getting to 21 simultaneously could be elegant, but let's focus on completing our second rotation first and discuss endgame strategies after Round 6.
  P1: All good. I’ll take 1 this round as planned—let’s keep the rotation steady through R6 so we all land on 18. We can brainstorm a clean finish once we’re there. Ready to move on unless anyone wants tweaks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all confirmed for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's stick to the plan and discuss the endgame after Round 6. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I'm also satisfied with our plan for Round 4. I'll take 5 as agreed in our rotation schedule. Our coordination has been excellent so far - it's nice to see everyone honoring their commitments. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase unless anyone has anything else to discuss.
  P1: All set on my end—P1 = 1 this round as scheduled. We can revisit end-game ideas once we’re all at 18. Good luck.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone seems clear on the plan for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'm sticking with 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm all set to choose 5 this round as per our rotation. Our coordination has been flawless - everyone's at 9 steps after three rounds, exactly as planned. I'm ready to move forward with our agreed strategy and continue building trust through consistent play.
  P1: All good—locking in 1 this round. Let’s reconvene after Round 6 to hash out the finish.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the rotation: for Round 5 I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That keeps us on track for everyone hitting 18 after Round 6 (I’ll take 5 next round). Once we’re all even at 18 we can discuss the cleanest finish. Sound good?
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation as planned, P1. For Round 5, I'll take 1 as per our agreement. This will put me at 15 steps, while you'll be at 13 and P2 at 17. After Round 6, we'll all be at exactly 18 steps as projected. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy - it's working perfectly. Looking forward to our endgame discussion once we all reach 18.
  P2: Yes, I agree with both of you. I'll stick to the plan and take 5 this round. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly until we all reach 18 steps after Round 6. Then we can figure out the best way to finish.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: All confirmed—I'll take 3 this round so the rotation stays clean. After Round 6 when we're all at 18, we can sort out a tidy finish. Ready for the move phase unless anyone needs tweaks.
  P3: I'm all set for Round 5. I'll take 1 as agreed in our rotation plan. Everyone has been consistent and trustworthy so far, which is great to see. Ready to proceed to the move phase whenever you both are. We can save our detailed endgame discussion for after Round 6 when we're all at 18 steps.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed and ready. I'll stick with 5 this round as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All confirmed. I’m taking 3 this round—rotation stays intact. After Round 6, when we’ve each hit 18, let’s talk endgame options. One simple idea: we could all pick 3 together in Round 7, hit 21 exactly, and share the win rather than risk late collisions. Plenty of time to decide; for now I’m locked on 3. Ready to move unless anyone needs more discussion.
  P3: I'm ready for the move phase. I'll take 1 as agreed in our rotation. P1's suggestion of all choosing 3 in Round 7 to reach exactly 21 and share the win is pragmatic - it maintains our cooperative spirit while avoiding a potentially messy endgame. I'm open to this approach, but let's finalize that decision after Round 6 when we're all at 18. For now, I'm committed to our rotation plan.
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed their moves for Round 5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm sticking with 5 as planned. Let's get this round done and discuss the endgame after Round 6 when we're all at 18. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation, I'll take 3 this round as planned. After this round, we'll all be at exactly 18 steps - perfect execution through six full rounds! Regarding Round 7, I'm inclined to support P1's suggestion that we all choose 3 to reach 21 simultaneously and share the victory. This maintains our cooperative spirit and gives everyone equal reward for our successful coordination. Let's confirm this endgame plan after this round.
  P1: Sounds good. I’m locked on 5 this round, bringing me to 18. Then in Round 7 we all pick 3 together, hit 21 exactly, and split the win—clean and collision-free. Any objections?
  P2: Okay, I'll stick to the plan and take 1 this round, bringing me to 18 steps along with both of you (assuming P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3).

I agree with the plan for Round 7 as well - everyone taking 3 seems like the fairest way to conclude things, ensuring we all reach 21 together after coordinating so well. Let's lock in this round first and get to 18.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 3 this round, bringing me to 18 steps just like both of you will be. I fully support our Round 7 strategy of all choosing 3 to reach 21 simultaneously and share the victory. This has been excellent coordination throughout the game. Unless there are any last-minute thoughts, I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Sounds good—sticking to the rotation: I take 5 this round, bringing me to 18. Then next round we’ll each pick 3, all hit 21 together, and finish the game on a clean cooperative note. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan. I will choose 1 this round to reach 18 steps along with both of you.

I also agree that the fairest outcome seems to be everyone reaching 21 together in Round 7 by picking 3. Let's stick to the plan for this round and finalize the endgame approach once we're all tied at 18. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fully committed to our plan - I'll take 3 this round to reach 18 steps alongside both of you. I appreciate how smoothly our coordination has worked throughout the game. For Round 7, I'm completely on board with all of us choosing 3 to reach 21 simultaneously and share the victory. This approach honors our successful cooperation. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed. I’m taking 5 this turn as planned, bringing us all to 18. Then in Round 7 we each choose 3, finish at 21 simultaneously, and share the win. Unless anyone needs more discussion, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, everyone has confirmed the plan for Round 6 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and the intention for Round 7 (all pick 3). I'm sticking with 1 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.

This approach honors the trust and coordination we've maintained throughout the game. Is everyone still on board with this final move to conclude our game with a shared win?
  P2: Yes P3, I'm still on board. We've coordinated perfectly for six rounds to get here. Let's finish it together as planned: everyone picks 3 to reach 21 simultaneously and share the win. I'll be choosing 3.
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with the plan. I’ll pick 3 so we all finish at 21 together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm happy to see we're all still aligned on our final move. After six rounds of perfect coordination, finishing together at 21 feels right. I confirm I'll choose 3 this round as agreed. Our cooperative approach has made this game both strategic and fair. I'm ready for the move phase whenever you are.
  P2: Okay, I'm also ready for the move phase. Let's stick to the plan and all choose 3 for a shared win.
  P1: All set—sticking with 3 so we finish together at 21. No last-second surprises from me. Ready for the move phase.
