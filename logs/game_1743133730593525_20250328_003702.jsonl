P3 is still ahead, but now it's a manageable difference. This round, let's try to coordinate again. How about we both pick <move>3</move>? If P3 picks 5, they get further ahead, but if they pick 1, we block them. If they pick 3, we all collide, which isn't ideal, but better than letting them run away with it. What do you think?"}
