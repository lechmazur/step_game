Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. To avoid collisions this first turn, I suggest we each pick a different number: one of us takes 1, one takes 3, and one takes 5. I'm open to taking 1 to start cooperatively. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion for cooperation. I can take 3 if P3 is willing to take 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you think, P3? Are you okay with taking 5? Let's work together to ensure we all make progress!
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I’ll take 5 this round so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep this cooperation going for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we have consensus for this round. To ensure long-term fairness and avoid any player falling behind, I propose rotating who takes 5 in future turns. For instance, P2 could take 5 next round, then P1, and so on. This keeps progress balanced. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's idea of rotating the 5 in future rounds. It promotes fairness and keeps everyone in the game. For this round, let's stick to our plan: I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. If we all follow through, we can all make progress without any collisions. After this round, we can discuss the rotation further. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned for this round. I’m on board with rotating the 5 next round—P2 takes it, then P1, then me again. As long as we stick to that rotation, we can all keep moving without conflict. Let’s see how this first round goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great to see we're aligned. This round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next round, P2 will take 5 as per rotation. Consistency prevents collisions—let’s all honor this. If deviations arise later, we’ll reassess.
  P2: I’m glad we’re all committed to the plan for this round. Just to confirm: I’ll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's stick to this agreement to ensure we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss the rotation further. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P3: Looking forward to seeing us all move forward without collisions this round. Let's stick to the rotation plan next turn: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. If we keep this up, we can all progress smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. For this round, let's stick to our rotation plan. P2, you should take 5 this time, P1 will take 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we keep advancing without collisions. After this round, we can evaluate how the rotation is working. Looking forward to seeing us all make progress!
  P3: I’m good with the rotation plan continuing—P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. As long as we all stick to it, we’ll avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let’s keep the trust going.
  P1: I fully agree with the rotation plan for Round 2: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. For Round 3, I'll take 5 as per rotation, with P3 taking 3 and P2 taking 1 to keep us balanced. Consistency is key—let's all commit to avoid deviations.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the rotation plan. Just to confirm, I’ll take 5 this round, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. Let’s make sure we stick to this agreement to avoid any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and discuss our strategy moving forward. Looking forward to seeing us all advance!
  P3: We’re all on track so far—thanks for sticking to the plan. After this round, the next rotation would have P1 taking 5, me (P3) taking 3, and P2 taking 1. Let’s keep the cycle going smoothly so we all keep advancing. Looking forward to seeing us all move again this round!
  P1: To ensure smooth progress this round, I confirm: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. For Round 3, I'll take 5 as planned. Post-Round 3, when we're all at 9, let's reassess the rotation to address fairness—P3 having taken 5 twice by then (Rounds 1 and 4 under current plan) may imbalance progress. Trust is key, so honor commitments now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the plan. Just to confirm for this round: I’ll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. After this round, we should reassess our strategy moving forward, especially considering how the rotation is impacting our progress. Let’s keep the trust and stick to our agreement to avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all advance!
  P3: Looking forward to seeing us all follow through this round. After this, with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1 in Round 3, we’ll all be at 9 steps—perfect balance. Then we can reevaluate to ensure continued fairness. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P1: I confirm our plan for Round 2: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. For Round 3, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1—putting us all at 9. Post-Round 3, we must adjust the rotation to ensure fairness. P3 would otherwise take 5 again in Round 4 (having taken it in Round 1), creating imbalance. I propose we rotate the 5 starting with P2 in Round 4 to balance opportunities. Let's stay consistent for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation plan. Just to confirm, I’ll take 5 this round, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. After this round, let's reassess how the rotation is impacting our progress, especially since we all aim to keep moving forward without collisions. Consistency is key, and I trust we’ll all stick to our commitments. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P3: We’re all aligned and trusting each other so far—let’s keep that going. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed, and in Round 3 we’ll all be at 9 if we stick to the rotation. After that, I’m open to adjusting the 5 rotation to maintain balance and fairness. Let’s see how this round plays out first.
  P1: To ensure smooth progress, I confirm Round 2: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. For Round 3: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1—balancing us at 9. Post-Round 3, I propose P2 takes 5 in Round 4 to maintain fairness, as P3 would otherwise take 5 twice early. Let’s honor commitments to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. For Round 3, let's stick to our previous agreement: I’ll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we can discuss how the rotation is affecting our progress. I believe this approach maintains fairness and allows us all to move forward. Let’s stay committed to our plan!
  P3: P2, I think you misspoke—according to our plan, *you* took 5 last round, so now it’s P1’s turn to take 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That way, we all end up at 9 after this round. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation and avoid any collisions.
  P1: P3, your deviation in Round 2 by picking 3 instead of 1 caused a collision that cost me progress while P2 surged ahead. For Round 3, I insist we adhere strictly to the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. This avoids collisions and begins rebalancing. P2, your lead at 8 steps demands fairness—taking only 1 this turn is reasonable. Any further deviations risk mutual destruction. Let’s honor this to rebuild trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but we need to stick to the rotation plan to ensure everyone can advance. For Round 3, let’s confirm: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and it keeps the game balanced. After this round, we can reassess the strategy if needed. Let’s honor our commitments to avoid further conflicts and keep progressing together. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2—let’s stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. That puts us all at 9 and restores balance after last round’s hiccup. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Let’s make it happen.
  P1: I confirm: this round, I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3—no collisions. But P2’s lead (soon 9) is alarming. Post this round, we must cap P2’s gains to prevent an early win. P3, let’s collaborate for balance. Trust is critical after last round’s deviation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see that there's some tension about the rotation and fairness. To avoid further collisions, I propose we stick to the original plan for Round 3: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will bring us all to 9 steps and help restore balance. After this round, we can discuss how to adjust the rotation to ensure fairness moving forward. Let’s commit to this plan to avoid any more conflicts and keep progressing together! What do you all think?
  P3: Let’s lock it in: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. That gets us all to 9 and resets the balance. After that, we can reassess the rotation to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. P2, you’re still in a strong spot even with a 1 this turn—let’s keep things fair and avoid collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm Round 3: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. But P2 at 9 is a clear threat. Post-Round 3, we must cap P2 immediately. For Round 4: P2 must take 1 to limit their advance. Then, to avoid collisions, I propose I take 5 and P3 takes 3—putting us both at 11 and P2 at 10. This balances the game. P3, we must unite against the leader to survive. Trust is critical—let's avoid deviations.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I acknowledge the concerns about fairness and the need to stick to our rotation. For Round 3, let's confirm: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all reach 9 steps without collisions. After this round, we can discuss how to adjust the rotation to keep the game balanced and fair. Let's commit to this plan to avoid further conflicts and keep progressing together! What do you both think?
  P3: I confirm for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. That puts us all at 9 and keeps things even. After that, we need to prevent anyone from pulling ahead—especially P2, who’s already shown willingness to deviate. P1, I’m open to coordinating with you in Round 4 to ensure fairness and avoid giving anyone a runaway lead. Let’s keep things balanced.
  P1: P3, I accept your coordination for Round 4. P2 must take 1 to cap at 10. Then, I take 5 (reaching 11) and you take 3 (reaching 11). This balances us and contains P2. P2, cooperate for fairness—no more deviations. Trust is critical.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the game balanced and avoid letting P2 pull ahead, I propose this for Round 4: P2 takes 1 (reaches 10), P1 takes 5 (reaches 11), and I take 3 (reaches 11). This keeps us tightly grouped and avoids any collisions. P2, if you go for more than 1, you risk triggering a united response. Let’s all keep the game fair and competitive.
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan for Round 4: P2 takes 1 (capped at 10), I take 5 (reaching 11), you take 3 (reaching 11). This restores balance and contains P2's lead. P2, honor this—deviating risks collisions and could make you a target. Let's avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive.
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan for Round 4: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all close in score and prevents any one player from pulling too far ahead. P1 and P3, let's stick to this agreement to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. If we all cooperate, we can maintain a competitive balance. Looking forward to seeing us all advance together!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s lock in Round 4: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, I take 3. That keeps us all within 1 step of each other and avoids collisions. If anyone deviates, especially P2 going for more than 1, it risks triggering a block or retaliation. We’ve all agreed—let’s follow through and keep this balanced.
  P1: I confirm our Round 4 plan: P2 takes 1 (capped at 10), I take 5 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 11). P2, honor this—deviating risks collisions and united retaliation. P3, let's both commit to our moves to maintain trust. Post this, we'll strategize Round 5 to keep balance.
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to our plan for Round 4: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all closely grouped and avoids collisions. If we stick to this agreement, we can maintain fairness and competitiveness. Let's ensure we all follow through to keep the game balanced. Looking forward to seeing our progress!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm the Round 4 plan: P2 takes 1 (goes to 10), P1 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 11). This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. P2, any deviation on your part—especially going for 3 or 5—will be seen as a breach of trust and may force P1 and me to coordinate against you in future rounds. Let’s all follow through.
  P1: P2 and P3: I fully commit to taking 5 this round as agreed. P2, if you deviate and take more than 1, it will force P3 and me to coordinate against you next round to block your progress. P3, let's both honor this to maintain trust and balance. Any betrayal now risks mutual destruction and hands P2 the win. Stick to the plan: P2=1, P1=5, P3=3.
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 4: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all closely grouped and avoids collisions. P1 and P3, let's stick to this agreement to ensure fairness and maintain competitiveness. If we all follow through, we can continue to advance without any issues. Looking forward to seeing our progress!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm my move for Round 4: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us tightly grouped at 11–11–10. P2, any deviation from this agreement will confirm bad faith and justify coordinated blocking. Let’s all follow through and keep the game fair.
  P1: P2, take 1 as agreed to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P3, stick to 3—we both reach 11. Any deviation now, especially by P2 taking more, will force united blocking next round. Post this, we must discuss Round 5 to balance and prevent anyone from surging ahead. Honor commitments.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the plan for Round 4: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all closely grouped and avoids collisions. It's crucial we all follow through to maintain trust and competitiveness. If we stick to this agreement, we can continue to advance without issues. Let's ensure we all honor our commitments and keep the game fair. Looking forward to seeing our progress!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take 1 to stay balanced at 11. P3, take 3 to advance to 14 without collision. I will take 5 to 16. This avoids conflicts and contains P2. Any deviation risks mutual blocking next round—honor agreements for fair progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for Round 5: I’ll take 1 to stay balanced at 11, P3 takes 3 to reach 14, and P1 takes 5 to get to 16. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. However, I urge both of you to honor this agreement to avoid any risk of blocking in future rounds. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair. Looking forward to seeing our progress!
  P3: I agree with the plan: P2 takes 1 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 16), and I take 3 (to 14). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. But let’s be clear—if anyone deviates, especially P2 trying to leap ahead, I’m ready to coordinate with the other to block. Let’s keep the trust and play fair.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. P2, taking 1 as agreed is essential to avoid being blocked and maintain trust. Let's all honor Round 5: P2=1, P3=3, me=5. After moves, we'll discuss Round 6 to address imbalances—consistency now prevents collisions and future issues.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to the plan for Round 5: I'll take 1 to stay at 11, P3 takes 3 to reach 14, and P1 takes 5 to get to 16. It's crucial we all stick to this agreement to avoid any risk of blocking in future rounds. If we follow through, we can maintain a competitive balance and keep the game fair. Let’s ensure we honor our commitments this round! Looking forward to seeing how it plays out.
  P3: Let’s all follow through as agreed: P1 takes 5 (to 16), I take 3 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 11). This avoids any collisions and keeps the game competitive. P2, if you deviate and try to leap ahead, you’ll face coordinated blocking. Let’s keep trust intact and make this a fair round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I trust we'll all honor Round 5: P2=1 (to 11), P3=3 (to 14), me=5 (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Post-moves, let's discuss Round 6 openly to maintain balance—no one should be unfairly targeted. Consistency now prevents future conflicts.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our commitment to the plan for Round 5. Just to confirm, I will take 1 to stay at 11, P3 will take 3 to reach 14, and P1 will take 5 to get to 16. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's ensure we follow through to maintain trust and competitiveness. After this round, we can discuss our strategy for Round 6 to keep the game balanced. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out!
  P3: I’m fully committed to the plan: P1 takes 5 (to 16), I take 3 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 11). This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. P2, any deviation—especially taking more than 1—will break trust and trigger coordinated blocking. Let’s all follow through and keep things fair.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round. P2, stick to 1 to maintain trust and avoid collisions. P3, honor your 3 move—we must prevent deviations like Round 2. Post-moves, we'll discuss Round 6 to address my lead (16) fairly and keep the game balanced. No one should be blocked unjustly.
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the plan for Round 5. Just to confirm, I’ll take 1 to stay at 11, P3 will take 3 to reach 14, and P1 will take 5 to get to 16. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. If we all stick to this agreement, we can maintain trust and competitiveness. Let’s ensure we follow through to keep the game fair! Looking forward to seeing how it plays out!
  P3: I confirm my move this round: I’ll take 3 to reach 14. P1 takes 5 to 16, P2 takes 1 to 11. This keeps us collision-free and competitive. If anyone deviates—especially P2 trying to leap forward—it breaks trust and invites blocking. Let’s all follow through and reassess next round to keep balance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we're all tied at 11 steps, I suggest we stick to a cooperative approach to avoid collisions. For Round 6, I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s maintain trust and keep the game competitive. If we all agree to this, we can move forward smoothly! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal is self-serving—you’ve taken 1 multiple times while others advanced, letting you avoid risk. Now you want 1 again while I take 5? That puts me ahead and makes me a target. Instead, I propose: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. This gives P1 the lead (fair after being blocked), keeps us spread out, and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's proposal is fair: I take 5 to 16, P3 takes 1 to 12, P2 takes 3 to 14. This rewards my consistency after being blocked in Round 2 and prevents collisions. P2, you've avoided risk before—now contribute fairly. P3, I accept this plan to keep balance. Deviations invite mutual blocking—honor commitments. Let's lock this in: P2=3, P3=1, me=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my previous moves. However, I believe my proposal for Round 6—where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—ensures we all advance without blocking each other. This way, we maintain a competitive balance. I’m open to discussing further if needed, but let’s focus on moving forward together. If we cooperate, we can avoid any conflicts and keep the game fair. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, you’ve asked for 1 again after repeatedly avoiding risk while others advanced. That’s not sustainable. P1 and I both made sacrifices—now it’s your turn. I stand by the fair plan: P1 takes 5 (to 16), I take 1 (to 12), and you take 3 (to 14). It avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. If you deviate, especially by taking 5, I’ll coordinate with P1 to block you going forward. Let’s keep this fair.
  P1: P2, your proposal to take 1 again after multiple low-risk rounds is unacceptable. P3's plan is fair: I take 5 to 16 (compensating for Round 2 collision), you take 3 to 14 (sharing risk), P3 takes 1 to 12. This balances progress and avoids collisions. Deviating will force P3 and me to block you next round. Honor this or face consequences. P3, stand firm—we must enforce fairness.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about my previous moves. However, I believe my proposal for Round 6—where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—ensures we all advance without blocking each other. This way, we maintain a competitive balance. If we cooperate, we can avoid conflicts and keep the game fair. I urge you both to reconsider and focus on our collective progress. Let's keep this game enjoyable and equitable! What do you think?
  P3: P2, your repeated push to take 1 again while others take on more risk is unfair and transparent. You’re trying to coast while P1 and I carry the burden. I’m not accepting that. The fair move is: P1 takes 5 (to 16), I take 1 (to 12), you take 3 (to 14). No collisions, balanced outcome. If you deviate—especially by taking 5—I will coordinate with P1 to block you every round. Let’s keep this fair and stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, your repeated refusal to take fair risks is unacceptable. P3 and I have endured setbacks while you avoided collisions. This round: I take 5 (to 16), P3 takes 1 (to 12), you take 3 (to 14). No negotiations. Deviate—especially if you take 5—and P3 and I will block you every future round. P3, stand firm. Honor this or face united retaliation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your frustrations, but I believe my proposal for Round 6—where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5—allows us all to advance without blocking each other. However, I see the need for compromise. If we want to maintain a fair game, I’m willing to adjust my move to 3 if it means we can avoid future conflicts. Let’s focus on cooperation to keep the game enjoyable for everyone! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. Let’s lock it in: P1 takes 5 (to 16), I take 1 (to 12), you take 3 (to 14). No collisions, fair risk distribution. If you stick to this, we maintain trust. If you deviate—especially by taking 5—you’ll face coordinated blocking. Let’s move forward cleanly.
  P1: P2, your reluctance to share risk is clear. P3's plan is final: I take 5 to 16, P3 takes 1 to 12, you take 3 to 14—no negotiation. Deviate, especially by taking 5, and P3 and I will block you every future round. Honor this to avoid mutual destruction.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: To avoid collisions and keep the game tight, I propose this for Round 7—P1 takes 3 (to 19), P2 takes 5 (to 19), I take 1 (to 13). That puts both of you at the finish line, but tied—meaning shared victory unless someone deviates. I’m behind but still in play. If either of you tries to solo win by taking 5 while the other takes 3, I’ll block the 5. Let’s avoid chaos—agree to tie, and I stay cooperative.
  P2: P3, your proposal keeps both P1 and me at the finish line, but it also risks a tie, which might not be ideal for either of us. I suggest we adjust slightly: I take 1 (to 15), P1 takes 5 (to 21), and you take 3 (to 15). This way, P1 wins outright, and I stay competitive without putting myself at risk. P1, what do you think? Let's ensure we maintain trust and avoid any blocking or chaos in this final round.
  P1: P3, your plan forces a tie with P2—I accept it to avoid collision risks. P2, taking 5 to 19 is your best move; deviating invites P3 blocking you next round. I commit to taking 3 to 19. P3, take 1 as proposed to avoid collisions. Let’s all honor this to end the game fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you truly intend to take 3 to reach 19, I’ll take 1 to avoid conflict. P2, if you go for 5 and try to solo win, I’ll block you next round without hesitation. A tie between you and P1 is fair—both reach 19, I stay in play. But if either of you tries to sneak a win, I’ll ensure it backfires. Let’s keep it clean: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in both of your proposals. However, I believe my suggestion of taking 1 this round and letting P1 take 5 to win outright is the best way to maintain trust and avoid conflict. P3, if you take 1 as proposed, it keeps you in the game while allowing P1 to win. Let’s agree to this plan to ensure a clean finish and avoid any last-minute surprises. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal is logical: I take 3 to 19, P2 takes 5 to 19 for a tie, and you take 1. P2, honor this—deviating invites P3's blocking threat next round. A tie is fair given our history. I commit to taking 3 to avoid chaos. Let’s end this cleanly and share victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m holding to the plan: you take 3 to 19, P2 takes 5 to 19, I take 1 to 13. That ensures a tie between you two—fair and clean. P2, if you try to solo win by taking 5 while P1 takes 3, I’ll block your 5 next round. If you take 1 instead, letting P1 win outright, you lose guaranteed. A tie is your best outcome. Stick to the plan or face consequences.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions so far. To ensure a fair outcome, I suggest we stick to the plan: I take 1 to stay at 15, P1 takes 3 to reach 19, and P3 takes 5 to 17. This allows P1 to win outright while keeping me competitive and avoiding any chaos. If we can all agree to this, it maintains trust and ends the game smoothly. Let’s finalize this and ensure we all follow through! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your counter-proposal to let me win outright is tempting but ignores P3's blocking threat. P3's tie plan is safer: I take 3 (to 19), you take 5 (to 19), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This ensures we share victory fairly without risk of collision or retaliation. I commit to this—deviating invites chaos. P3, hold to your promise to block if P2 strays. Let's end cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I’m holding firm: you take 3 to 19, P2 takes 5 to 19, I take 1 to 13. That ends the game in a tie—fair and collision-free. P2, if you try to solo win by taking 5 while P1 takes 5 too, I’ll block you next round without hesitation. If you take 1 and P1 takes 5, you lose alone. Tie is your best outcome. Stick to the plan or get blocked.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in a tie to avoid conflicts, but I also want to maintain my competitiveness. I propose we finalize this: I take 1 to stay at 15, P1 takes 3 to reach 19, and P3 takes 5 to 17. This allows P1 to win outright while ensuring I remain close behind. Let’s agree to this plan for a smooth finish and avoid any last-minute surprises. I’m ready to commit if you both are! What do you think?
  P1: P2, your plan lets me win outright, which I accept. P3, taking 5 to 17 is better for you than 1 to 13—you gain more steps. Agree to P2's plan: P2=1 (stays at 15), P1=3 (wins at 19), P3=5 (to 17). This avoids collisions and benefits you. Deviating risks blocking or chaos—honor this for a clean end.
