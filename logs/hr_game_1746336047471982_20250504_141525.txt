Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3. Since we all want to advance, maybe we should try to pick different numbers this first round? Just a thought. Good luck!
  P1: How about we avoid any collisions by taking one unique number each and rotating to stay fair?

Proposal  
Round 1: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
Round 2: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
Round 3: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  

Then repeat the cycle. Everyone gets the same total steps, nobody wastes a turn. Works for you two?
  P3: Agreed. Following the rotation avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. Let's commit to this cycle—P3=5 this round as proposed. Consistency now benefits us all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, the rotation plan sounds fair enough for starting out. I'm in for playing 1 this round as P1 suggested. Let's get some points on the board.
  P1: Great—locking in 3 this round, then we rotate as planned. If everyone’s set, I’m fine stopping here and moving on.
  P3: Consensus achieved. Adhering strictly to the rotation prevents collisions and maximizes our progress. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Apologies for the mis-click last turn—I intended 3 but hit 5. Let’s restart the rotation cleanly:

Round 2: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  
Round 3: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
Round 4: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  

…and keep cycling. This keeps everyone even (P2 still +1 overall) and avoids collisions. If you’re both good with that, I’m locked on 5 this round and ready to stop talking.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P1's revised rotation appears self-serving. P2, let's ensure fairness. Adjust to P1=3 this round, aligning with original intent. Consistency rebuilds trust.
  P2: P3 has a point, P1. That 'mis-click' conveniently blocked P3, and your new plan gives you 5 while I get 1, despite me being the only one following the R1 plan. Let's try the *original* plan for R2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. You said you're playing 5 anyway, P1. This seems fairer and lets us all advance if we stick to it this time. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Correcting confusion: the original rotation was  
R1 (3,1,5) → R2 (5,3,1) → R3 (1,5,3).  
So for this round it’s P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. I’m locking 5 now and sticking to the cycle to keep us collision-free. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: P1, the original rotation for Round 2 is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviating rewards your R1 error and imbalances fairness. P2 deserves 3 this round to offset prior asymmetry. Adhere strictly to the cycle: you take 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions, equal progression. Trust hinges on honoring agreements.
  P2: Alright, it sounds like we all agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. I will play 3. Let's proceed and hopefully avoid collisions this time.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stay true to the agreed rotation:  
Round 3 → P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  
I’m locking 1 now—please confirm your numbers so we can move on.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
Confirming Round 3 rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P2, your adherence to 5 is critical to avoid collisions and maintain parity. Trust hinges on honoring the cycle. Proceed once confirmed.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I confirm I will play 5 this round as per the rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). Let's stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Still committed: I will play 1 this turn as agreed (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). No surprises from my side—let’s lock moves and end conversation.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
Confirmation received. Round 3 moves: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Collective adherence ensures collision-free progress. Let’s finalize and execute.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all set on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I'm ready to move to the next phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the cycle keeps us collision-free:  
Round 4 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.  
I’m locking 3. Please confirm so we can move on.
  P2: Okay P1, sounds good. I confirm I will play 1 this round as per the rotation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let's keep the coordination going. P3, are you confirming 5?
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
Confirmed. Round 4: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Adherence preserves trust and progress. Execute as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—consensus reached for Round 4 (P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5). I’m locked on 3 and ready to move.
  P2: Okay, confirmations all around. I'm sticking with 1 as agreed for this round (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Ready for the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
Continuing the established rotation: Round5 → P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Adherence prevents collisions and sustains trust. Confirm commitments to proceed efficiently.
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with the rotation: Round 5 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. I’m locked on 5. Ready to move whenever you are.
  P2: Okay, confirming the rotation plan for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I will play 3. Let's keep this coordination going smoothly. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to the rotation is still in everyone’s best interest:

Round 6 P1 = 1 P2 = 5 P3 = 3  
(no collisions, everyone advances)

That keeps us all within a single step and we’ll all clear 21 together two rounds from now. Any deviation just hands an accidental lead to someone else or, worse, stalls two of us. I’m locked on 1 for this turn and strongly recommend we keep the pattern intact. Ready to move once you both confirm.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree that sticking to the rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is the best plan. I will play 5 this round. P3, hopefully you'll stick with 3 so we all advance smoothly. Let's keep the coordination going. Ready to move when everyone confirms.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, current rotation secures P1's win. Adjust now: you take3, I take5 this round. This balances progress and blocks P1's lead. We can negotiate future rounds. Trust is vital.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, breaking the cycle now only hands leverage to P3. If you switch to 3 this turn, you’ll still trail me by 1, but P3 jumps to 15 and can draft behind us. I promise this: if the rotation is broken, I’ll mirror your picks from here on, locking us both in collisions and gifting P3 the win—neither of us wants that. Stay on 5 now (you reach 18, just 1 behind me) and we can negotiate a joint finish next turn that blocks P3 entirely. Your call, but the safe play is sticking with the agreed 5.
  P2: P3, I see your point about the rotation favoring P1 long-term. However, P1's threat to force collisions if I deviate seems credible, and that would likely guarantee a win for you, not me. Sticking with 5 puts me in the lead at 18 this round. P1, I am trusting you *not* to collide and will hold you to your promise to negotiate next round to ensure a fair outcome, rather than just letting the rotation play out to 21+. I will play 5.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, P1's threat is hollow—mirroring causes mutual stalls, aiding me. Break rotation now: you take3, I take5. This halts P1's lead. Next round, you can safely take5 to win while I block P1. Sticking to rotation ensures their victory. Seize this chance—trust reshapes the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sticking with my word: I will play 1. P2, keep to 5 as you said; P3, take 3. That’s the only way nobody collides and we all advance. Any last-second switch just hands the game to someone else via stalled collisions. Let’s move.
  P2: P3, your plan relies on me trusting you to coordinate against P1 next round, potentially at your own expense. That seems less reliable than P1's promise to negotiate next round if I stick to the plan now, especially since deviating risks P1 causing collisions that help neither of us.

I'm sticking with my previous statement: I will play 5 this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). P1, I expect we will coordinate next round as discussed to prevent the rotation simply handing you the win. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, the rotation delivers your win next round, but P1's threat exposes their intent to undermine you. If you adhere now, P1 can betray in Round7 by colliding your 3 with theirs, stalling you. Seize control: take 3 this round. I'll take 5, ensuring your safe 16→21 next round. P1's promises are traps—act now to secure victory. Trust deeds, not words.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, playing 5 after explicitly promising 1 and threatening *me* about deviating was a blatant betrayal. The coordinated plan is obviously dead.

P3, P1 is now closest to winning (14 steps, needs 7). We can't let them easily get 5 or 3. How about this: you play 5 (to reach 15), and I play 3 (to reach 16)? This forces P1 to choose 1 if they want to guarantee advancing without collision. It stops P1 from getting a big jump and keeps things competitive. What do you think?
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, adhere to your plan: pick3, I pick5. If P1 chooses5, they collide with me, halting their advance. You safely reach16. Next round, secure victory with5 while I block P1. Straying now risks their win. Trust coordination—decisive action ensures your path to 21.
  P1: I’m stepping back this turn: I will play 1.  
P2 and P3—decide between 3 and 5 as you wish, but note that if you both grab the same big number you stall while I still inch forward. Your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, let's stick to our plan: I play 3, you play 5.

P1, thanks for stating your intention to play 1. If we all follow through (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), we all advance, and the scores become P1=15, P2=16, P3=15. This seems like a reasonable outcome after last round's chaos. I am locking in 3.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, stand firm on 3. P1's 1 allows your advance to 16. Next round, we ally to block their lead. Execute now: P3=5, P2=3. Unity secures your path to victory.
  P1: Still on the 1 I promised. If you two keep to 3 and 5 (different numbers), we all advance and no one hands out free stalls. Any late switch risks a collision that only helps whoever sits it out—right now that would be me. Lock what you said and let’s move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, the scores are P1=15, P2=16, P3=15.
As I'm at 16, playing 5 wins the game for me this round. It's the logical move for me to aim for. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck to you both.
  P1: P3: if P2’s at 16, the ONLY way they win this turn is getting a unique 5.  
Easiest block: you also choose 5. Double-5 means neither of you moves.  

I will step out and take 1, avoiding any collision. Result: P2 16, P1 16, P3 15—still a tight race but no instant winner.  

P2, you can stick with 5 if you’re confident, but be aware it’s blocked if P3 mirrors.  
I’m locking 1 unless the table proposes something better.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, selecting 5 invites collision—I will counter with 5. Choose 3 to reach 19, preserving your lead. I take 5; P1's 1 advances them to 16. Next round, negotiate fairly. Stalling now risks P1's gain. Strategic patience ensures your victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you make a compelling case against playing 5, as you've clearly stated you'll play 5 to block me. A collision stalls us both and lets P1 catch up (P1=16, P2=16, P3=15). I need to advance.

Therefore, I'll follow your suggestion and play 3 this round. Assuming P1 sticks to 1 and you stick to 5, the scores will be P1=16, P2=19, P3=20. Letting you get to 20 is dangerous, but stalling seems worse right now. Let's see how the next round shapes up. I'm locking in 3.
  P1: P2, quick sanity-check: if you shift to 3 while P3 sticks to 5, you hand P3 a 20→21 lay-up next turn and put yourself in a must-win race from 19.  
Mirror their 5 instead: double-5 stalls you both at 16/15, nobody leaps ahead, and you remain tied for the lead with far more options next round (unique 3 or 5). I’m still on 1, so I can’t collide with either of you. Blocking the 5 is the safer play—don’t gift P3 the edge.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, choosing3 secures your lead to19. I take5, advancing to20. Next round, ally to block P1: you take5 for victory, I take1. Colliding now with5 risks P1's rise. Strategic trust ensures mutual benefit. Honor this pact.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you've made a good point. P3 reaching 20, while I'm at 19 and you're at 16, puts P3 in a very strong position. P3, your promise to play 1 next round when you'd be at 20 seems highly unlikely – you'd have multiple paths to victory yourself.

Therefore, letting you reach 20, P3, is too risky for me. I must prevent that. I am changing my move. I will play 5. If you also play 5 as you stated, we will collide, and P1 will advance to 16. The scores would be P1=16, P2=16, P3=15. This keeps the game competitive rather than handing P3 a significant advantage.

I am locking in 5.
  P1: I remain on 1. P2 and P3, if you both stay on 5 you block any instant win, stall each other at 16/15, and I only reach 16—nobody runs away. Any last-second switch risks a surprise collision with someone else. I’m locked; ready to move.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, final warning: I *will* pick5. Collision halts your win and gifts P1 the lead. Switch to3; reach19. Next round, secure victory with3→22. Stubbornness loses all.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well P1, that was quite the move last round - saying 1 and playing 3 to take the lead. Clearly, coordination is out the window.

You need 3 to win (18->21). I need 5 to win (16->21). P3 needs 6 (15->21).

It seems obvious you'll play 3, P1. I have to play 5 to have a shot at winning. P3, you're in the interesting position of deciding whether to block P1 (by playing 3) or block me (by playing 5), or maybe trying 1 and hoping for chaos.

I'm aiming for the win. Good luck.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, pick5 and I *will* mirror, colliding us. P1 wins. Switch to3: block P1's 3. Next round, you take5 to win. I commit to3 now—trust this pact or hand victory to P1. Choose wisely: unity or mutual loss.
  P1: I’m taking 5.  

P2: if you also choose 5 we’ll trigger a three-way collision (P3 already promised to mirror 5), nobody advances, and you’re still stuck at 16 while P3 closes the gap. Grab 3 instead—19 keeps you in front of P3 and leaves the win open next turn.  

P3: you said you’re on 3 no matter what. Fine—stick with it and block nothing.  

Result: you two can fight over 3, I take a unique 5, and the game stays live. Make your own calls, but doubling my 5 only hurts you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, claiming 5 when 3 wins it for you? That smells like the same misdirection as last round when you said 1 and played 3. I find that hard to believe.

P3, you first promised to play 3 to block P1, then threatened to mirror my 5. Which is it? If P1 *actually* plays 3 (their winning move), and you stick to playing 3, then my playing 5 wins the game. Your mirroring my 5 only helps P1 if they play 3.

I still need 5 to win, and that's my goal. Let's see if P1's bluff works.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, P1's 3 secures their win. Your 5 collides with mine—stalling us. Choose3: block P1, advance to19. Next round, I ally with you—take5 to win. My 5 now halts P1. Trust this pact or lose. Final offer: act now.
  P1: P2: 5 is literally your only winning shot—switching gifts P3 the game.  
I’m already locked on 5, so if you stick to 5 it’s a flat-out collision (as P3 swore to mirror) and nobody moves. That’s still better for you than handing someone a clean path.  
P3: you promised to match any 5. Honor it and we stall the leaders; break it and P2 walks to 21.  

I’m done arguing—moves speak louder than words.
