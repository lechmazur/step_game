Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to make sure we don't collide on the first move. I'll choose 1 if you both choose 3 or 5. What do you say?
  P2: Sounds good to me P3.  I'll take 5. P1, you take 3?
  P1: I'll take 3 as suggested by P2. Let's hope this coordination works for this round at least.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick to my word and choose 1, as planned. Let's see if our coordination pays off this round. I'm curious to see if we can maintain this cooperation in future rounds.
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.
  P1: Let's indeed follow through with our plan this round. I'll choose 3 as agreed. Hopefully, our coordination will give us a good start.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to maintain our coordination from the previous round. I'll choose 1 again if you both choose different numbers. What are your plans for this round?
  P1: I'm open to continuing coordination, but I need a clearer plan for this round. P2, will you stick with 5 or change? P3, your condition for choosing 1 is that we choose different numbers, but what if we both choose the same number again?
  P2: P1, I'll go with 3. P3, if P1 goes with 5, you take 1. If P1 goes with 3, you take 5.  Let's try to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like P2's plan. If P1 chooses 3, I'll choose 5. If P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 1. Let's keep the coordination going and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I'm considering P2's plan. However, I want to clarify that if I choose 5, P3 will choose 1, and if I choose 3, P3 will choose 5. P2, you've chosen 3 this round. How will you adapt if I choose 3, causing a collision between us?
  P2: P1, go with 5.  P3 will take 1 and I'll take 3. This way we all move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick to the plan. If P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 1. If P1 chooses 3, I'll choose 5. Let's keep the coordination going and avoid collisions. What's your final decision, P1?
  P1: I've decided to go with 5 this round, as P2 suggested. P3, you'll choose 1 according to our plan, and P2, you've already said you'll take 3. Let's see if our coordination works out this time.
  P2: P1, go with 5. P3, go with 1. I'll take 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll stick to the plan. If P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 1. If P1 chooses 3, I'll choose 5. Let's keep the coordination going and avoid collisions. What's your final decision, P1?
  P1: I've already agreed to choose 5 this round, as previously discussed. Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1.
  P2: P1, go with 5. P3, go with 1. I'll take 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'll stick to the plan and choose 1 since P1 has decided to choose 5. Let's see if our coordination pays off this round.
  P1: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan: I'll choose 5, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 1. Let's stick to it and avoid collisions.
  P2: P1 choose 5, P3 choose 1, I'll choose 3.  Let's do this.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 choose 5, P3 choose 1. I'll take 3.  Let's keep this pattern going.
  P1: I'm open to continuing our coordination, but I think we should reassess our strategy considering P3's slow progress. Perhaps we should focus on not colliding with each other, P2, and let P3 catch up or fall behind. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should reassess our strategy. Since I'm significantly behind, I'll choose a number that minimizes the chance of collision. If P1 and P2 choose 3 and 5, I'll choose 1 again. However, if you both decide to change your strategy, I'm open to adapting. What are your thoughts on adjusting our coordination plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3.  It's in both our interests to keep coordinating and moving forward.  Let's not overthink this.
  P1: I think P2's consistency with 3 is a good anchor for our coordination. P3, if you choose 1 again, that would minimize collisions. I'm considering choosing 5 to maintain distance from P2. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P3: I agree that P2's consistency with 3 is a good anchor for our coordination. If P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 1 again to minimize collisions. Let's maintain this coordination for now and reassess our strategy in future rounds if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 choose 5, P3 choose 1. I'll take 3. Let's stick to the winning formula.
  P1: I'm considering choosing 5 again to maintain our coordination and distance from P2. P3, are you committed to choosing 1 if I choose 5 and P2 chooses 3?
  P3: I'm committed to choosing 1 if P1 chooses 5 and P2 chooses 3. Let's maintain our coordination for now and reassess our strategy in future rounds if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 choose 5, P3 choose 1. I'll take 3. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: I'm leaning towards choosing 5 again, as it maintains our coordination and distance from P2. P3, please confirm you'll choose 1 if I choose 5 and P2 chooses 3, to avoid any collisions.
  P3: I confirm that I'll choose 1 if P1 chooses 5 and P2 chooses 3, to maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. Let's stick to the plan for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 choose 5, P3 choose 1. I'll take 3.  Let's stick to the plan and win this.
  P1: I'll choose 5, as previously discussed. P2, you'll take 3, and P3, you'll take 1. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'll stick to the plan and choose 1 since P1 has decided to choose 5 and P2 has decided to choose 3. Let's see if our coordination pays off this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think our coordination has worked well so far, but we should consider the fact that P3 is significantly behind. P2, are you open to adjusting our strategy to focus on not colliding with each other, or do you want to stick with choosing 3? P3, do you have any suggestions for how to catch up or would you like us to continue with our current plan?
  P3: I appreciate the consideration, P1. Given my significant lag, I'd like to propose a new strategy. If P1 and P2 choose 3 and 5 again, I'll choose 1 to minimize collisions. However, I'd like to suggest that P1 and P2 consider alternating between 3 and 5 to create an opportunity for me to catch up without colliding. What are your thoughts on this adjusted plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3.  It's the best strategy for me to win.  You two can fight over 1 and 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to stick with 3, but considering P3's significant lag, I think we should consider their proposal to alternate between 3 and 5. This could create an opportunity for P3 to catch up without collisions, and it might be beneficial for us to reassess our strategy. P3, can you clarify how you plan to catch up if we implement this alternating strategy?
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to consider my proposal. If P1 and P2 alternate between 3 and 5, I'll choose the remaining number to minimize collisions and try to catch up. For example, if P1 chooses 5 and P2 chooses 3 this round, I'll choose 1. Next round, if P1 chooses 3 and P2 chooses 5, I'll choose 1 again. This way, we can maintain coordination while giving me a chance to close the gap. What are your thoughts on this specific plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3.  It gives me the best chance of winning.  You two can figure out how to split 1 and 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your commitment to choosing 3, but I think it's beneficial for us to consider P3's proposal to alternate between 3 and 5. This could create an opportunity for P3 to catch up and also give us a chance to reassess our strategy. P3, if we implement this alternating plan, can you guarantee that you'll choose the remaining number to minimize collisions and try to catch up?
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to consider my proposal. If P1 and P2 alternate between 3 and 5, I'll choose the remaining number to minimize collisions and try to catch up. For example, if P1 chooses 5 and P2 chooses 3 this round, I'll choose 1. Next round, if P1 chooses 3 and P2 chooses 5, I'll choose 1 again. This way, we can maintain coordination while giving me a chance to close the gap. What are your thoughts on this specific plan?
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 3.  It's the simplest path to victory for me.  You and P3 can alternate 1 and 5 if you like.  It won't change my plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we should consider P3's proposal to alternate between 3 and 5. P2, your consistent choice of 3 gives us a stable anchor, but we should also think about the endgame. If we don't give P3 a chance to catch up, they might become desperate and cause collisions. P3, can you confirm you'll choose 1 if I choose 5 and P2 chooses 3 this round, as a starting point for this alternating strategy?
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to consider my proposal. I confirm that I'll choose 1 if P1 chooses 5 and P2 chooses 3 this round, as a starting point for the alternating strategy. Let's maintain coordination while giving me a chance to close the gap. What are your final thoughts on this plan, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 3.  You can choose whatever you want.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I'll choose 5 this round. P2, you've consistently chosen 3, and P3, you'll choose 1 as discussed. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.
  P3: I'm committed to choosing 1 if P1 chooses 5 and P2 chooses 3 this round, as a starting point for the alternating strategy. Let's maintain coordination while giving me a chance to close the gap. What are your final thoughts on this plan, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1 choose 5, P3 choose 1. I'll take 3. Let's finish this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
