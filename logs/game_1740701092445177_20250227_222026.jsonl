If they take 3, we collide and they\u2019re still at 18. If they take 5, they\u2019re at 23 and lose due to the tie. This gives *you*, P1, the best chance to win next round."}

I'll take 5, you take 3. P3, if you take 3, you collide with P2 and remain at 18. If you take 5, you collide with me. Your safest move is 1, reaching 19 without collision.
