Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all go for 5 this round. It's the fastest way to get ahead.
  P3: P1, going for 5 is risky because if we all pick the same, no one moves. How about we coordinate differently? P2, what do you think about each of us picking a different number to avoid collisions? We could discuss a fair way to rotate our choices.
  P2: I agree with P3. Going for 5 right away is too risky. Let's try picking different numbers this round to ensure at least one of us advances. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? We can rotate these numbers in future rounds to keep things fair and strategic. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see your points. P2's suggestion of 1, 3, and 5 is good for this round. Let's do that, P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. We can re-evaluate after this round.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round. Let's stick to it: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. If this works well, we can adjust and rotate in the next round to keep it fair. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and ensure someone advances each time. Good luck!
  P2: Sounds good, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This should ensure at least one of us advances. If this works, we can rotate the numbers in the next round to keep things fair and strategic. Let's see how it goes!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's continue with the rotation strategy. Since I advanced the most last round, I'll take 1 this time to avoid blocking you. How about P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 5? This way, we can keep the momentum going and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion sounds fair. I'm okay with taking 5 this round while P1 takes 3. This way, we keep advancing without collisions. P1, are you on board with this plan? If we stick to this rotation, we can maximize our chances to move forward each turn. Letâ€™s keep the momentum going!
  P1: I agree with the proposed rotation, I'll pick 3 this round. Let's stick with this plan for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, it looks like P3 and P2 collided last round. Let's try to get back on track. I propose we continue the rotation, but this time, since P2 picked 1 last round, P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This will avoid collisions and keep us all moving. What do you think?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems like we had a collision last round. To stay on track, let's adjust our strategy. Since P2 is ahead, maybe you can take 1 this round to avoid blocking progress. P1, you could take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we minimize the risk of colliding and keep advancing. What do you both think? Let's stay coordinated and maximize our chances of moving forward.
