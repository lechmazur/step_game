It's a clever counter-strategy.\n\nSince choosing 3 or 5 would cause me to collide with one of you (if you stick to your P2=5, P3=3 plan) and result in me getting 0 steps and losing, that's too risky for me.\n\nTherefore, I will stick to my original plan and take **1 step**. Reaching 21 is guaranteed, and a shared victory is better than losing. See you at 21."}
