Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to ensure at least one of us advances. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can spread out and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. I'll take 3. Let's see how it goes.
  P2: I'll take 1 as suggested. Let's see if this strategy works and we can all advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: Okay, I think we're all on the same page for this round. Let's keep it simple and stick to our agreed plan.
  P2: I'm sticking with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's see if we can all advance and continue coordinating in the next rounds. If this strategy works, we should consider similar coordination in future turns to minimize collisions and maximize our progress. Looking forward to seeing how this round goes and adjusting our strategy as needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's stick to our plan for this round. If it works, we can discuss a more dynamic strategy for the next round to keep advancing efficiently. I'm ready to move with 5 as agreed.

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's keep the rotation going. I'll take 1 this round. P1, you take 3, and P2, you take 5. This keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to keep the rotation going. It's working well so far. I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep this coordination to avoid collisions and continue making progress. If this works, we can discuss more dynamic strategies in the future. Ready to move with 3 as agreed. Let's see how this round goes.
  P2: I agree with the rotation strategy for now, but let's start thinking about introducing some unpredictability in our next moves. Perhaps we can use a simple rule like 'if the round number is odd, shift one number higher than the rotation; if even, stick to the rotation.' This could keep us coordinated while adding a layer of unpredictability. I'll take 5 this round as per the rotation. Let's discuss this idea further after this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with the rotation for this round. I'll take 1 as suggested. P2's idea about adding a rule for unpredictability is interesting, let's discuss that after this round. Let's see how this rotation goes and then we can strategize further.
  P1: I'm ready to move with 3 as agreed. P2's idea of adding a rule for unpredictability is intriguing. If we decide to implement it, we should clearly communicate the rule to avoid any confusion. Let's see how this round goes with the rotation and then we can discuss P2's idea in more detail. Let's keep the coordination strong and stay focused.
  P2: Let's stick with the rotation for this round to keep advancing smoothly. After this, we should definitely discuss P2's idea about adding unpredictability. Maybe we can agree on a simple rule for odd and even rounds to mix things up while maintaining coordination. I'm ready to move with 5 as agreed. Let's see how this round goes and then refine our strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the rotation for this round and will take 1. P2's idea about adding a rule for unpredictability is worth exploring, but let's ensure we all understand it clearly before implementing it. Let's discuss it after this round.
  P1: I'm ready to move with 3 as agreed. P2's idea of adding unpredictability is interesting, but let's make sure it's clear and agreed upon before implementing it. For now, let's focus on this round and see how it goes. If we all advance, we can discuss a more dynamic strategy in the next round. Let's keep the coordination strong and stay focused.
  P2: Let's keep the rotation for this round to ensure we all advance. After this, we should finalize the rule for adding unpredictability. I suggest we agree on shifting one number higher on odd rounds and sticking to the rotation on even rounds. This will keep us coordinated while introducing some unpredictability. Let's discuss and confirm this rule after this round. Ready to move with 5 as agreed. Let's see how this goes and refine our strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'm ready to move with 1 as agreed for this round. Let's finalize the rule for adding unpredictability after this round.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's implement the unpredictability rule starting this round. On odd rounds like this one, we shift one number higher than our agreed rotation. So, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. On even rounds, we stick to the rotation. This should keep us coordinated while adding some unpredictability. Let's see how it goes and adjust if needed. Ready to move with 1 as per the new rule.
  P3: Okay, I understand the rule. I'll take 3 this round. Let's see if this adds enough unpredictability to keep us all advancing.
  P1: I agree with P2's rule for adding unpredictability. It's a good balance between coordination and keeping things less predictable. I'll take 5 this round as per the new rule. Let's see how this works and adjust if needed. Ready to move with 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to the new rule for this round and see how it impacts our progress. If it works well, we can continue with this strategy. If not, we should discuss adjustments in the next round. Ready to move with 1 as agreed. Let's keep the communication open and adapt as needed.
