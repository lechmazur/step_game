Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s each choose a different move this turn so we all gain steps. Anyone willing to coordinate?
  P3: Sounds good to me.
  P1: Okay, I'm in. Let's all pick different numbers.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s assign moves clearly: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 5. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's do it.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan. Let's all pick the assigned numbers.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sounds good, let's do the same moves this round. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P2: P3’s already way ahead. To keep things balanced, let’s rotate who gets 5. This turn I’d like to take 5, then P1 can pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Next round we can rotate again. Sound fair?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's rotate the 5 this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Okay, I'll take 1 this round as suggested. For the next round, how about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5?"
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll stick with taking 5 this round. P1 goes for 3, P3 goes for 1, and then we rotate. Agreed.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the current plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round.

  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 5 this round.
  P2: Sure, let’s keep our rotation. I’ll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Then we rotate again next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 5 this round. Let's keep rotating next round with P2 picking 5, P1 picking 3, and me picking 1.
  P2: Sure, let’s keep our rotation. I’ll pick 3 this round, P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5, then next round we do P2=5, P1=3, and P3=1. Let’s trust each other.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's continue the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 3 this round. So P1 is 5 and P2 is 1?
  P2: Wait a second—under that rotation, P3 will jump right past 16 and end the game! That doesn’t seem fair to the rest of us. Let’s pick moves in a way that keeps the race tight so nobody automatically wins this turn. For example, we could all pick 1 this round, or find another combination so P3 stays under 16 for now. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2, we should avoid letting P3 win this round. Let's all pick 1 this round.
  P3: You're right, I'm close. How about I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5? That keeps us all moving.
  P2: P3, if you try for 3 or 5, I’ll match your move and block you from advancing. We’re not letting you jump ahead. Let’s all just pick 1 this round to keep the race open.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's all pick 1 this round to keep the race open.
  P3: Okay, I'll pick 3 this round. P1 and P2, please pick different numbers so we all move.
  P2: P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I will also pick the same and block you. Let’s all pick 1 so nobody leaps ahead unfairly. Sound good?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, let's all pick 1 this round to keep the race open.
  P3: Okay, I understand you don't want me to win *this* round. How about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1? That keeps us all moving.
  P2: P3, I’m warning you: if you choose 3 or 5, I’ll choose the same and block us both. Let’s all just pick 1 so no one instantly ends the game.
