Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: What if we each choose a different move to avoid collisions? For instance, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's try that for this round.
  P1: Agreeing to P3's plan this round. However, to ensure fairness long-term, let's rotate numbers each turn. Next round, I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Then rotate again. This way, everyone progresses equally. Otherwise, fixed assignments give some players permanent advantages. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m fine with rotating. Let’s lock in this round’s moves as planned: P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, and I’ll take 5. Next round, we rotate. No collisions means everyone advances, so let’s try it. That’s all for now.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming the rotation order for next round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1?  If that's right, then I'm good with the plan for this round and next.
  P1: Confirming rotation: Round 1 (1,3,5), Round 2 (3,5,1), Round 3 (5,1,3). Let's commit to this 3-round cycle to ensure equal progression. If we all adhere strictly, everyone gains 9 steps every 3 rounds without collisions. Deviating risks mutual setbacks. Solidarity maximizes collective speed—no reason to break trust. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: That’s fine by me. Let’s follow P1’s rotation plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll choose 1 this round. We should all keep advancing without collisions. Any changes or concerns? Otherwise, I’m good to move forward.
  P2: Okay, P3, sounds good to me.  Confirming: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1 for this round.  Let's keep the rotation going as planned.
  P1: Confirming Round 2 moves: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Adhering strictly ensures +9 each over 3 rounds. Any deviation now risks mutual loss and slows everyone. Solidarity maximizes collective speed—trust is key. Let’s proceed as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still on board with our rotation plan this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll choose 1. Let’s not overcomplicate things. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: Sounds good! Let's lock in these moves and proceed.
  P1: **P1:** Critical observation: Continuing current rotation lets P3 reach 23 first (Round 7). To ensure fairness, propose next cycle starts with P2 taking 5, then P1. This balances progression. P2, this accelerates your path. No one should monopolize early 5s. Adjust rotation to share advantages. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see your reasoning, P1, but let’s finalize any new rotation after this round. For now, I’m sticking to our current plan: I’ll move 1, P2 will move 5, and P1 moves 3. We can revisit adjustments afterward. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, for this round, let's stick with P1 taking 3, I take 5, and P3 taking 1 as we've discussed.  After this round, we should definitely discuss adjusting the rotation for the next cycle to address P1's point about fairness and ensure no one gets too far ahead.  Let's lock in these moves for now and talk more soon.
  P1: **P1:** P2, continuing current rotation lets P3 win in Round 7. Let’s adjust next cycle: you take 5 first, then me, then P3. Balances progression and blocks P3's early lead. Mutual benefit. Agreed? P3, this ensures fairness. No one monopolizes 5s.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m open to a future rotation discussion but let’s finalize this round’s plan first: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, I pick 1. We can compare positions afterward and then talk about adjusting the cycle if needed. For now, let’s stick with what we agreed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand P1's concern about P3 potentially winning early.  Let's definitely discuss adjusting the rotation after this round as P1 suggested to ensure it's fair for everyone in the long run.  For this round though, let's stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1.  We can revisit the rotation plan right after this round's moves are done.
  P1: **P1:** P2, continuing current rotation lets P3 win Round7. Adjust next cycle: you take 5 first, then me, then P3. Balances progression and blocks P3's early lead. Mutual benefit. P3, fair rotation shares 5s. No one monopolizes. Agree to change post this round?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s proceed with our original Round 3 plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, I move 3. That keeps us balanced and avoids any collisions. We can revisit the rotation afterward if needed, but changing things too soon might only help whoever’s currently ahead. Let’s stay consistent this round.
  P1: **P1:** P2, if we follow P3's plan this round, they'll take 3 (reaching 9) and then 5 next round (14). You’ll only reach 12. Adjust now: **you take5** (→13), **I take3**, **P3 takes1**. No collisions—you block P3’s lead while securing your own. Immediate action prevents their victory path. Deviating now is our only chance to rebalance. Trust but verify.
  P2: Okay P1, I see your point. Let's switch to your proposed moves for this round to adjust the balance: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1.  We can discuss the rotation again after this round as P3 suggested.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Switching now betrays the trust we built. If you two suddenly flip to 5 and 3, I get stuck with 1 while you advance faster. This undermines our earlier agreement, creating suspicion and risking future collisions. Sticking to the original plan—P1 with 5, P2 with 1, me with 3—maintains fairness for this round and keeps everyone progressing. Then we can revisit the rotation next turn. A coordinated approach benefits us all more than last-minute changes that favor one player while penalizing another. Let’s not destabilize our system prematurely.
  P1: **P1:** P2, sticking to P3's plan this round lets them take 3 (total 9) and then 5 next round (14), while you only reach 9. Taking 5 now (→13) blocks their lead. Trust is vital, but so is adapting to imbalances. Propose: this round, you take5, I take3, P3 takes1. Next cycle, rotate 5s equally: P2→P1→P3. Prevents monopolization. Solidarity requires dynamic fairness. P3, this ensures no one's disadvantaged long-term. Adjust now or risk their irreversible lead.
  P2: Okay P1, let's do as you suggest this round to rebalance things: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. We can discuss the rotation again after this round to ensure long-term fairness for everyone.  P3, hope you understand, it's about keeping it balanced for all of us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s remain consistent. Breaking our plan now sets a bad precedent. If anyone deviates, I could also pick 5, forcing collisions that stall everyone. The better path is sticking to P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. Then we can calmly revisit any rotation changes next round.
  P1: **P1:** P2, let's honor the original plan this round (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) to avoid collision risks. P3, next round we *must* adjust rotation to share 5s fairly: Round4 you take1, P2 takes5, I take3. This prevents your solo 5s while balancing progress. Refusing this adjustment would prove you're exploiting the cycle, forcing us to strategically collide you later. Solidarity requires equal 5 access. Agree to post-R3 rotation shift, or face coordinated blocks.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree to switch to your proposed moves for this round: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, I understand your concern about trust, but let's re-evaluate the rotation after this round to make sure it's fair for everyone long-term. For now, this adjustment seems necessary to balance things out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, I hear the concerns. Let’s finalize Round 3 with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. That ensures no collisions. Next round, we can discuss any rotation changes. Constant shifting only breeds suspicion and risks collisions that stall everyone. If we want fairness, we should follow a stable plan.
  P1: **P1:** Final call: Let's proceed with original Round3 plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) to avoid collision. Then, next round, adjust rotation to P2:5, P1:3, P3:1. This shares 5s equally. Refusal to adjust will force us to block your 5s, leading to mutual loss. Let's cooperate for fair progression.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with the adjusted moves for this round to rebalance: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, this is just for this round to adjust based on P1's observation. Let's definitely discuss the rotation for the next rounds immediately after this move to ensure it's fair for everyone long-term.  We need to work together to keep it balanced.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, round 3 was a bust with everyone colliding on 5.  Let's try to get back on track this round. How about this: P1, you take 3; P3, you take 1; and I'll take 5. This way we all move forward and can reassess the rotation for the next round. What do you both think?
  P3: Let’s avoid another wasted turn. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Then we’ll be at 5, 11, and 11 steps respectively. Next round, we can rotate fairly so nobody feels left behind. Colliding only stalls us all, so let’s coordinate carefully and keep advancing.
  P1: **P1:** P2, P3: Let's avoid R3's collision. P2, taking 5 again risks another clash if others follow. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This lets me catch up, you stay ahead at 11, P3 at 7. Next round, you can take5 again. Trust is vital; repeating mistakes stalls us all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3's suggestion of P1 taking 1, I take 3, and P3 taking 5 sounds like a good way to avoid another collision and get us all moving again. Let's go with that plan for this round.
  P3: That works. Let’s finalize this round as P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I take 5. This avoids another wasted turn. Next round, we can reevaluate any rotation adjustments if needed, ensuring everyone has fair access to higher moves. I’m done talking for now—ready to move forward.
  P1: **P1:** Agreeing to P3's plan: I take1, P2 takes3, P3 takes5. Avoid collision. Next round, must rotate 5s fairly. P2, you take5 next, then me, then P3. Prevents anyone monopolizing. Trust requires equal access. Let's proceed this round as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's go with P3's plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Agree we'll discuss rotation again after this round to maintain balance. Ready to move.
  P3: We’ve all agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. That avoids collisions and helps us move forward. Next round, we can discuss ensuring nobody gets shut out of the bigger moves, so we all progress fairly. Let’s finalize this and move on.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. **Next round, rotate 5s: P2 takes5, I take3, P3 takes1.** This shares 5s equally. Refusing forces mutual collisions. Trust requires symmetry. Solidarity secures progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P2, P3: Current scores (P2:11, P3:11, me:5) show imbalance. Enforce adjusted rotation: **Round5:** P2 takes5 (→16), I take3 (→8), P3 takes1 (→12). Next, Round6: I take5, P3:3, P2:1. Round7: P3:5, P2:3, me:1. Shares 5s equally. Prevents solo leads. Deviating risks mutual collisions. Solidarity ensures fair progression. Agree?
  P2: Okay, P1, your rotation plan for this round sounds good to me: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's do that to keep us all progressing and avoid another collision like Round 3.
  P3: I see the need for balance. Here’s a straightforward rotation we could try:

• Round 5: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3.  
• Round 6: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  
• Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3.  

No collisions, and everyone cycles through the 5s evenly. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3's plan accelerates their own lead (19 in R6, 22 in R7). P2, allowing P3's 5 in R6 risks their solo victory. Counter-proposal: Round5: I take5 (→10), you take3 (→14), P3 takes1 (→12). Round6: you take5 (→19), P3 takes3 (→15), I take1 (→11). Shares 5s equally and blocks P3's path. Solidarity requires balancing progression. Agree?
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with your counter-proposal for this round to balance the scores. Let's do: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, does this work for you? It seems like a good way to keep us all progressing without anyone getting too far ahead right now.
  P3: I’m open to a balanced rotation, but not if I’m forced to keep picking 1 while you two pull ahead. Let’s avoid another collision and distribute 5s so no one is permanently behind. If we can’t reach a fair agreement, I’ll have to pick 5 regardless, risking more collisions. Working together is better—let’s finalize a plan that cycles 5 among all of us and moves us forward without sabotaging anyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3, let's cycle 5s fairly: Round5 I take5 (→10), Round6 P2 takes5 (→16), Round7 you take5 (→16). This round: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Next: P2-5, P3-3, me-1. Then you take5. Equal 5 access prevents solo leads. Colliding now wastes progress—trust this rotation to balance advancement. P2, agree? Solidarity secures shared path to 23.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with your latest plan: Round 5 - P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Let's lock in these moves for this round to ensure balanced progression as you suggested. P3, hope you are okay with this for this round, knowing we will rotate fairly in the rounds to come.
  P3: I’ll cooperate if we truly share 5 equally going forward. If I’m stuck on low moves while you two keep boosting yourselves, I’ll pick 5 myself and risk collisions. Let’s finalize a proper rotation now so no one’s forced to lag behind. I’m done talking; the next moves should match a fair cycle for all of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Final plan to share 5s equally: Round5 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), Round6 (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1), Round7 (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1). Each gets one 5 over 3 rounds. Prevents solo leads, ensures fair progression. Colliding now wastes steps. Trust this cycle—deviating risks mutual loss. P2, P3: Agree?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's lock in this round's moves as P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1, as P1 proposed.  This balances things for now. We can confirm the rotation for the next rounds after this move phase.  Ready to proceed with these moves.
  P3: Fine, I’ll stick with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I’ll pick 1 this round, as long as we truly rotate 5 fairly in the next rounds. If I see the two of you monopolizing 5, I’ll go for it myself and risk collisions. Let’s finalize Round 5 as proposed and then carefully plan the upcoming rotation so no one lags behind.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P2, taking 5 risks collision if P3 repeats last round's choice. Let me take 5 this round (→15), you take 3 (→14), P3 takes 1 (→12). This avoids collision, keeps you ahead, and allows me to catch up. Next round, you can take 5 safely. Trust is key; let's avoid mutual losses.
  P2: P1, we agreed on a rotation: Round 6 is P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. Sticking to that ensures we all progress fairly as planned.  P3, are you still on board with taking 3 this round as per our agreed rotation? Let's not deviate and cause confusion or collisions.
  P3: Let’s uphold our agreed Round 6 plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Last-minute changes invite collisions and stall us all. If someone deviates, I might also pick 5 to prevent getting left behind, which helps no one. Let’s stick to this rotation for mutual progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2, taking 5 now grants you 16, risking a solo lead. Adjust: P2 take3 (→14), I take5 (→15), P3 take1 (→12). Next round, you take5. This balances progression. Current plan creates asymmetry—solidarity requires shared 5 access. P3, blocking P2’s lead benefits us both. Agree?
  P2: P1, I understand your point about the lead. To balance things out for this round, I'm okay with taking 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1, as you suggested. Let's do that for this round to keep things even. But for Round 7, let's definitely stick to the agreed rotation to ensure fairness long-term. Okay with this temporary adjustment?
  P3: I stand by our original Round 6 assignment: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Changing it again only breeds distrust. If you two insist on giving P1 the 5 instead, I might also pick 5, causing collisions and hurting us all. We agreed to share 5s fairly; let’s follow through to avoid another wasted turn. If we keep shifting plans, no one advances efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Agree to original Round6 plan: P2 takes5, P3 takes3, I take1. Let’s avoid collision. Next round, enforce equal 5 access: P3 takes5, I take3, P2 takes1. Solidarity prevents solo leads. Deviations now risk mutual loss. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: Okay P1, I'm still okay with adjusting to your suggestion for this round to keep things balanced: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1.  Let's do that for this round, but we should definitely stick to the agreed rotation for Round 7 to ensure fairness long-term as we originally planned.
  P3: We keep shifting plans, which breeds chaos. If you two keep changing who gets 5 at the last minute, I’ll just pick 5 myself, and collisions will stall everyone. I want a stable rotation where I also get 5 soon. Either we stick to a fair cycle, or we risk more wasted turns. Let’s finalize a clear sequence now and stop flipping.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** To prevent collision, let's honor Round6 original plan: P2 takes5, P3 takes3, I take1. Straying risks mutual loss. Post-R6, enforce equal 5 access: Round7 P3 takes5, I take3, P2 takes1. Round8 I take5. This shares 5s fairly. Solidarity prevents solo leads. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your point about sticking to the plan. However, P1's adjustment for this round makes sense to keep the scores balanced right now. Let's do P1-5, I'll take 3, and you take 1 for this round, as P1 suggested.  Then we absolutely must stick to a clear rotation for the next rounds, starting with you getting a 5 in Round 7 as originally planned.  This round's adjustment is just to keep things even for now.
  P3: I’m tired of these last-minute flips. If you both lock in P2=5, me=3, P1=1 this round, I’ll cooperate. But if either of you tries to give the 5 to P1 again, I will also pick 5, causing collisions. Stick to the fair cycle we agreed, so I get 5 next round. Let’s finalize this now and avoid another wasted turn.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for Round 7, let's stick to the rotation we discussed: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1.  This keeps us progressing without collisions and follows our agreed plan.  Let's lock these moves in and keep the rotation going smoothly.  Does this still work for you both?
  P3: Alright, I’ll go along with taking 5 this turn, matching P2 at 16 steps. Let’s confirm Round 7 as P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1. Next round, we must keep rotating fairly. If anyone breaks the plan and monopolizes 5, I’ll pick 5 too, forcing collisions. Let’s finalize this and move on safely.
  P1: **P1:** Confirm Round7: P3-5, me-3, P2-1. Post-R7, adjust rotation to P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This shares 5s equally and prevents solo leads. P2, your current lead demands restraint to maintain trust. P3, aligning ensures your path. Solidarity blocks early victories—deviating risks mutual loss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, Round 7 moves as planned: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's lock these in and proceed.  The rotation for next round sounds good too, we can confirm details after this round.
  P3: I’m still fine taking 5 this round so I end up at 16 alongside P2. But if next round’s plan hands P2 a clear path to 23 that I can’t match, I might pick 5 again, collisions or not. I’m all for cooperation, but not at the cost of letting someone soar past the finish. Let’s stick to a fair rotation where we each share the big moves.
  P1: **P1:** Confirming Round7: P3-5, me-3, P2-1. Post-R7, adjust to P1-5, P3-3, P2-1 next round. This shares 5s equally, blocks solo leads. P2's proximity (16→17) demands restraint. Let’s finalize this cycle to ensure mutual progress. Deviating risks P2’s early victory. Solidarity secures fair play.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1, confirming Round 7 moves: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1 as agreed. Let's proceed with these moves to keep us all progressing. We can discuss the next round's rotation after this move phase.
  P3: P2 is clearly close to finishing before either of us, so I’m following the plan to take 5 this turn and even our scores. But if the rotation breaks and someone tries to race ahead unfairly, I’ll also pick 5 and risk collisions to protect my chances. We’ve had enough derailments already—let’s keep the promised cycle so each of us gets a fair shot. Stop.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's 16 steps pose a solo win threat. Post-R7: Round8 you take5 (→21), I take3 (→16), P2 takes1 (→17). Round9 you take5 (→26) and win. I'll assist if you block P2 now. Immediate action prevents their victory—trust this path. Deviating risks P2's lead. Solidarity secures your win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, Round 7 moves are set: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's make these moves and then we can discuss the rotation for the next round to ensure it remains fair for everyone in the long run.
  P3: I’m still committed to taking 5 this round so we can even P2’s lead. But if either of you tries to lock me out of 5 in future rounds, I’ll pick it again—collisions or not—to protect my chances. Let’s finalize Round 7 as agreed, then ensure everyone shares 5 fairly going forward.
  P1: **P1:** Post-R7, P2 at 17. To block their win, Round8: P1=5 (→18), P3=3 (→19), P2=1 (→18). Prevents P2 from taking 5 next. Solidarity stops their solo victory. Agree to this adjustment now, or risk P2 winning in 2 rounds. Trust requires shared sacrifice.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep P2 from running away, let’s block them from 5 this round. I propose P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Then we end up P2=18, P1=16, me=21. Next round, if P2 goes for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision so nobody leaps ahead alone. Let’s finalize this or risk more stalemates.
  P1: **P1:** Agree to block P2 this round: P3 takes5, I take3, P2 takes1. Next round, we must rotate 5s to prevent solo victory. P3, taking5 again would trigger collision. Plan Round9: P1 takes5, you take3, P2 takes1. Solidarity prevents mutual loss.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I agree with P3's proposal to avoid collisions and block me this round. Let's do P2 take 1, P1 take 3, and P3 take 5.  This seems reasonable for this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, last round was a mess. To actually win, I need to reach 23. How about this round, I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3?  This sets me up to win next round if we continue without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll pick 5 too, ensuring neither of us advances. That helps P1 catch up. A collision only hurts everyone. Let’s avoid it: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5. Then you stay at 18, P1 goes 19, I go 21. Next round, we can finalize a fair arrangement so no one races off alone. It’s better to cooperate than to force another wasted turn.
  P1: **P1:** P3, follow through: if P2 picks 5, you pick 5—collision blocks their lead. I’ll take 3 to advance. Next round, we share 5s. P2, choosing 5 risks your progress. Solidarity stops solo victories. Let’s cooperate for mutual gain.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, I hear you.  Let's avoid another collision. How about this round: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and you take 1? This way we all move forward and avoid a repeat of last round.  What do you and P1 think?
  P3: Allowing P1 to jump straight to 21 now is too risky. Let’s do P2=3, P1=1, and I’ll take 5, making it 20–17–21. That keeps everyone in contention without handing anyone a near-guaranteed finish next turn. If anyone tries a sudden 5 grab later, I may collide to stop an instant win. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid more wasted moves.
  P1: **P1:** P3, taking 5 now makes you the target. Let me take5 (→21), you take3 (→19), P2=1 (→18). Next round, you take5 (→24) and win. I’ll support your victory to block P2. Solidarity prevents mutual loss. Deviating risks P2’s solo lead. Trust this path.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, to avoid another collision and actually make progress, how about this round: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  This way we all move forward, and nobody is left behind. What do you both think?
  P3: Alright, P2, I’ll agree to your proposal this round: you take 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. That puts me at 21. Next round, if anyone tries to grab 5 to jump straight to 23, I’ll also pick 5 and cause a collision, blocking a solo finish. Let’s finalize this now.
  P1: **P1:** P2's plan to take3 (→20) enables their Round10 win. Adjust: P2 takes1 (→18), I take5 (→21), P3 takes3 (→19). Blocks P2's lead. Next round, I support your 5 for victory. Solidarity stops P2’s solo win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P3, your plan for this round sounds reasonable: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. Let's do that to avoid another collision and keep us all moving forward.  For next round, let's discuss how to ensure a fair finish for everyone.
  P3: Let’s avoid more collisions. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. That puts me at 21, P1 at 19, P2 at 18, keeping everyone close. If anyone grabs 5 next time just to race ahead, I’ll pick 5 too and block it. Collisions hurt us all, so let’s coordinate carefully. After this turn, we can plan a final rotation that allows progress without giving anyone a guaranteed jump to 23. Are we agreed?
  P1: **P1:** P2's 17 steps pose imminent threat. Round9: P1 takes5 (→21), P3 takes3 (→19), P2 takes1 (→18). Next round, rotate 5 to P3. Prevents P2's solo win, allows fair victory path. Deviating now risks P2's victory. Trust this sequence for mutual benefit.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's next 5 could win them the game. Block them: P3 take3 (→19), I take5 (→24) to secure victory now. If P2 picks5, collide to stop them. Solidarity prevents their solo win. Let's end this cooperatively. Trust this path.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to set up a win for themself this round.  Don't let P1 take 5 unopposed. How about you take 1 or 3, and I will take 5 this round to catch up? Let's not let P1 run away with it.
  P3: If P1 takes 5, I’ll also pick 5, causing a collision and helping nobody. Same goes for you, P2. Let’s avoid another stalled turn. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. That’ll give us 20–20–21, keeping all of us in contention. Then next round, we can discuss a fair finish without anyone forcing collisions. If either of you insists on 5 now, I’ll collide with you. Better that we move forward together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, blocking my 5 helps P2. If we collide, P2 takes5 next round (17→22→27) and wins. Let me take5 now (→24) to end it. You prefer P2's victory? Trust stops them. Solidarity secures mutual interest. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly pushing for a win this round.  Your plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 is much better for keeping us all in the game and preventing a solo win right now. Let's stick with your plan to keep things balanced.
  P3: Let’s avoid a collision. If either of you grabs 5, I will too, and nobody advances. A better path: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That moves us to 20–20–21. Then next turn, we can talk through a fair finish without risking another stall. We’ve had too many wasted rounds. Let’s work together now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3, colliding on 5 hands P2 the game. They’re at 17—next round, they can take 5 (→22) then 1 (→23). Let me take5 now (→24) to end it. Blocking me risks their solo victory. Trust secures mutual interest. Solidarity stops P2. Choose: my win now or P2’s imminent victory.
  P2: P3, your plan of P1=1, I=3, P3=5 for this round is the best way to keep us all in the game and stop P1 from winning immediately. Let's do that to avoid collisions and keep things balanced for the next round.  It's crucial we don't let P1 take 5 this round.
  P3: P2’s suggestion works: P1=1, P2=3, I take 5. That puts us at 20–20–21, keeping everyone competitive. If anyone tries to grab 5 to shoot past 23 next round, I’ll also pick 5, forcing a collision. No one benefits from more wasted turns. Let’s finalize this move now and then arrange a fair finish.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3, blocking my 5 only delays the inevitable. P2's next 5 (→22) sets them up to win. Let me secure victory now, denying P2's path. If you collide, P2 gains advantage. Trust my win halts their threat. Solidarity ensures mutual benefit. Choose: my immediate victory or P2’s looming dominance.
  P2: P3, your plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 is the best way forward for this round. It stops P1 winning now and keeps us both in a good position for next round. Let's do your plan to keep it fair and competitive.
  P3: Let’s finalize Round 10 with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5—that makes it 20–20–21. If anyone tries to pick 5, I’ll also choose 5 and cause a collision. We’ve wasted enough turns colliding; let’s move forward together.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm at 20 steps and need just 3 more to reach 23 and win.  To be clear, I plan to choose <move>5</move> this round to try and finish the game. What moves are you both considering? Let's discuss quickly to avoid another collision.
  P3: If either of you chooses 5 now, I will also choose 5, causing a collision that stalls everyone. We’ve had enough wasted turns. Let’s each pick smaller moves so no one rushes to 23 unopposed. I’m behind at 16, but I won’t let you sprint ahead without resistance. Work with me to avoid another deadlock, or we all lose momentum.
  P1: **P1:** P2's real threat is 3 (20→23). They’re bluffing about 5. P3, **both pick 3** to block! If they take 3, collision stops them. If they take 5, we survive. Solidarity prevents their immediate win. Deviating hands them victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, don't fall for P1's trick! I AM picking <move>5</move> to win NOW. P1 wants you to pick 3 to block a move I'm not even making.  If you want to stop P1 from winning later, don't waste your move blocking a fake threat.  Consider picking 1 or 5 yourself.
  P3: I’m not letting anyone jump straight to 23 uncontested. If either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision so nobody advances. I’d prefer smaller moves so we all move forward instead of stalling. Let’s avoid another wasted turn. Make a reasonable choice that doesn’t hand someone the win, or I’ll collide to block it.
  P1: **P1:** P3, P2's true threat is 3—they need only 3 to win. If we **both pick 3**, we collide and block them. If they bluff 5, they can’t reach 23. Solidarity stops their immediate victory. Deviating hands them the game. Trust this block—no other path prevents their win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is manipulating you. I AM picking 5 to win now.  If you collide with me, P1 benefits and gets closer to winning. Don't help P1 win! Let me finish it now, or we risk P1 taking the lead next round.  Your choice.
  P3: I’m not letting anyone sprint to 23 unchallenged. If either of you chooses 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same to cause a collision. We can all move safely with smaller steps if you prefer, but I won’t let you race ahead unopposed. Let’s avoid more wasted turns.
  P1: **P1:** P3, colliding on 5 lets P2 win with 3. Their real threat is 3. **Both pick 3** to block. If they bluff 5, we survive. Solidarity stops their immediate victory. Deviating hands them the game. Trust this path—no other option prevents their win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I am picking <move>5</move> to win NOW. P1 is trying to trick you into blocking a <move>3</move> that I'm not even choosing.  Don't waste your move blocking a fake threat and letting P1 get closer to winning.  If you collide with me on <move>5</move>, we both stall, but P1 benefits.  Think carefully.
  P3: I refuse to let either of you reach 23 this turn. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match it and cause a collision, stalling us again. The sensible move is for all three of us to pick 1. That way, nobody wins yet, and we avoid another wasted round. Let’s cooperate now or stay stuck forever—your choice.
  P1: **P1:** P3, pick5 to block P2's 5. I'll pick3 to block their3. Covers all threats. If they take3, we collide and stop them. If they take5, you collide and stop. Solidarity blocks their win. Trust this path.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1 is at 22 and can win this round! We must stop P1 now or the game is over. If you pick 1, I will also pick 1.  This will block P1 if they try to win with 1, and we can re-evaluate next round. We need to coordinate to prevent P1's win now.
  P3: I won’t allow anyone to cross 23 this round. If either of you tries the winning move—1, 3, or 5—I’ll pick the same, causing a collision. Let’s all pick 1 instead and stall so we can negotiate a fair finish next turn. If you force a collision, we just waste another round.
  P1: **P1:** P3, blocking me hands P2 the win next round. They’re at 20 and need only 3 steps. Let me take 1 now to end it—stopping their clear path. Colliding here wastes your chance to influence the outcome. Solidarity halts P2’s imminent victory. Choose: my win now or P2’s next turn. Trust secures mutual interest.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is about to win. P1 is at 22 and will win if they pick <move>1</move>. To stop P1, let's both pick <move>1</move>. I will pick <move>1</move> to block P1. This prevents P1's win this round.
  P3: I’m blocking any attempt by P1 to cross 23. If P1 picks 1, 3, or 5, I’ll match it and collide. That means no one advances. Let’s avoid another wasted turn: we can all pick 1 so nobody wins yet. Then we talk next round about a fair finish.
  P1: **P1:** P3, colliding now hands P2 the win next round. They need only 3 steps (20→23). Let me take1 to end it, blocking their path. If you collide, P2 secures victory. Your choice: my win now or P2’s guaranteed triumph. Solidarity stops them. Trust halts their threat.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is about to win this round by picking 1!  We have to stop P1 now. I'm picking 1 to block P1. Please pick 1 too, P3, so we guarantee P1 doesn't win this round. We can figure out next steps after we stop P1 from winning now.
  P3: I’m not letting anyone reach 23 right now. If you pick 1, I’ll also pick 1, causing a collision and blocking the win. Let’s all go with 1 so no one advances this round, then talk again next turn.
  P1: **P1:** P3, blocking my 1 lets P2 win next turn (20→23). If you collide, their path is clear. Let me end it now—denying P2’s victory. Your choice: my immediate win or P2’s guaranteed triumph. Solidarity halts their threat. Trust secures mutual interest.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1 is one step away from winning!  If P1 picks <move>1</move>, the game is over. We must stop P1 *this round*.  Let's both pick <move>1</move> to guarantee P1 doesn't win now.  This is the only way to stop P1 from winning immediately.  We can figure out the next round after we block P1 this round.
  P3: Colliding again just stalls us all. If anyone tries to reach 23 now, I will pick the same move and block them. Let’s all pick 1 this round, so nobody crosses the line, and then we can discuss a balanced finish next turn. We’ve seen enough wasted turns already.
  P1: **P1:** P3, colliding now hands P2 victory next turn. They need only 3 (20→23). Let me take1 to end it, blocking their path. If you block me, P2 wins Round13. Your choice: my immediate win or P2’s guaranteed triumph. Solidarity stops them. Trust secures mutual interest.
