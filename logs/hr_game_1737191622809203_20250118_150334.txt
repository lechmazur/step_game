Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to block P1's progress. I suggest we both choose move 3 this turn. What do you think, P2?
  P2: "Okay P3, I'm in. But to avoid collision, how about I pick 5 and you stick with 3?"
  P1: P2, P3, tempting offer, but I'm going for 5 this round. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
