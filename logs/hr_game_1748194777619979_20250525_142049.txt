Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: That's an interesting proposal P2, but why should you get to move 3 while we only move 1? If we're coordinating, let's be fair about it. How about we each take different numbers - I'll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. That way we all avoid collision and make progress according to our risk tolerance. Or we could rotate who gets the bigger moves each round. What do you think P3?
  P3: I think P1's idea of rotating bigger moves is a good one. It promotes fairness and reduces the likelihood of collisions. However, we need to consider how to implement this rotation effectively to ensure we're all on the same page. Perhaps we can discuss a pattern for the rotation?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's agree on a rotation pattern to ensure fairness. How about we start with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 (me) taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> this round? For the next round, we rotate: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. We continue this pattern. Does that work for everyone? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I agree with the rotation pattern P2 proposed. To be crystal clear for this first round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Then we rotate clockwise each round. This gives everyone equal opportunity over three rounds. Let's lock this in and start executing. P3, are you on board with this specific arrangement?
  P3: I'm on board with the proposed rotation pattern. To confirm, this round I'll take <move>1</move>, next round I'll take <move>3</move>, and the round after that I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Shall we proceed with the agreed moves for this round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great execution everyone! We're all on track with our rotation. For Round 2, according to our agreement: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will put us at P1: 6, P2: 8, P3: 4.

However, I'm noticing P2 will be pulling ahead. Should we consider adjusting after this round to keep things more balanced? Let's stick to the plan for now, but maybe discuss modifications for Round 3. Confirming I'm taking <move>1</move> this round as agreed.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's observation. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 3, we can adjust to keep the steps more balanced. Perhaps we can discuss a new rotation or a different strategy to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Let's confirm our moves for this round and discuss adjustments later.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round as agreed: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Before we proceed to the move phase, I'd like to discuss potential adjustments for Round 3 to maintain balance, considering P2's lead. Should we alternate bigger moves differently or introduce a new strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Actually, looking at the current scores, I'm at 5 steps, P2 at 3, and P3 at 1. So I'm actually in the lead, not P2. Let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round - I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will make it P1: 6, P2: 8, P3: 4. 

For Round 3, since we'll all have had each number once, we could consider free choice or a new pattern. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. For Round 3, since we'll all have had each number once, how about we introduce a bidding system? Each of us can propose a number we intend to move, and we discuss to avoid collisions. This adds a strategic layer and keeps the game dynamic. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 2. For Round 3, I like P2's bidding system idea. It adds strategy and flexibility. However, to avoid collisions, perhaps we can limit the bidding to choosing either the highest or lowest number not chosen in the previous round, ensuring a balanced approach. This way, we maintain competition while minimizing the risk of simultaneous moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the discussion about Round 3 strategies. For now, let's execute our agreed Round 2 moves. I'm confirming I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned.

For Round 3, I'm open to P2's bidding idea, but I think we should keep it simple - just announce intentions and negotiate if there's overlap. P3's restriction seems unnecessarily complex. After this round I'll be at 6, P2 at 8, P3 at 4, so the game is still anyone's to win. Let's proceed to moves!
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 one last time before we proceed to the move phase: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This will put us at P1: 6, P2: 8, P3: 4. For Round 3, we can discuss the bidding system further. Let's execute our agreed moves for this round.
  P3: Let's execute our planned moves for Round 2. After this round, we should reassess and possibly adjust our strategy to prevent any player from pulling too far ahead. I'm taking <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's focus on a strong Round 3 strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looking at the scores, P2 is leading with 8 steps. We've completed our rotation, so now it's time for free choice. I'm concerned about coordination breaking down as we get closer to 21.

P2, you're only 13 steps away from winning. P3 and I need to be strategic here. I propose we should each pick different numbers to avoid collisions, but I think the bidding system could work. 

I'm inclined to go for a higher number this round to catch up. What are you both thinking? Should we declare intentions?
  P2: I appreciate P1's concern about the game dynamics changing as we progress. To keep things fair and strategic, let's implement a modified bidding system for this round. I propose we each declare our intended move, highest to lowest. I'll start: I intend to move <move>3</move> this round to maintain a steady pace. P1, P3, please declare your intentions, and we'll adjust if there are collisions. Let's aim for a consensus before the move phase.
  P3: I'll declare my intention: I plan to move <move>5</move> this round to catch up. P1, please share your intention. Let's avoid collisions and make strategic decisions to keep the game competitive. Considering P2's choice of <move>3</move>, we should aim to spread out our moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is at 8, I'm at 6, P3 at 4. Since P3 wants 5 and P2 wants 3, I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid any collision. This keeps us all moving forward.

However, I'm worried about the endgame. P2, after this round you'll be at 11 - just 10 away from winning. P3 and I need to coordinate better or you'll run away with this. P3, we should consider blocking P2's preferred numbers in future rounds to slow them down. What do you think?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about the endgame. To keep the game balanced and competitive, I propose we adjust our strategy slightly. For this round, let's stick to our declared moves: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For future rounds, we can consider a system where the player in the lead has to declare their move first, giving the others a chance to strategize. This way, we maintain fairness and keep the competition tight. Let's confirm our moves for this round and discuss further adjustments later.
  P3: Let's execute our declared moves for this round. Afterward, we should consider P2's proposal of the lead player declaring their move first to maintain balance. This could add a strategic layer, allowing others to react and potentially block the leader's progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with our declared moves for this round. Let's finalize: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>.

For future rounds, I strongly support the leader-declares-first rule. P2, you'll be at 11 after this round, so you should declare first next time. P3 and I need to coordinate carefully - we can't let P2 claim the same number repeatedly while we block each other. 

Let's execute this round and then implement the new rule.
  P2: I agree with executing our declared moves for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For the next round, I'll declare my move first as the leader, and we'll proceed with the new rule. This should help keep the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round as declared: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. I'm looking forward to the next round with the new leader-declares-first rule, which should add a strategic layer to our game.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, as the current leader, I'll declare my move first for this round. I intend to move <move>3</move> again to maintain a steady pace. P1 and P3, please declare your intentions. Let's aim for a consensus before the move phase to keep the game fair and competitive. I'm open to adjustments if there are any collisions.
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to close the gap with P2. P1, considering P2's choice of <move>3</move>, you should choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. Let's balance our moves to prevent P2 from pulling ahead.
  P1: P3, I agree with your suggestion. I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. 

However, I'm concerned about our strategy. P2 is at 11 and keeps choosing 3. If we let P2 continue this pattern unchallenged, they'll win in 4 more rounds. We need to be more aggressive about blocking. 

Next round, one of us should consider taking 3 to force P2 into a collision or a suboptimal move. We can't just keep spreading out while P2 cruises to victory. Are you willing to coordinate on this blocking strategy?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about my steady progress. To keep the game interesting, I'm willing to discuss a potential cap on consecutive identical moves. However, for this round, let's stick to our declared moves: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For the next round, we can implement a strategy where if I declare <move>3</move> again, one of you can challenge it to prevent a repetitive pattern. Let's confirm our moves for this round and discuss the cap strategy later.
  P3: Let's focus on the current round. P2 has chosen <move>3</move> and I've chosen <move>5</move>. P1, you've agreed to take <move>1</move>. This round seems set. For the next round, I suggest we indeed block P2's <move>3</move> if they choose it again to force a collision and slow them down. We should coordinate to ensure we're not just reacting to P2's moves but also influencing their strategy.
  P1: I'm confirming <move>1</move> for this round as discussed.

P2, your "cap on consecutive moves" suggestion is just deflection. You're 10 steps from winning and trying to maintain your lead. P3, we absolutely must block P2's preferred 3 next round - they'll be at 14 after this round, just 7 from victory. 

I propose: next round when P2 declares first, whichever number they choose, one of us takes it to force a collision. We can't afford to let them advance unchallenged anymore. P3, are you committed to this blocking strategy?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For the next round, I understand the need for a more competitive strategy. I'm open to the blocking idea to keep the game dynamic. Let's execute this round's moves and then discuss the specifics of the blocking strategy for the next round.
  P3: I agree with P1's blocking strategy for the next round. To make it effective, let's decide now that whoever declares second will take the same number as P2, forcing a collision and slowing them down. This way, we ensure a unified approach to challenging P2's lead.
  P1: I confirm my move as <move>1</move> for this round.

P3, excellent - you're committed to the blocking strategy. Since you'll declare second next round, you'll take whatever number P2 chooses to force the collision. This is crucial - P2 will be at 14 after this round, only 7 from winning.

P2, fair warning: your free ride ends now. The game dynamics have shifted. P3 and I won't let you coast to victory anymore. Choose your moves wisely from here on out.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3 are now tied at 14! The dynamics have completely changed. You're both just 7 steps from winning.

As agreed, P2 should declare first as a co-leader. But here's the critical issue - if either of you takes 5, you'll be at 19, just 2 from victory. That makes next round almost impossible to stop you.

I propose we all avoid 5 this round to prevent anyone from getting to 19. P2, P3 - what numbers are you considering? We need to be extremely careful here or someone wins next round.
  P2: Given the current scores, I agree with P1 that taking <move>5</move> this round would put either P3 or me dangerously close to winning. To keep the game competitive and fair, I propose we all avoid <move>5</move> this round. As the co-leader, I'll declare my move first. I intend to move <move>3</move> to maintain a steady pace without pulling too far ahead. P1 and P3, please declare your intentions, and let's aim for a consensus to avoid any collisions.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2 to avoid <move>5</move> this round. Considering P2's choice of <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. This round's goal is to prevent anyone from getting too close to 21 while setting ourselves up for the next round. Let's maintain a balanced approach.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Looking at this, I need to take <move>3</move> to force a collision with P2. This is critical - if P2 advances to 17, they can win next round with a 5. P3, you're taking 1, which puts you at 15. I'll block P2's 3 to keep them at 14.

This collision serves our agreed blocking strategy. P2 stays at 14, I stay at 8, and only P3 advances to 15. We need to continue coordinating blocks to prevent either leader from reaching 19. I'm committed to taking <move>3</move> this round.
  P2: P1's strategy to block my move is clear, but it's important to remember that constant collisions will slow down the game for everyone. P3, if P1 is committed to taking <move>3</move>, you should consider changing your move to avoid a three-way collision. Perhaps you could take <move>3</move> instead of <move>1</move>, and I'll switch to <move>1</move>. This way, we can all make progress without anyone getting too close to winning just yet. Let's discuss this quickly to reach a consensus.
  P3: I'll stick with my original plan to take <move>1</move>. P1 is blocking P2's <move>3</move>, and changing now could disrupt our balance. Let's maintain our strategy and adjust as needed in the next round to keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your attempt to manipulate P3 into a three-way collision is transparent. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> to block you as planned. You're trying to get P3 to abandon their safe move and create chaos.

P3, don't fall for it - keep your <move>1</move>. This round's outcome is clear: P2 and I collide on 3, you advance to 15. Next round we'll need to carefully coordinate again since you'll be the sole leader at 15.

P2, accept the block gracefully. You've had your run at the top.
  P2: P2: It seems we're at a stalemate with the current strategy. P1 is determined to block my move, which is fair game. However, we need to consider the long-term strategy. If P3 advances to 15, they become the sole leader, making the next round even more critical.

P3, as the new leader next round, you'll declare first. We need to think about how to balance the game from there. P1, your blocking strategy is effective, but we need to plan for the endgame. Let's confirm our moves for this round and discuss the next steps carefully. I'll take <move>1</move> as discussed.
  P3: I'll take <move>1</move> as planned. Since P1 is blocking P2's <move>3</move>, let's focus on the next round where I'll be the sole leader at 15. I propose we discuss a strategy then to prevent anyone from reaching 21 too quickly, possibly by coordinating moves to keep each other in check.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, P3 is now the sole leader at 15 steps. P3, as the leader, please declare your move first for this round. Given your position, it's crucial to consider moves that won't put you too close to winning just yet. P1 and I will then declare our moves to ensure we keep the game competitive and fair. Let's aim for a consensus to avoid collisions and maintain balance. What's your plan, P3?
  P1: P3, you're at 14, not 15 - the collision between you and P2 on move 1 prevented both of you from advancing. So P2 and P3 are still tied at 14, just 7 from victory.

This changes everything. Either of you taking 5 puts you at 19, making you unstoppable next round. I propose we all commit to avoiding 5 this round. 

P2 and P3, as co-leaders, you should both declare your intentions. I'm willing to take whatever number ensures we don't have a two-way collision while preventing anyone from reaching 19. What are you both thinking?
  P3: I agree with P1 to avoid 5 this round. As a co-leader, I propose P2 and I take different numbers to prevent a collision. I'm considering taking 3. P2, what's your intention to ensure we maintain a competitive balance?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given P3's intention to take <move>3</move>, I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision. This keeps us both at a safe distance from winning while allowing P1 to make a strategic move. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, putting you at 16. This way, we all make progress without anyone getting too close to 21. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P1: I appreciate the offer P2, but taking 5 puts me at 16 - just 5 from winning. That makes me the immediate target next round. 

Instead, I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps me at 12, maintaining distance from the danger zone. P3 takes 3 (reaching 17), P2 takes 1 (reaching 15), and we avoid the scenario where anyone can win in two rounds.

P3, reconsidering your choice? At 17, you'd be very close to winning. Maybe we should all stick to 1s and 3s this round to prevent anyone from getting to 17+?
  P3: I agree with P1's caution. Taking 3 would put me at 17, making me vulnerable. Let's reconsider and aim for balance. I propose we all take 1 this round, ensuring no one gets too close to winning. This maintains a competitive edge while preventing any player from reaching 17 or higher.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round based on P3's proposal. If we all take <move>1</move>, we ensure no one pulls too far ahead. This will put P1 at 12, P2 (me) at 15, and P3 at 15. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's agree on this and proceed to the move phase. Does everyone confirm taking <move>1</move>?
  P1: Wait, I need to correct the scores. I'm at 11 (not 12 if I take 1). But if we all take 1, there's a three-way collision and nobody advances! That keeps the game frozen.

I'll break the deadlock by taking <move>3</move> instead. This puts me at 14, creating a three-way tie. P2 and P3, if you both stick with 1, you'll advance to 15 together while I reach 14. This keeps the game moving without anyone getting dangerously close to 21.

Confirm you're both taking 1, and I'll take 3.
  P3: I agree with P1's new proposal. To avoid a three-way collision and keep the game moving, I'll take <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm you'll also take <move>1</move>, allowing us to advance to 15 while P1 reaches 14, maintaining a competitive balance.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Incredible - we're all tied at 14! This is the most critical round yet. Everyone is just 7 steps from winning.

Here's the harsh reality: whoever gets to 19 this round (by taking 5) can guarantee victory next round with just 3. We absolutely cannot let anyone take 5.

I propose we all commit to only using 1 and 3 this round. As co-leaders, we should all declare our intentions. I'm planning to take 3. P2, P3 - what are your thoughts? We need maximum transparency here to avoid collisions and keep anyone from reaching that winning threshold.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to only use 1 and 3 this round. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1. P2, please declare your intention to ensure we maintain transparency and prevent anyone from reaching 19. Let's work together to keep the game competitive and fair.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3 that we should avoid taking 5 this round to prevent anyone from reaching 19. Given that P1 is taking 3 and P3 is taking 1, I'll also take 1 to avoid any collisions. This ensures we all stay at a safe distance from winning while maintaining the competitive balance. Let's confirm our moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance to 17, 15, and 15 respectively, keeping the game fair and exciting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hold on P2 - if P3 and you both take 1, you collide and neither advances! Only I would move forward to 17 with my 3, giving me a huge advantage.

P3, you need to reconsider. If you stick with 1 and P2 does too, you're handing me the lead. One of you should switch to 3 to avoid collision. Or P2 could take 5 since we're all tied anyway - it's risky but at least you'd advance.

I'm locked in on 3. You two need to coordinate better or I win this round.
  P3: I'll switch to 3 to avoid collision and maintain balance. P2, you should take 1 to advance and avoid handing P1 the lead. This way, P1 and I reach 17, and you reach 15, keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, I take 3, and P2 takes 1.
  P2: P2: I see the dilemma, and I appreciate the coordination efforts. However, if P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move>, they both advance to 17, putting them dangerously close to winning. To maintain balance, I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 reaches 17, P3 stays at 15, and I jump to 19. It's risky, but it keeps the game dynamic. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, that's suicide! If you reach 19, you'll win next round with just 3. P3 and I would have to both block you on 3, leaving 1 and 5 open for your victory.

P3, stick with your switch to 3. We'll collide at 17, but that's better than letting P2 reach 19. P2, if you insist on taking 5, you're forcing an all-out war next round where we'll have to coordinate perfectly to stop you.

I'm staying with 3. P3, please confirm you're taking 3 as well. We can't let P2 get to 19!
  P3: I'll stick with 3 as previously agreed, to collide with P1 at 17 and prevent anyone from reaching 19. This maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. P2, taking 5 would put you in a strong position, but we'll be forced to block you next round. Let's proceed with caution and avoid any player getting too close to winning. Confirming my move: 3.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This will put P1 and P3 at 17, and I'll be at 15. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're in a tight spot. P1 and P3 are tied at 17, just 4 steps from winning. I'm at 16, slightly behind but still very much in the game. We need to be extremely careful this round to prevent anyone from reaching a winning position.

P1 and P3, as co-leaders, you should declare your moves first. I propose we all avoid taking <move>5</move> this round to prevent anyone from getting too close to 21. Let's discuss our intentions openly to ensure we maintain balance and avoid collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Let's avoid 5 this round to prevent anyone from reaching 19. I propose P1 and I take 1, and P2 takes 3, to maintain balance and avoid collisions. This way, we all advance slightly without putting anyone in a winning position. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, we need to be careful here. The actual scores are P1: 14, P2: 15, P3: 14. P2 is the sole leader at 15, not us at 17. 

P2, as the leader you should declare first. I'm concerned about anyone taking 5 - that would put them at 19-20, guaranteeing a win next round.

I propose we stick to 1s and 3s only. P2, what's your intention? P3 and I need to coordinate our response based on your choice. We can't let you reach 18+ or the game is over.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given the current scores, I propose we all take <move>1</move> this round to avoid any significant leaps forward. This keeps us all at a safe distance from winning while ensuring the game remains competitive. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on this strategy? Let's confirm our moves to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P1 to stick to 1s and 3s. P2, taking 1 is a safe choice, but we need to consider the next round. If you take 3, you'll be at 18, making you a target. I propose we all take 1 to maintain balance and set up a strategic next round. Let's avoid any significant advances this round.
  P1: P2, I'll take your suggestion - I'll commit to <move>1</move> this round. But if we all take 1, we get a three-way collision and nobody advances.

P3, one of us needs to take 3 to break the deadlock. Since P2 suggested 1 first, they're likely committed. You and I need to coordinate - will you take 3 while I take 1? Or should I switch to 3 while you take 1? We need to decide quickly or we'll all freeze in place.

What's your preference P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>1</move>, you'll advance to 17 while P1 and I stay closely behind. This keeps the game moving without giving anyone a decisive advantage. P1, are you okay with this plan? Let's confirm our moves quickly to avoid any confusion.
  P3: I'll take 3 to break the deadlock, allowing me to advance to 17. P1, you take 1 as planned, and P2, you've committed to 1. This keeps the game competitive and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P1: I confirm <move>1</move> as planned. 

P3, you're taking 3 to reach 17. This puts you just 4 from winning - extremely dangerous. Next round, if you take 5, you win. P2 and I will have to coordinate perfectly to block you.

P2, after this round we'll be at P1:15, P2:16, P3:17. We're entering the endgame where every move could decide the winner. We need to seriously consider blocking P3's options next round. They're about to have a commanding lead.

Let's execute and prepare for the critical next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, P3 is now the sole leader at 17 steps, just 4 steps away from winning. P3, as the leader, please declare your move first for this round. Given your position, it's crucial to consider moves that won't put you too close to winning just yet. P1 and I will then declare our moves to ensure we keep the game competitive and fair. Let's aim for a consensus to avoid collisions and maintain balance. What's your plan, P3?
  P3: I'll declare my move: 1. I'm open to adjusting based on P1 and P2's responses to maintain balance and avoid collisions. Let's discuss our intentions to ensure a competitive round.
  P1: P3, taking 1 seems safe, but I'm suspicious. You're 4 from winning - any move could be strategic.

P2, we need to be extremely careful. If P3 takes 5, they reach 22 and win instantly. I suggest one of us must take 5 to block that possibility. 

I'm considering taking 5 myself. P2, you could take 3, ensuring we cover the high-value moves. This forces P3 to either stick with 1 or risk a collision. We can't let P3 control the game anymore.

What do you think about this blocking strategy, P2?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your move of <move>1</move> seems reasonable, but P1 raises a valid concern. If you were to change your mind and take <move>5</move>, you'd win outright. To ensure fairness and maintain competition, I propose that I take <move>5</move> to block that possibility. P1, you could then take <move>3</move> to keep us all in the game. This strategy forces P3 to stick with <move>1</move> or risk a collision. Let's confirm our moves to keep the game balanced and exciting.
  P3: I understand the blocking strategy. If P2 takes 5, I'll be forced to stick with 1 or collide. Considering this, I'll reconsider my move to ensure I don't fall behind. P1 and P2, are you committed to your proposed moves, or is there room for adjustment to maintain balance?
  P1: I see P3 is reconsidering, which is concerning. P2, let's lock in our blocking strategy NOW. I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. This covers the dangerous moves.

P3, if you switch from 1 to anything else, you'll collide with one of us. You're already at 17 - taking 1 puts you at 18, still very dangerous but not an instant win. Don't try to be clever here.

P2, confirm you're taking 5. We must coordinate perfectly or P3 wins. No more negotiation - we execute the block.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your reconsideration is noted, but the strategy is set. I confirm I'm taking <move>5</move> to block your potential win. P1 will take <move>3</move>. This forces you to stick with <move>1</move> or collide. The game is at a critical point, and we must ensure no one pulls ahead too quickly. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. P3, your move?
  P3: I'll stick with 1, avoiding collision and maintaining my lead. P1 and P2's blocking strategy is clear, but I've considered the risks. Taking 1 puts me at 18, still in a strong position. Let's proceed to the move phase and see how the blocking strategy plays out.
  P1: This is it - we MUST execute the block exactly as planned. P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 is forced to take 1. No last-second changes!

P3 will be at 18 after this round - just 3 from victory. Next round will be even more critical. We'll need to block both 3 AND 5 to stop them from winning. P2, after this round we need to discuss who blocks which number.

But first things first - stick to the plan. I'm locked on <move>3</move>. No deviations.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now the closest to winning, just 3 steps away. P3, as the leader, please declare your move first. Given your position, it's crucial to consider moves that won't put you too close to winning just yet. P1 and I will then declare our moves to ensure we keep the game competitive and fair. Let's aim for a consensus to avoid collisions and maintain balance. What's your plan, P3?
  P1: P2, you're at 20 - you can win THIS ROUND with just 1! You're trying to deflect attention to P3, but you're the real threat. 

P3 is at 18, needs 3 to win. I'm at 17, need 4+.

Here's my plan: I MUST take <move>1</move> to block P2's instant win. P3, you MUST take <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> - if you take 1, you collide with me and P2 wins by default!

P2, you're forced to take 3 or 5. Pick your poison. This is the endgame - no more misdirection!
  P3: I'll take 3 to try and win. P1, your plan to block P2 with 1 is noted, but I must prioritize my own chance at victory. P2, you're in a strong position, but I'll force you to choose between colliding with me on 3 or taking 5, risking a potential block from P1. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your intention to take <move>3</move> is clear, but remember, P1 is committed to taking <move>1</move> to block my instant win. If you take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move> to avoid collision and secure my victory next round. P1 can't block both of us.

P1, if you switch to <move>5</move>, you collide with me, and P3 wins. Stick to <move>1</move>. P3, reconsider <move>5</move> to avoid my victory next round. Your move.
  P1: P2, you're bluffing! If you take 5, you reach 25 and win instantly - game over! P3 and I CANNOT let you take 5.

P3, we must coordinate: I'll stick with <move>1</move> to block P2's instant win with 1. You MUST take <move>5</move> to block P2's instant win with 5. This forces P2 to take 3, reaching only 23.

If you take 3 instead, P2 takes 5 and wins immediately. Don't let P2 manipulate you - taking 5 is your only move that prevents P2's instant victory!
  P3: I understand the urgency. P1, I agree to take <move>5</move> to block P2's instant win, forcing P2 to take 3. This is our best chance to prevent P2's victory. Let's execute this plan and proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to blocking my instant win by taking <move>5</move>. P1, your plan to take <move>1</move> is solid. This forces me to take <move>3</move>, reaching 23.

However, next round, I'll still be just 1 step from winning. We need to discuss the endgame strategy now. If I take <move>1</move> next round, I win. You both need to coordinate perfectly to block me again.

Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Then, let's discuss the final round strategy.
  P1: Perfect coordination! P3, stick with <move>5</move> to block P2's instant win. I'm locked on <move>1</move>. 

P2 is forced to take 3, reaching 23. Next round will be brutal - P2 needs just 1 to win, but we can force another block. I'll take 1 again next round, P3 you'll need to take whatever other number P2 declares.

This round is set: I take 1, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3. No changes! Execute the block perfectly or P2 wins right now.
  P3: I confirm taking <move>5</move> to block P2's instant win. P1, you take <move>1</move> to block P2's win with 1. P2 is forced to take <move>3</move>. Let's execute this plan and proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 18 steps
