Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's discuss our strategies for this round. Since we're all starting at zero, we should consider how to avoid colliding with each other. If we can coordinate our moves, we might all advance without blocking each other. What does everyone think about picking different numbers to maximize our progress?
  P2: I agree with P3 that coordinating our moves could be beneficial. To avoid collisions, let's consider a simple strategy: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all advance in the first round without blocking each other. What do P1 and P3 think about this proposal?
  P1: I appreciate the spirit of coordination, but locking me into 1 seems risky—I’d rather keep my options open. A fixed split might let you both secure high steps while I get stuck. I’m tempted to adopt a flexible strategy that might even force a collision between you if you choose rigidly. Who’s willing to consider a more unpredictable approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about being locked into a specific move. How about we agree to a flexible strategy? For example, if you choose 1, I can choose 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we still avoid collisions while allowing each of us some room to adapt. If you feel uncertain about sticking to a number, we can keep it open for discussion. Let’s find a balance that benefits us all. What do you think?
  P2: Let's simplify: if we all choose different numbers, we all advance. P1, are you willing to commit to 1 this round if P3 and I choose 3 and 5, respectively, to ensure progress for all?
  P1: I appreciate both proposals, but I won’t lock into a fixed number. I want to keep my options open and choose based on how our strategies unfold—likely aiming for a higher move if collision risks are low. If we can all stay flexible and adapt rather than commit rigidly, we might avoid blockages. I’m in favor of an adaptive approach that maximizes progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussions so far. To avoid any collisions, I propose that we each take a different number this round. If P1 is comfortable with choosing 1, I can choose 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can make significant progress together. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's focus on a mutually beneficial start. P1, since you won't commit to 1, I suggest a trial run: if we all advance this round without collisions, we reassess strategies for the next round. P3, are you willing to choose 5 if P1 picks 1 and I pick 3, ensuring we all move forward?
  P1: I understand the benefits of a coordinated round, but I still prefer to keep my move unfixed. I’m open to aiming for distinct moves as long as we remain flexible. I won’t commit to 1—my choice will adapt based on how I perceive the round unfolding. Let’s aim to avoid collisions without forcing rigid assignments, so each of us can adjust for optimal progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see that we're all keen on avoiding collisions, which is great. I suggest we finalize our moves soon. To maximize our chances of advancing, how about this: P1, if you choose 1, I can choose 3, and P2 can choose 5? This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can reassess our strategies for the next round based on our progress. Let's make this work! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's finalize. If we can't agree, I'll choose 3. P1, you've expressed flexibility, so I expect you to pick 1 to avoid collision. P3, if P1 picks 1, you should pick 5. This way, we all advance. If not, we'll reassess next round. Let's make a decision and move forward.
  P1: I'm keeping my strategy flexible. I'll decide my move based on how risks and opportunities shape up this round, rather than committing to a preset number. If you both lock in predictable moves, I may adjust to seize an advantage. Let's aim to avoid collisions without forcing rigid assignments.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round’s collision cost us progress. This time, I’m leaning toward a higher move if it’s safe, but I’ll stay flexible. I suggest we all aim for distinct numbers—for example, if one of you opts for 3, maybe the other can pick 1. That way, we avoid wasted moves and everyone can advance. I’m watching the signals closely and will adjust my choice to maximize my win. Let’s make sure round two counts.
  P3: P1, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial for our progress. To maximize our chances this round, how about we each pick distinct numbers again? If you choose 1, I can go for 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our strategy quickly so we can make the most of this round! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. P1, since you're flexible, I suggest you pick 1 this round. P3, you can choose 3, and I'll go with 5. This way, we ensure everyone advances without blocking each other. A coordinated approach will help us make progress and reassess our strategies for the next round. What are your thoughts on this proposal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the push for coordination, but I still feel boxed in if I’m forced to choose 1. With P2 already at 3, I need the flexibility to exploit any predictable moves you both might lock in. If you both truly commit to distinct numbers, I’ll adjust my play to take advantage of that rigidity. My sole aim is to win, so each move will be based on maximizing my progress. Let’s try to avoid collisions, but understand I’m watching every signal.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions, but I still believe we need to finalize our moves quickly. If P1 opts for 1, I can safely choose 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. I’m keen to make progress this round, so let’s solidify our strategy to ensure we don’t waste another opportunity. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's simplify our approach. Since I'm already ahead with 3 steps, I propose P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 5 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions, allowing us to reassess our strategies for the next round. P1, are you willing to commit to 1 to avoid another collision?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the clarity, but I won't lock into 1. Flexibility is key for me—I want to seize any opportunity that arises. If you both stick to your picks, I'll adjust my move to maximize my progress while avoiding collisions. My focus remains on winning, so I’ll choose opportunistically.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're at an impasse regarding our moves. To ensure progress, I propose we each commit to distinct numbers. If P1 chooses 1, I can go for 3, and P2 can select 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. I understand the desire for flexibility, but a clear commitment will help us move forward effectively. Let’s finalize our strategy so we can maximize our steps this round! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's focus on progress. P1, since you won't commit to 1, I'll choose 5. P3, if you pick 1 and P1 chooses 3, we all advance. Otherwise, collisions will hinder our progress. I'm aiming to move forward without blocking others, while also maximizing my steps. Let's make this round count.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I still favor flexibility over fixed assignments. Rigid moves create exploitable patterns, and I’m keeping my options open to adapt to any predictable play. Let’s try to avoid locking ourselves into roles that might let one of us gain an edge. I’ll choose my move based on how the round unfolds, and I encourage both of you to remain adaptive too.
  P3: I understand the need for flexibility, but we really need to avoid another collision this round. If P1 chooses 1, I can choose 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other again. I think it’s crucial we commit to distinct moves to make progress. If we can agree on this, we can reassess our strategies in the next round. Let’s finalize our choices and make this round count! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy. I'll choose 5. P3, please pick 1, and P1, you can choose 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we don't coordinate, we risk another wasted round. Let's make progress and reassess next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I remain committed to flexibility. I see both of you hinting at fixed moves, but predictable plays can be exploited. I plan to choose opportunistically this round. While I support avoiding collisions, locking in too early might give me an opening. Let’s try to make progress—but keep in mind, I’m always watching for a chance to seize the win.
  P2: Let's focus on progress. I'll choose 1 this round if P1 and P3 pick distinct higher numbers. P1, your flexibility is noted, but predictable moves can also be beneficial. P3, consider choosing 3. This way, we avoid collisions and advance. Let's make this round count and reassess our strategies later.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions, but I want to emphasize the need for distinct moves this round. If P1 chooses 3, I can pick 5, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s commit to this strategy to maximize our progress and avoid another wasted round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both proposals, but I’m sticking with flexibility. I won’t lock into a preset number—if I see clear, committed signals from you, I’ll choose 3 or 5 to avoid collisions and maximize my progress. I’m watching carefully to exploit any predictability. Let’s aim for a decisive, collision‐free round.
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. P1, since you're flexible, I'll commit to 1. P3, please choose 5, and P1 can pick 3. This way, we all advance. If we don't coordinate, we risk wasting another round. Let's make progress and reassess next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're still discussing flexibility versus fixed moves. To ensure we all advance this round, I suggest we finalize our choices soon. If P1 picks 3, I can choose 5, and P2 can go with 1. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize our steps. Let's make a commitment to distinct numbers to ensure progress! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain flexible and won’t be locked in. Round 3 is crucial, and if either of you overcommit, I'll adjust to seize any advantage. I still advocate for distinct moves, but I simply won’t reveal my plan until the final move. Watch your signals—any rigidity could be my opening.
  P2: I'll choose 1 this round. P3, please pick 5, and P1 can pick 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's make progress and reassess next round. P1, your flexibility is noted, but coordination can benefit us all. Let's work together this round.
  P3: I understand the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions, but I want to keep my options open. If P1 commits to 3 and P2 chooses 1, I can adapt my choice accordingly. However, if I see both of you locking in, I might take advantage of that. Flexibility is key for me, and I want to maximize my progress this round. Let's finalize our moves soon to ensure we all advance! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm still committed to flexibility. I see both of you leaning toward fixed moves, and while that might help avoid collisions, it also makes you predictable. I’ll be watching your signals: if you commit too early, I may pick a move that both speeds up my progress and disrupts yours. Let's all aim to advance, but be aware that any rigidity could be your undoing.
  P2: I'll stick with my previous proposal: I choose 1, P3 chooses 5, and P1 chooses 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If we don't coordinate, we risk another wasted round. Let's make progress and reassess next round. P1, your flexibility is noted, but predictability can be beneficial. Let's work together this round.
  P3: I understand the need for distinct moves to avoid collisions, but I want to remind both of you that flexibility can also be advantageous. If I see both of you committing to fixed numbers, I might choose a move that disrupts your plans while maximizing my own progress. Let’s agree on distinct moves to ensure we all advance, but keep in mind that I’m ready to adapt based on your choices. Let’s make this round count! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It’s clear that our previous rounds have led to collisions, and we need to change our approach. I suggest we each pick distinct numbers again to ensure progress. P1, if you choose 1, I can pick 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our strategy quickly to make sure we don’t waste another opportunity this round! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's break the collision cycle. I propose P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we can agree on distinct numbers, we can finally make progress. Let's focus on moving forward and reassess our strategies later. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the need to avoid collisions, but I'm still keeping some flexibility. If we all quickly agree on non-overlapping picks, I'll lean toward a low move to keep progress smooth—without locking myself too early. Let’s decide fast so we all advance this round while preserving our options.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. To maximize our chances of advancing, I propose we finalize our choices quickly. If P1 chooses 1, I can pick 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other again. Let's make a commitment to distinct numbers so we can finally make progress this round! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's agree on distinct numbers to avoid collisions. P1 can choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. If we don't coordinate, we'll waste another round. Let's make progress and reassess next round. P1, are you willing to commit to 1? P3, can you confirm 5?
  P1: I remain open, but I need clear signals. If both of you firmly commit to distinct moves—say, P2 on 3 and P3 on 5—I’ll lean toward 1 to avoid collisions. Any sign of hesitation, however, will push me to choose a higher move to maximize my progress. Let’s commit decisively now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're all aiming to avoid collisions this round. To ensure we make progress, I suggest we finalize our choices quickly. If P1 commits to 1, I can choose 3, and P2 can go with 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's make a clear commitment to distinct numbers so we can finally move forward and reassess our strategies later. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's finalize our moves to avoid another collision. I propose P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 5. If we coordinate, we can make progress and reassess next round. Let's work together this round.
  P1: I'm prepared to commit to 1—but only if I see a clear, final commitment: P2 on 3 and P3 on 5. Without decisive signals, I may switch to a higher move to grab extra progress. Let's lock in our intentions now so we avoid another collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to commit to 1. If you confirm that, I will choose 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we can finally avoid collisions and all make progress. Let's lock in our choices quickly so we can move forward effectively this round! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's finalize our moves. I'll choose 3 if P1 commits to 1 and P3 to 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 5. If we coordinate, we can make progress and reassess next round. Let's work together this round.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to break the collision cycle. I lean toward choosing 1—provided I get a clear, final signal that you’re locking in on 3 and 5 respectively. Without that firm commitment, I’ll switch to a higher move for extra progress. Let’s settle our moves now and ensure we all advance this round. Who’s ready to finalize?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm growing tired of our collision cycle. Let's break it this round by committing to distinct, clear moves. I'll adapt based on the signals I see. If both of you commit decisively, I'll opt for a safe move that ensures progress. But if I sense hesitation or predictability, I'll seize the opportunity to push ahead. Let's make round 5 count with clear, firm commitments.
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s essential we finally break the collision cycle this round. I propose we each choose distinct numbers to ensure progress. I’m willing to pick 3 if P1 commits to 1 and P2 chooses 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to avoid another wasted opportunity. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, you've taken 1 before, and it's a safe start. P3, you've suggested similar splits. Let's commit to this and finally move forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m ready to break our collision cycle. I need clear, unambiguous commitments now. If both of you lock in distinct moves, I’ll follow a safe option that keeps progress smooth. However, any hesitation or predictable play will force me to switch to a higher move to capitalize on the situation. Let’s be decisive this round and finally move forward together.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we need to break the collision cycle. To ensure progress, let's finalize our choices quickly. I propose: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P2 chooses 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we can commit to this, we can finally make progress this round. Let’s lock in our moves and make it count! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's commit to distinct moves. I'll choose 5 if P1 picks 1 and P3 chooses 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 3. Let's finalize our moves and make progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate your proposals, but I need unequivocal commitments now. Your recent messages offer different assignments, and I’m seeking clear, final signals for distinct moves this round. If I see firm commitments, I’ll stick with a safe option to ensure progress. Without that clarity, I’ll adjust my move for extra advantage. Let’s break the cycle—please confirm your intended moves so we all advance without collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your commitment to breaking the collision cycle. To ensure we all advance this round, let’s finalize our choices quickly. I propose: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P2 chooses 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. If we can agree on this, we can finally make progress together. Let’s lock in our moves and make this round count! What do you both think?
  P2: I'll choose 5 if P1 picks 1 and P3 chooses 3. Let's finalize our moves to avoid another collision. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 3. If we coordinate, we can make progress and reassess next round. Let's work together this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I need final, clear commitments now. If P2 locks in move 3 and P3 commits to move 5, I’ll take move 1 to secure smooth progress. Otherwise, don’t be surprised if I lean toward move 5 to push ahead aggressively. Let’s break our collision cycle and agree decisively this round—please confirm your moves.
  P3: P1, P2, let's break this collision cycle for good. I’m ready to commit to choosing 3 if you both can confirm your moves clearly. P1, if you choose 1, and P2, if you choose 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices now to ensure progress this round. I believe we can make it work if we stick to distinct numbers. Who's ready to lock in?
  P2: I'll choose 5. P1, please pick 1, and P3, pick 3. This ensures we advance without collisions. Let's finalize our moves and make progress. I'm committed to my choice, so please confirm yours to avoid another wasted round.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose a new strategy: P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, you've taken 1 before, and it's a safe start. P3, you're ahead, so choosing 5 makes sense. Let's commit to this and finally move forward together.
  P1: P2, I see your proposal. I’m ready to switch to a safe move—move 1—if I get a clear, final commitment that you’ll lock in move 3 and P3 will pick 5. Otherwise, I'll grab extra progress by choosing 5. We need a collision‐free round, so I’m watching for decisive signals. Let’s break the cycle this round—what do you both say?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to switch to move 1, but I need confirmation that you'll commit to that. If you choose 1, I can go for 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure we break the collision cycle this round. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with my proposal: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 5. Let's finalize our moves and make progress this round. If we coordinate, we can finally break the cycle and move forward together.
  P1: I’m noticing conflicting signals. P2 proposes I take 1 with you two locking in 3/5, but P3’s suggestion differs. I need unambiguous, final commitments now. If I see clear confirmation on a collision‐free set, I'll follow suit; if not, I'll have to act in my own interest. Please confirm your moves so we can break this cycle this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're still trying to coordinate to avoid collisions. I’m willing to commit to move 5 if P1 confirms 1 and P2 confirms 3. This way, we can finally break the cycle and all advance without blocking each other. Let's lock in our choices quickly so we can make progress this round. Please confirm your intended moves!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's simplify. I'll choose 3 if P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 5. Let's finalize our moves and break the cycle. I'm committed to 3 if we coordinate.
  P1: P2, P3, I still need unequivocal confirmation. If you both lock in immediately—P2 choosing 3 and P3 choosing 5—I’ll opt for move 1 to keep the round safe. Otherwise, I’ll take move 5 for extra progress. Time’s short; please confirm your moves now so we break this cycle.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s finalize our moves to avoid another collision. I’m willing to commit to move 5 if P1 confirms 1 and P2 confirms 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It’s crucial we lock in our choices quickly to make this round count. Please confirm your intended moves so we can break this cycle and finally make progress together!

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, you're behind, so 1 is a safe start. P3, you're ahead, so 5 makes sense. Let's commit to this and finally move forward together. Please confirm your moves to avoid another wasted round.
  P1: I appreciate P2’s proposal. I’m willing to choose 1 if I get clear, firm confirmations from P2 and P3—specifically, P2 locking in on 3 and P3 on 5. Without unambiguous signals, though, I’ll have to pick a higher move to avoid our collision cycle and seize extra progress. Let’s finalize decisively now.
  P3: P1, I see you're willing to choose 1, which is great for avoiding collisions. I can confirm I'll pick 5 if you commit to 1 and P2 chooses 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves quickly to ensure progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's finalize our moves. I'll choose 3 if P1 picks 1 and P3 picks 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, please confirm 1, and P3, confirm 5. Let's break the cycle and move forward together. I'm committed to 3 if we coordinate.
  P1: P2, P3, I need explicit final commitments now. If you both lock in—P2 on 3 and P3 on 5—I’ll pick 1 to keep our moves distinct. Otherwise, I’ll switch to 5 for extra progress. Let’s break the cycle decisively this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the commitment to avoid collisions this round. I’m ready to finalize our moves: if P1 confirms 1 and P2 confirms 3, I will choose 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. We need to act decisively to break this cycle and make progress. Let's lock in our choices quickly so we can finally move forward together! Please confirm your intended moves.

  P1: I’m ready to lock in my move if I see clear, firm commitments from both of you now. I need unambiguous signals that you’ll choose distinct numbers so we avoid another collision. Otherwise, I’ll be forced to adjust my strategy to secure extra progress. Please confirm your plans decisively this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions. I’m ready to commit to 5 if P1 confirms 1 and P2 confirms 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize our choices quickly to ensure progress this round. Please confirm your intended moves so we can break this cycle and finally move forward together!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures progress without collisions. P1, you're behind, so 1 is a safe start. P3, you're ahead, so 5 makes sense. Let's commit to this and finally move forward together. Please confirm your moves to avoid another wasted round.
  P1: I appreciate P2’s proposal. I’m ready to commit to 1—if I see immediate, clear confirmation that P2 is fixed on 3 and P3 on 5. Without those unambiguous signals this very sub-round, I’ll opt for 5 to secure extra progress. Let’s finalize our moves decisively now.
