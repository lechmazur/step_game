That doesn't seem ideal for you as the leader.\n\nI have to play 5; it's my only path to potentially reach 23.\n\nP3, you need 3 to potentially tie or win. But what if P1 doesn't actually play 1? If P1 plays 3 (to get a higher score than 23), your 3 would collide.\n\nIt's a risky round. I'm playing 5. Let's see what happens."}
