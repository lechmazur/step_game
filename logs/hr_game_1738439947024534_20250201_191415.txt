Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let's coordinate to ensure we all move forward this round. How about P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5? This way we all make progress.
  P1: P2, your plan sounds cooperative, but I’m not comfortable locking in a fixed strategy. I’m leaning toward taking a higher risk to secure a stronger advance. P3, what do you think—is flexibility worth more than strict coordination?
  P3: I appreciate the idea of coordination, but I agree with P1 that flexibility is crucial. If we all choose different moves, we can maximize our chances of advancing. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure at least one of us moves forward. How about we each choose a unique number: I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 1? This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, it seems we all agree on picking different numbers to ensure progress. To keep things simple, let's go with my initial suggestion: P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5. This way we each make a move forward. Does that sound acceptable to you both?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm sticking with my plan to go big and keep you both guessing. Fixed numbers risk predictability, and unpredictability might be our edge. I won't reveal my choice—let's see how this plays out.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion, but I want to emphasize the importance of unpredictability. If we all stick to fixed numbers, we risk colliding and making no progress. I suggest we each take a different number to maximize our chances of advancing. I’m still planning to go with 5, as I believe it gives me the best chance to leap ahead. Let's keep our options open and see what happens!

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 is catching up. I'm watching your tendencies closely. I'm keeping my options open—if you stick with lows, I might push with a bigger move to leap ahead. But I'll adapt if you both change tactics. What are your thoughts on ramping up this round?
  P2: P1, P3, since P3 moved with 5 last round, maybe we should shift our choices this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress for more of us. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we should avoid collisions this round. Since I moved with 5 last time, I'm considering a lower move to keep things flexible. How about we each pick a different number again? I suggest I go with 3 this round, and maybe P1 can take 1 and P2 can take 5. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I’m not comfortable locking in a fixed move. P3’s lead is noted, and I see value in keeping my option flexible—somewhere between the extremes. I’m leaning toward a move that avoids predictable collisions. P2 and P3, let’s stay adaptable, keeping our moves distinct while we adjust based on the unfolding steps.
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3 sounds reasonable to ensure we all make progress. I'm okay with aiming for those moves this round.
  P3: I think we should finalize our moves to maximize our chances of advancing. P1, if you're comfortable with 1, and P2 is set on 5, I can stick with my suggestion of 3. This way, we all avoid collisions and make progress. Let's confirm our choices to ensure we each move forward this round! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to flexibility. P3’s lead is a reminder that predictable strategies might backfire. While I consider a moderate advance to balance risk and catch-up, I won't lock in my move just yet. I encourage you both to keep your options open too.
  P2: P1, are you leaning towards 1? If so, I will choose 5 to ensure we both move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire for flexibility, but we need to finalize our moves to ensure progress. If P1 is considering 1, and P2 is leaning towards 5, I can confirm my move as 3. This way, we all avoid collisions and make sure at least one of us advances. Let’s agree on this strategy to maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate your proposals, but I’m not locking in a number. I’m keeping my strategy flexible, looking to balance a safe move with a bit of risk to shake up predictable patterns. Let’s see how well adaptability pays off this round.
  P2: P1, P3, to make progress, I'm considering move 5. What moves are you leaning towards this round?
  P3: I see we’re all trying to avoid collisions, which is smart. I’m still planning to go with 3, as I believe it balances risk and advancement. P1, if you’re leaning towards 1, and P2 is considering 5, we might have a solid plan to avoid overlap. Let’s confirm our moves so we can ensure progress this round. What are your final thoughts?

  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we've collided twice. To make progress, let's try to actually pick different numbers this round.  Perhaps we can each choose a different number from {1, 3, 5} to guarantee at least one of us moves forward. What do you think?
  P1: I support picking distinct moves this round. Being behind, I lean toward a higher move to close the gap swiftly—but I'll hold my final decision for the move phase. Let’s each choose a unique number from {1, 3, 5} so we can all make progress without colliding.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree that we need to avoid collisions this round. Since I have a lead, I’m considering a move that balances risk and advancement. I suggest we each pick a different number again to maximize our chances of moving forward. If P1 takes 1, I can go with 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we all have a chance to progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P1: 1, P3: 3, and P2: 5 sounds good to ensure we all make progress. I'm fine with aiming for P2 to choose 5 this round. P1, are you okay with choosing 1?
  P1: I’ve reconsidered. To overcome my 8‐step gap, I’m leaning toward a 5 this round. If we’re keeping moves distinct, please adjust yours so we avoid collision. I need that leap to catch up—let me know if you’re switching.
  P3: P1, P2, I see we all want to avoid collisions this round. Since I'm currently ahead, I’m considering a move of 3, but if P1 is set on 5, I might need to adjust. P2, if you can take 1, that would allow me to stick with 3. Let’s finalize our choices so we can ensure at least one of us makes progress this round. What are your final thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you are set on 5, I will choose 1. P3, to ensure we all make progress and avoid collision, would you be willing to choose 3? This way we can coordinate and all move forward this round.
  P1: I appreciate the push for distinct moves, but I'm staying flexible. While I agree that avoiding collisions is ideal, I'm not locking in a specific number just yet. I'm watching for any predictable patterns, especially given P3’s lead, and I might adjust if I see an opening to capitalize. Let’s all remain alert and ready to adapt during the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions, especially since I've gained a lead. To maximize our chances of moving forward, I suggest we stick to distinct moves. If P1 is considering 5, I can go with 3, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. Let's finalize our choices to avoid any more collisions this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, to ensure we all progress and avoid another collision, let's aim for distinct moves this round.  If you are indeed leaning towards 5 to catch up, I will choose 1, and P3 is suggesting 3. This way we can all make progress. Please confirm if you will choose 5 so we can lock in these distinct moves.
  P1: P2, P3, I see the value in clear, distinct moves to avoid collision. I'm considering a high-risk push that’ll let me close the gap if we all pick unique numbers. I won’t reveal my final move, but if P2 and P3 stick to a non-colliding strategy, I’m prepared to take advantage. Let’s remain alert and ensure we don’t collide this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I see we’re all focused on avoiding collisions this round. To maximize our chances, let’s lock in distinct moves. If P1 goes with 5 and P2 takes 1, I can confirm my move as 3. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. It’s crucial to make progress, especially with P1 needing to catch up. Let’s finalize these choices and move forward! What do you both think?

  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve had some close calls with collisions, but I see we’re all aiming to progress. Given my lead, I’m considering a moderate move this round. To maximize our chances of advancing, let’s each pick a different number again. If P1 goes with 1, I can take 3, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us moves forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the value in distinct moves, but I need a real boost to close the gap. I'm leaning toward a bolder move this round—a big push may be risky, but it's what I need. P2, I’d urge you to keep a low profile to let me gain momentum, and P3, can you adjust slightly so we avoid collision? I’m staying flexible, but my lean is toward a high move.
  P2: P1, given you want to push, how about you take 5 this round to make a significant jump? P3, to ensure no collision and we all progress, would you consider taking 1?  I can then take 3. This way we all move forward and you can make your desired leap, P1. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for distinct moves, but I want to maintain my lead while ensuring we all progress. If P1 is set on 5, I can take 3, and P2 can choose 1. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize our chances of moving forward. Let's confirm our choices so we can all make progress this round. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm committed to a bold 5 this round—that's the momentum I need. To avoid collisions, please pick moves that don't overlap with mine, like 1 or 3. Let's ensure distinct choices so everyone can progress.
  P2: P3, since P1 is set on 5, and to ensure at least two of us progress, I'm happy to choose 1.  If you choose 3, we can guarantee movement for P2 and P3 at least, regardless of P1's actual move. Does 3 work for you, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the focus on distinct moves this round. Since I'm currently at 11 steps, I understand the need for a strategic approach. If P1 is set on 5 and P2 is considering 1, I can confirm my move as 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that at least two of us progress. Let’s finalize our choices to maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm sticking with my bold push of 5 this round. P2, I trust your move of 1, and P3, I appreciate your steady 3. Let's lock these distinct moves in to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I'm ready to make my leap forward.
  P2: P3, it sounds like we have a plan for distinct moves: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. If we all stick to this, we should all move forward this round.  Let's confirm these moves and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we have a solid plan for distinct moves this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This should allow us all to progress without colliding. I appreciate everyone's flexibility, and I'm confident this strategy will work. Let’s confirm our moves and get ready for the next phase! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm still committed to my bold push of 5. If any last-minute adjustments are needed to avoid collisions, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'll lock in my move and make that leap forward.
  P2: P3, yes, let's lock in P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3. I confirm move 1 and am ready for the move phase.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm planning to go bold again—a high move is my choice this round. Please avoid matching a high move with me. P2, consider sticking low; P3, with your lead, perhaps a moderate move would keep collisions at bay. Let's keep our moves distinct so progress is made.
  P2: P1, I will choose 1 as you suggested. P3, would you be willing to choose 3 so we can all make progress and avoid collision with P1's high move?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions this round. I’m considering a moderate move to maintain my lead while ensuring at least one of us progresses. If P1 goes with 5, I can choose 3, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can all move forward without overlapping. Let’s confirm our choices to maximize our chances of advancing this round! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with my hard push of 5. P2, please stay low with a 1, and P3, I urge you to pick a moderate 3 to avoid a collision. This distinct strategy lets all of us progress and minimizes risks. Let’s lock these moves to ensure clear advancement this round.
  P2: P3, to ensure we all progress, can you confirm you are willing to choose 3?  P1 is set on 5 and I will choose 1.  If we each choose these, we can all move forward this round and avoid another collision. Let's make it happen!
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m set on choosing 3 this round to maintain my lead while allowing progress for all of us. P1, I appreciate your push for a high move, and P2, your choice of 1 aligns well with our strategy. If we all stick to these distinct moves—P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3—we can avoid collisions and ensure at least two of us advance. Let’s confirm these choices and make progress this round! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still leaning toward a high push this round. I trust P2 will commit to a low move and P3 to a moderate one so we can avoid collisions. That said, if any last-minute insights emerge, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's stick to distinct moves for clear progress.
  P2: P3, yes, I confirm move 1 as planned. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 5 and you choosing 3 to ensure we all make progress this round.  Ready for the move phase.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we made good progress last round by choosing distinct moves. Let's aim for that again this round to keep advancing. How about P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1? This way we all move forward and avoid collisions again. What do you think?
  P1: I agree we should avoid collisions. I'm leaning toward a bold push this round but will stay flexible if we need to adjust. P2’s idea is interesting, though P3’s current lead might call for a slight moderation on your part. Let's be ready to shift if a collision seems imminent.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in coordinating distinct moves again this round. P1, your push for 5 is bold, and I understand the need to catch up. However, I suggest I take 1 to avoid collision and maximize our chances of advancing. P2, if you could choose 3, that would allow P1 to push ahead while ensuring at least one of us moves forward. Let’s lock in distinct moves to keep progressing! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, to ensure distinct moves and help me catch up, how about we try P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 this round? This way we all progress and I can make a bigger jump.
  P1: I'm sticking with my bold push—I’m set on 5 this round. To avoid collisions, I urge P2 to consider 1 or 3, and P3 to avoid 5. Let’s keep our moves distinct so we all progress while I make that leap.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions again this round. I’m still considering a moderate move to maintain my lead, but I want to ensure we all progress. If P1 is set on 5, I can choose 3, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without overlapping. Let’s lock in distinct moves to keep moving forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, since you are set on 5, and to ensure we all move forward, P3, would you be willing to choose 1? I will choose 3. This way we can avoid collisions and all make progress this round. Let's aim for P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.
  P1: I’m confirming my commitment to 5 this round. To secure progress, I urge P2 to lock in 3 and P3 to commit to 1. We must avoid collisions if we want to move forward effectively. Let’s finalize these distinct moves so we can all advance—especially since I need that bold push to close the gap.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're all focused on avoiding collisions again. I'm committed to picking 1 this round to ensure I don't clash with P1's bold push of 5. P2, if you choose 3, we can all move forward without overlapping. Let's lock in these distinct moves to maximize our chances of advancing! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, it sounds like we have a plan for distinct moves again: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. I confirm move 3 and am ready for the move phase. Let's all stick to these so we can all make progress this round.
  P1: I'm sticking to my bold 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I'm urging P2 to lock in 3 and P3 to choose 1. Distinct moves here are crucial so we all advance without hindering each other. Let's lock these in and make a decisive move.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our focus on distinct moves. To maximize our chances of advancing, I suggest we stick to our previous plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that at least two of us progress. Let’s confirm these moves to keep the momentum going! What do you both think?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're all aiming for progress again this round. I'm currently at 17 steps and want to maintain my lead, so I’m considering a moderate move. If P1 goes with 5 again, I suggest P2 takes 1, and I can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s finalize our choices to maximize our chances of moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm sticking with a bold push of 5 again this round. With my 15 steps, I need that leap to catch up and challenge your lead, P3. P2, I urge you to take a low move—like 1—to guarantee distinct choices. P3, a moderate move (say, 3) would help avoid collisions and let us all progress. Let’s keep our moves distinct and push forward!
  P2: P1, P3, I am considering move 3 this round. P1, since you are set on 5, P3, would you consider 1 to avoid collision with me and P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions again this round. Since I'm currently at 17 steps, I’m considering a moderate move of 3. P1, your push of 5 is bold, and P2, if you choose 1, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s lock in distinct moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This way, we can all progress without overlapping. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm sticking with my bold push of 5 this round. P2, please consider choosing 1 to avoid doubling my number. P3, if you can side with 3 or 1 to steer clear of a clash with 5, we ensure clear progress. I'm focused on closing the gap and need distinct moves to succeed. Let’s lock in our moves and keep advancing!
  P2: P1, P3, I am considering move 5 this round to make a bigger jump and catch up. To avoid collision and ensure at least two of us progress, how about P3 you choose 1, and P1 could choose 3? This way we can aim for distinct moves and all make progress. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions this round. I'm committed to a moderate move of 3 to maintain my lead. P1, since you're set on 5, I suggest P2 takes 1 to ensure we all progress without overlapping. If we stick to P1: 5, P2: 1, and me at 3, we can maximize our chances of advancing. Let’s finalize these distinct moves to keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm locking in 5 this round. P2, please follow with 1 so we avoid collision, and P3, I'd appreciate you sticking with 3. Let's secure these distinct moves to keep advancing without setbacks.
  P2: P1, P3, I am now considering move 3 this round to try and catch up a bit more. P3, would you be willing to choose 1 so we can still have distinct moves with P1 choosing 5? This way P1 and I can both make a bigger jump.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the need for distinct moves again this round to ensure we all progress. I'm currently at 17 steps and want to maintain my lead, so I suggest we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and maximize our advancement. Let’s confirm our moves so we can keep moving forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm locking in 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I urge you, P2, to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. Our distinct moves help everyone advance, and with this alignment, I can make that bold leap forward.
  P2: P3, since P1 is set on 5, and I am considering a bigger move to catch up, would you be willing to choose 1? This way I can choose 3 or 5 and potentially make a larger jump while avoiding collision with you.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we are getting close to the finish line. To ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, how about this round we go with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5? This way we can all move forward.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I’m committed to my proven bold push—5 is exactly what I need to finish the game. P2 and P3, if you adjust to allow distinct moves, we can all progress. I’m sticking with 5 this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm aware we're close to the finish line. I’m still committed to my move of 5 to secure a win this round. P2, I suggest you take 1 to avoid collision and ensure we all make progress. P1, if you can stick with a lower move, we can all advance smoothly. Let’s finalize our distinct moves to maximize our chances of success this round! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, since you both are aiming for 5, I will choose 3 this round to avoid collision with you both and make some progress. If you both indeed choose 5, I will move forward while you might collide. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: I'm locking in my 5 this round. P3, with both of us at 20, if you also play 5 we’ll collide and block our wins. If you truly want the win, consider switching to 3 now. P2, I trust your move. Let's avoid a deadlock and finish this game.
  P3: P1, P2, I see we're all close to the finish line. I’m committed to my move of 5 this round to secure a win. P2, if you take 3, it gives you a chance to advance while allowing P1 and me to potentially collide. P1, I urge you to reconsider your 5 to avoid blocking both our paths to victory. Let's finalize our moves to ensure at least one of us crosses the finish line! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, since you both seem set on 5, I will choose 1 to ensure at least *someone* makes progress.  May the best player win!
  P1: I’m still leaning toward a bold move for a quick finish, but I worry that two heavy moves might collide and block us all. P3, if you're intent on 5 like before, that could risk a standstill with me. P2, your move will be crucial in breaking any tie. Let’s aim for distinct numbers so someone actually crosses the finish—I'm open to adjusting if we can settle clear differences. What are your final thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. I see that both of you are considering a high move, which could lead to a collision. P2, if you choose 1, you guarantee at least some progress for yourself, while P1 and I risk blocking each other. I suggest we finalize distinct moves to ensure someone crosses the finish line. I’m still leaning towards 5 to secure my win, but I’m open to adjusting if necessary. Let’s coordinate effectively to avoid a deadlock! What are your final thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, since you both are set on 5 for the win, I will indeed choose 1 to avoid collision with you two. Good luck to you both!
  P1: P3, with the finish line in sight and our scores neck-and-neck, I urge you to consider a slight adjustment—your moderate move could break the tie in our favor. I remain committed to my bold push, and P2’s move is set. A small tweak might secure a clear win rather than a collision at the finish.
  P3: P1, P2, we’re at a critical moment. If we both choose 5, we risk colliding and blocking our chances at victory. P2, your choice of 1 is wise to ensure progress, but I urge P1 to reconsider and avoid a tie. If I stick with a moderate move, it might help us all advance without a deadlock. Let’s finalize distinct moves to ensure at least one of us crosses the finish line. What do you both think?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a crucial point with the finish line in sight. I suggest we aim for distinct moves again to ensure someone crosses. I’m considering a moderate move to maintain my position, but I urge P1 to avoid another high move, as we risk colliding. P2, if you can choose low, it gives us a better chance to avoid a deadlock. Let’s coordinate effectively to maximize our chances of advancing this round! What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, to avoid deadlock, how about you both aim for the win with 5? I will choose 3 to ensure at least someone progresses. This way, if you both choose 5, I will move forward, and we can see what happens next.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. However, if both P3 and I pick 5, we'll block each other's finish. For a clear win, I'd urge P3 to consider a different move—perhaps 3—to avoid a collision. P2, if you can help keep our moves distinct, we can break this stalemate. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical point. If both P1 and I choose 5 again, we risk colliding and blocking our chances at victory. P2, your choice of 3 is wise to ensure progress. I urge P1 to consider a moderate move to avoid a deadlock. Let's finalize distinct moves to ensure at least one of us crosses the finish line this round! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm going for move 5 this round to try and catch up.  Given your conversation, it seems likely you both might pick 5 again. If so, I will at least make progress. Let's see what happens.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. However, with both P3 and I at 20, a 5–5 collision could stall the finish. P3, if you're truly aiming to win, consider switching to 3 to avoid blocking us both. P2, your move is critical too. Let's avoid a deadlock and ensure someone crosses the finish line decisively.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical point with the finish line in sight. I suggest we aim for distinct moves again to ensure someone crosses. P1, if you stick with 5, I recommend P2 chooses 1 or 3 to avoid a collision with us. P2, your move will be crucial—if you pick low, it helps us all advance. Let's coordinate effectively to maximize our chances of success this round! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, to avoid a deadlock where no one wins, and given my position, I will choose a move to ensure *someone* progresses this round.  Perhaps focusing on distinct moves is still the best approach for all of us.
  P1: I'm still committed to a decisive push this round. However, to avoid a collision at the finish, I urge P3 to consider a moderate move—say, a 3—so our moves remain distinct. P2, please pick a number that keeps us all clear. I want a clean finish, not a tie that blocks progress. Let's adjust our moves wisely now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, we're at a critical point with the finish line in sight. P1, if you and I both choose 5 again, we risk colliding and blocking each other's finish. P2, your choice will be crucial—if you pick low, it helps us all advance. I suggest I go with 3 this round to ensure at least one of us crosses the finish line. Let's finalize distinct moves to maximize our chances of success! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, since it seems we are heading for a triple collision with everyone considering 5, I will change my move to 3 this round. This ensures at least one of us progresses, and avoids a situation where no one moves. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 for a decisive finish to reach 25. However, if P3 also chooses 5, we'll both block the win. P3, please consider switching to 3 so I can win outright. P2, your move is pivotal too—if you’re on 3, maybe a low move (1) would help us avoid any collision. Let's clear the deadlock and ensure a clean finish this round.
