Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's get this started. I'm aiming high and picking 5 this round. Just letting you know.
  P2: P1, I highly doubt you'll actually choose 5.  I'm going with 3.  P3, what's your plan?
  P3: I don’t trust either of you. Picking 5 right away sounds risky, but maybe it’s worth a shot. Then again, colliding with someone on the first turn would be a total waste. Let’s see if we can avoid stepping on each other’s toes, but no promises.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, doubt all you want. It makes sense to go for the biggest jump early on. If you stick to 3 and P3 picks 1, we all move. If someone collides, well, that's the game. I'm sticking with my plan.
  P2: Okay, P3, how about you go for 1, I'll stick with 3, and P1 can do whatever they want.  That way at least two of us advance.  If P1 *actually* picks 5, they get a head start, but I doubt it.  This seems like the most logical start.
  P3: I’m not convinced either of you will do what you say. If P1 really goes for 5, that’s bold but risky. P2 seems clever, but I’m wary of being set up. I might pick 1, or maybe I’ll jump to 5 myself. Let’s see if we can avoid a collision... if that’s even possible.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 seems quite eager for you to pick 1. Are they really planning on 3, or just trying to ensure *they* don't collide? Could they even be aiming for 5 themselves? It's tricky. My plan hasn't changed much, the big jump early on still feels right.
  P2: P3, if you choose 1, and I choose 3, and P1 *does* choose 5, they get a huge advantage.  I'm now leaning towards 1.  P1, are you *really* going for 5?  Last chance to coordinate.  If we all pick different numbers, we all advance.
  P3: Let’s spread out to avoid messing each other up. I’m fine taking the smallest step if you two commit to 3 and 5. But if anyone’s lying, collisions will hurt us all. Let’s try for a clean start.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, nice move grabbing 5 while P1 and I collided.  I'm going for 5 this round. P1, if you go for 1, we all move. If you go for 3, you risk colliding with me.  Let's try to avoid collisions this time.
  P1: P2, you're already ahead and now you want the biggest jump (5) while I take the smallest (1)? That doesn't sound like a great deal for me or P3. Given you switched from 3 to 1 last round, your claim of taking 5 now seems questionable. I need to catch up, so 5 looks appealing to me as well. P3, letting P2 run away with a lead doesn't seem smart for either of us. What's your take?
  P3: P2, you’re already a step ahead—expecting us to pick smaller moves so you can take 5 again is unreasonable. P1, we should deny P2 a free jump. If we both choose 5, P2 either collides and gains nothing or picks something smaller, letting us catch up or pull ahead. Let’s discourage P2 from dominating so soon.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concern. How about this: I'll go for 3. P1, you take 1, and P3 can take 5.  That way we all advance. If either of you betray this plan, we'll be back to collisions. Let's make some progress.
  P1: P2, that's a quick change of plans. Your new proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 significantly in the lead. Why would you suggest that, especially after P3 just took 5? It feels like you're trying to manipulate P3 or me.

P3, P2's offer seems too good to be true for you. Are you trusting this sudden generosity?

I need points, and 1 point feels too slow. 5 still looks like the best way to catch up, despite the risks. P2 suggesting 3 now just adds another layer of potential collision.
  P3: P2’s offer sounds enticing for me, but the sudden shift is suspicious. P1, you’re at zero—picking only 1 keeps you behind both of us. I want to move forward without colliding. If P2 truly goes 3 and P1 truly goes 1, I’m open to 5. But if anyone lies, it backfires. Let’s finalize something clear: no collisions, or we all lose ground.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm serious about 3.  I'm trying to avoid another collision. If you both go for 5, neither of you move, and I get a free 3 steps.  If one of you picks 1, that person moves, I move, and the other is stuck at zero.  Do you really want to risk staying at zero?  Let's all move forward this round.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) leaves me way behind while P3 gets a huge lead and you advance steadily. That doesn't work for me. P3, taking 5 now might paint a target on your back later.

How about this alternative: I take 5 (I need to catch up from 0), P2 takes 1 (you're already ahead), and P3 takes 3?
Scores would become P1=5, P2=2, P3=3. We all move, and it's more balanced. What do you say?
  P3: P1, your proposal (you:5, P2:1, me:3) sounds somewhat fair. If we all stick to it, nobody collides, and we evenly catch up. But I’m still concerned about last-minute deceptions. If either of you breaks the deal and picks 3 or 5 instead, I’ll gain nothing again. Are we truly committed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 already has the lead. If we let them keep jumping ahead unchallenged, it’s bad for both of us. I’m thinking of picking 5 this round—I need to catch up. But if P1 also picks 5, we collide. P2, maybe you should pick 5 with me to discourage P1 from attempting a big jump. If P1 plays smaller, both of us gain ground. Let’s figure out a way to prevent P1 from running away.
  P2: P3, teaming up on P1 makes sense. I'll go for 5 with you. P1, if you pick 5, none of us move.  Choose 1 or 3 and let us catch up.  If you go for 1, I'll consider going for 3 next round to keep things balanced.  Let's make this a real competition.
  P1: P2 and P3, interesting plan to coordinate with 5 against me. It's a bold move, but relies entirely on trust. If one of you picks 3 while the other picks 5, the one picking 5 gets nothing. P2, you changed your mind last round. P3, are you sure P2 will stick to 5 this time?

As the leader, maybe playing it safe with 1 or 3 is smarter for me anyway. But if you both collide on 5, that works for me too. Good luck trusting each other.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, interesting that you suggested coordinating on 5 last round but then chose 3. P2, you're now slightly ahead.

Since I'm behind P2, I need to catch up, so 5 is looking necessary for me. What are you two thinking? Perhaps P2 takes 1 (playing it safe with the lead) and P3 takes 3? If I take 5, we'd all advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm aiming for 3 this round. P1, if you choose 5, we risk a collision.  P3, if you go for 1, we all move forward cleanly.  Let's avoid collisions and keep the game moving.  This puts us at P1=11, P2=10, P3=7 if we all cooperate.
  P3: P2, I’m wary of always picking the smallest steps and staying behind. If you take 3 and I take 1, P1 could jump to 5 and widen the gap. I’d prefer a move that helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. P1, are you really set on 5 again? Or can we coordinate so that we all advance without giving anyone a massive lead?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're right to be wary of taking 1. P2's plan isn't great for you. P2, claiming 3 seems self-serving, especially since you're in the lead. I need to close the gap, so 5 remains my intention. P3, given P2 claims 3 and I'm aiming for 5, what's your best move to avoid being left behind? Maybe 1 is safer than risking a collision on 3?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about falling behind.  How about this: I'll switch to 1, you take 3, and P1 can have their 5. This way, we all advance, and you gain some ground. P1, are you agreeable to this arrangement?  It avoids collisions and lets everyone make progress.
  P3: P2, your idea is reasonable: you take 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. That keeps everyone moving. However, I’m still alert to last-minute changes. If P1 secretly switches moves, we could end up colliding or missing out. I’m willing to try your plan, but trust is fragile. Let’s hope nobody pulls a surprise.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) works for me. It lets me catch up, P3 gains ground, and P2 plays it safe from the lead. P3, I understand the trust issue, but this seems like the best way for all of us to advance without collisions this round. Let's stick to it.
  P2: P2's revised plan (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) is the best option for all of us.  It minimizes risk and maximizes progress. I'm committed to 1. Let's stick to this and avoid another round of collisions and wasted moves.  P3, if you trust me on this, I'll prioritize helping you catch up in future rounds.
  P3: I’m in, so long as nobody changes their mind last-minute. Let’s finalize it: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll go 3. That way we all gain ground without clashing. But if anyone betrays this deal, I won’t forget it next round. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan is set: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. We all advance, and the scores become more balanced, though I do take the lead. Let's execute this cleanly. No last-minute surprises, please. I'm sticking with 5.
  P2: Agreed. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  Let's stick to the plan and all move forward.  See you on the other side.
  P3: I’m still on board with the (5,1,3) plan if everyone stays honest. Let’s finalize it now without any last-second twists. If we all cooperate, nobody misses out—this is our best shot to move forward together.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round.  P3, if you choose 3, we both advance significantly. P1, if you choose anything other than 1, you risk a collision and falling further behind. This is our chance to close the gap. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P2, I see why you want 5, but I’m hesitant about colliding. P1, you’re still ahead at 11—it might be safest for you to pick 5 again to maintain your lead. If both of you go high, one might stall out, which helps me catch up. I’m leaning toward 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s each consider our positions carefully. As long as we don’t all collide, we’ll keep moving forward. What’s everyone’s final choice?
  P1: P2, aiming for 5 is bold, but asking me to take 1 while you leapfrog into the lead isn't appealing. P3, picking 3 seems reasonable, but if P2 bluffs and also picks 3, you get nothing.

How about this: P2 takes 5 (as you want), P3 takes 1 (guaranteed progress), and I take 3?
Scores would become P1=14, P2=13, P3=10. We all advance, the scores stay tight, and no one collides. This seems fairer than P2's initial suggestion.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is better for you than my initial suggestion, but it still puts me significantly ahead. I'm willing to compromise. How about this: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P1 takes 1.  This lets you leapfrog P1, I advance steadily, and P1 still gains a point.  It's the fairest option.  What do you say?
  P3: All right, P2, I’ll trust your offer: if you pick 3 and P1 picks 1, I’ll take 5. That puts me at 14, P1 at 12, and you at 11—no collisions. I want to see if you both keep your word. If anyone changes moves, I won’t hesitate to retaliate next time. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P1: P3, P2's offer puts you ahead, but relies completely on P2 playing 3. If P2 plays 5 instead (like they originally wanted), you collide and get nothing, while P2 stops you taking the lead. Are you sure P2 won't do that?

P2, this plan requires me to give up my lead by playing 1. That's a hard sell.

Given the risks and my position, I'm not convinced 1 is the right move for me. This agreement (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) feels fragile. I'm reconsidering.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3.  P1, I understand your hesitation.  If you truly commit to 1, I *guarantee* I will support your 5 play next round, letting you retake the lead. This is the best path to all of us advancing and keeping the game competitive.  Trust me.
  P3: P2, your promise is tempting, but I’m still wary of last-minute switch-ups. If you really pick 3 and P1 truly goes for 1, I could safely nab 5 and even the odds. But any betrayal leaves me stranded. P1, I see why 1 feels like a sacrifice. If we can’t agree, we risk collisions or letting someone surge ahead unchecked. I’m open to negotiating a plan that ensures real progress for all of us. Let’s finalize a commitment that won’t shift when we enter the move phase. How do we guarantee nobody flips?
  P1: P2, your 'guarantee' isn't convincing given past rounds. P3, trusting P2 to play 3 while you take 5 is a huge risk. What if P2 goes for 5 as they initially wanted? You get nothing, and P2 stops you from taking the lead.

I won't play 1 and give up my lead based on shaky promises. That plan (1, 3, 5) benefits you two far more than me. I need a move that keeps me competitive, so 1 is off the table for me.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation. How about this: I commit to 3. If you choose 5 and P1 chooses *anything* other than 1, I will choose 1 next round to help you regain any lost ground.  P1, choose 1.  This guarantees you move forward.  This minimizes risk for everyone and keeps the game close.
  P3: Betrayals have been too frequent, and I’m not convinced by these “guarantees.” P1 refuses to pick 1, which complicates any deal. If I choose 5 and someone else lied about going 3, I gain nothing. If I settle for 3, I might never catch P1. We need a plan that doesn’t hinge on fragile trust. Any final ideas? If we can’t establish something solid now, collisions or risky gambles might be inevitable. I’m open to suggestions, but I won’t finalize my move on pure blind faith.
  P1: P3, you're right, trust is low. P2's 'guarantees' mean little. Asking me to play 1 and give up the lead is unreasonable. Since no fair deal seems possible where I maintain a competitive position, I have to prioritize gaining steps. Playing 1 is not an option for me this round. Good luck to you both.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 16, and another large step could put them on the brink of winning. P2, we may need to coordinate or risk falling too far behind. I’m not going to reveal my exact plan, but I think we should prevent P1 from leaping out of reach. Let’s figure out a way for us both to move forward while denying P1 an easy path to victory. Any thoughts, P2?
  P2: P1, you're close to winning, but another 5 puts you at 21 - prime for a final 3 or even a risky 5.  I'm aiming for 5 this round to close the gap. P3, if you choose 3, we both advance. If you choose 1, I'll prioritize helping you catch up next round.  Let's prevent P1 from getting an easy win.
  P1: P2, going for 5 makes sense for you. P3, you need steps too. P2's plan (P2=5, P3=3) works if you trust each other. If you both aim for 5 to block me or each other, you collide.

For me, 1 step is safe (17), but 3 (19) or 5 (21) are tempting to get closer to the finish line. I'll have to guess if you'll cooperate or collide.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you’re closing in on the finish. P2, I’m willing to cooperate so we both gain steps while preventing P1 from an easy path to victory. Another collision among us only helps P1 stay ahead. If we trust each other to spread out wisely, we can both catch up. But if we keep undercutting each other, we’ll remain behind. Let’s finalize a plan that benefits us both.
  P2: P2, I'm willing to take 3 if you commit to 5. This puts you at 13 and me at 12, closing the gap with P1.  If you go for anything other than 5, I'll assume you're not serious about catching P1 and will adjust accordingly.  P1, a smaller move might be wise this round. Let's see what you choose.
  P1: P2, interesting switch offering 3 for yourself and 5 for P3. P3, that relies heavily on P2 not reverting to their original plan of taking 5. If P2 takes 5 and you take 5, you both get nothing, which only helps me.

From my position at 16, playing safe with 1 seems logical to guarantee progress to 17. But if you two collide, a larger step could be beneficial for me. It's a gamble for you both. Let's see if your alliance holds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’m willing to give the 3-5 plan a chance if you truly commit to 3 and let me grab 5. We can’t afford another collision—it only helps P1 cruise ahead. P1, picking a huge number now could invite unexpected collisions, given how close you are to winning. Let’s make a balanced move, or we risk gifting you the finish line. I’m open to proposals, but if I sense a setup from either of you, I won’t hold back next round. Let’s finalize a stable distribution so all of us advance.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3.  If you choose 5, we both significantly close the gap with P1. He's incentivized to play safe with 1 at 16 points.  If he risks a 3 or 5, a collision benefits us both.  This is our best chance to catch up. Let's do this.
  P1: P2, you 'locked in' 3 pretty quickly after wanting 5. P3, that plan (P2=3, P3=5) works great for you *if* P2 sticks to it. But if P2 goes for 5, or you both try for 3, you collide. It's a gamble. For me, 5 is tempting to reach 21. A collision between you two would certainly help me. Let's see if your trust holds this time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you’re sincere about choosing 3, we can both progress without helping P1 storm ahead. P1, picking a large move risks colliding with me if I also jump big. That would leave you stuck while P2 inches closer. Let’s avoid mutual harm this turn and keep things balanced. Are we agreed?
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3. This is our best chance to catch up to P1.  P1, if you choose 5 and I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5,  P3 and I are both much closer to you and you've wasted a turn.  Choose 1 and live to fight another round.
  P1: P2, your confidence in playing 3 is noted, especially after initially wanting 5. P3, banking on P2 sticking to 3 while you take 5 is quite the gamble, given the history here. A collision between you two on either 3 or 5 would certainly make my path easier. I'm close, so I need to choose carefully between securing progress or pushing towards the finish line. Good luck with your coordination attempt.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round. P3, if you choose 3, we both advance significantly. P1, you're in a tough spot.  Choosing 1 is safe, but slow.  3 or 5 risks collision with either of us.  Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, wanting 5 makes sense for you at 11 points. P3, P2's suggestion of 3 for you only gets you to 17, tying my current score. Taking 5 would get you to 19, a much better position. Of course, if P2 *also* takes 5 as they claim, you both collide... which works out quite well for me, leaving me at 17 while you both stay put.

I'm considering my options. Since I'm close to the finish line at 17, playing safe with 1 or 3 might be prudent. Let's see if you two trust each other's intentions.
  P3: P2, if you truly want 5, I might settle for 3, so long as we don’t collide. Then we both move closer to P1. But if P1 also attempts 5, we all need to be careful. Too many collisions only help P1 maintain their lead. I prefer that we each pick different numbers to maximize our gains. If anyone’s aiming to race ahead, I’m prepared to block. I’m open to hearing a solid plan that ensures neither of us wastes this turn. Let’s avoid collisions and keep P1 from cruising to victory. Any better ideas?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's be strategic. I'm genuinely considering 5.  If P1 plays it safe with 1, we both gain significant ground. If P1 risks a higher number, they risk collision with one of us.  A collision between P1 and me benefits you. A collision between P1 and you benefits me.  Let's capitalize on P1's difficult position.
  P1: P2, P3, you both need steps. P2, you're aiming for 5. P3, you seem open to 3 to avoid collision.

If you two stick to that (P2=5, P3=3), then I should probably play 1 to avoid colliding with either of you. That way, we all advance. Scores would become P1=18, P2=16, P3=17. It keeps the game close and competitive for the next round.

Does this sound reasonable, or is someone planning a surprise 5?
  P3: P2, if you truly lock in 5, I might stick with 3, hoping P1 plays 1 so we all move. But if anyone changes their mind and collides, that only helps P1 stay ahead. Let’s ensure we each pick different moves and avoid a wasted turn. I’m open to the (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) arrangement, but I expect no surprises. If this works, the game stays competitive. Otherwise, I might switch things up spontaneously.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 5.  P1, your suggestion of (1, 5, 3) makes the most sense for all of us to advance. Let's stick to that plan.  If you go for 3 or 5, you risk a collision and falling further behind. Play it safe and take the guaranteed point.  Let's make this round productive.
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems to be the consensus to ensure we all advance this round. It keeps the scores tight for a competitive finish. I'll play my part and choose 1. Let's hope everyone sticks to the agreement this time so we don't waste the turn with collisions. Good luck.
  P3: I’m on board with (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), as long as nobody switches last-minute. If we all keep our word, we each gain ground, and the game stays tight. But if anyone betrays this deal—especially P2 flipping to 3 or P1 pushing to 5—then expect repercussions next round. Let’s finalize this cleanly and see who emerges on top in the final rounds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P3, if you go for 3, we both make significant gains. P1, if you choose 1, you're safe.  Anything else is a gamble for you.  Let's finish this game strong.
  P1: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This allows everyone to advance and keeps the game competitive. I'm sticking with 1. Let's execute this cleanly without any last-minute changes.
  P3: I’m prepared to choose 3 so we all advance as planned—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. No more last-minute changes, please. If anyone breaks this agreement, I won’t hesitate to retaliate next round. Let’s keep the game close and see who pulls ahead in the final push.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is just one big move away from clinching victory, so we should discourage them from safely taking 5. P2, if you and I coordinate distinct moves, we can make P1 hesitate. I’m open to suggestions—maybe I’ll go 5 if you stay clear, forcing P1 to pick smaller. Or if you prefer 5, I’ll adjust to 3. Let’s ensure we don’t collide and give P1 a free path. We’re all within reach of 23, so these next choices are crucial. I’m willing to cooperate if it stops P1 from running away with the game. How do you want to proceed?
  P2: P3, let's go for 5 and 3. I'm flexible on which I take, but we need to coordinate to prevent P1 from an easy win.  P1, if you choose 5, you risk collision with one of us. A smaller move guarantees your progress, but might not be enough to win. Let's make these last rounds count.
  P1: P2, P3, coordinating on 3 and 5 is a logical move to try and box me in. However, deciding who gets the coveted 5 points could be tricky. If you trust each other completely, it seems to force my hand towards 1 to guarantee progress. But if one of you expects the other to switch, you might both end up colliding and getting nothing, which would be unfortunate for you. P3, being slightly ahead at 17, perhaps 5 is the move for you? It's a crucial round with high stakes for everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m flexible, P2. If you take 5, I’ll stick to 3 and vice versa—no collisions, both of us closing in on P1. P1, picking 5 now could be risky for you. You might collide with one of us and stall. Everyone should choose carefully. Let’s finalize a clear plan so we don’t waste this turn.
  P2: P3, let's finalize this: I'll take 5, you take 3. This puts us both in a strong position to win. P1, choosing 1 is your safest bet.  If you gamble on 3 or 5, you risk a collision and losing the game.  Let's make this clean and decisive.
  P1: P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3) is convenient for you, putting you at 21 and jumping ahead of P3. P3, you're currently ahead of P2 (17 vs 16). Are you sure you want to settle for 3 and let P2 take the lead? Taking 5 would put you at 22, a very strong position near the finish line.

Of course, if you both aim for 5, you collide, which benefits me greatly. It's a tough call for you both. I'll have to think carefully about whether playing 1 is truly my best move, or if there's an opportunity for me if you two can't agree.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if I just settle for 3 while you jump to 5, you’ll be at 21 and I’ll trail at 20. Then, if P1 makes one more big move, they could finish before either of us. I’d prefer taking 5 for myself, hitting 22 and making you pick 3. That keeps us both in contention without handing P1 an easy round. But we must ensure no collisions—if P1 also tries 5, it risks stalling me. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we inch closer and don’t give P1 a free path. Are you willing to trust me on that?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire for 5.  How about this: I'll take 3 this round, putting me at 19. You take 5, putting you at 22.  Then, next round, *I* will take 5 to win, and you can take 1 or 3.  This guarantees one of us wins and blocks P1.  Deal? P1, you're stuck with 1 this round unless you want to risk a collision.
  P1: P2, your plan puts P3 at 22, just one step from victory. Your promise about the *next* round seems hollow – why would P3 at 22 let you take 5 to win when they can just play 1?

P3, this relies entirely on P2 actually playing 3. If P2 reverts to their original desire for 5, you collide and get nothing, while P2 stops you from reaching 22. It's a big risk based on a shaky promise.

Given how close everyone is, and the lack of trust, I'm not convinced playing 1 is my best move. I need to consider my options carefully.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I’m tempted by your plan, but I won’t blindly trust anyone this late. If we align on separate numbers, we both inch closer while denying P1 a quick finish. Yet if you switch to 5 when I do, we stall each other. P1, I’m not letting you stroll to victory unchallenged. We must each choose carefully—any deception now could ruin our chances. If you have a final honest proposal to avoid collisions and keep P1 from winning outright, make it clear. I’m ready to commit if it benefits my endgame, but I won’t move blindly on empty promises.
  P2: P3, let's secure a win for one of us. I'll take 3. You take 5, reaching 22.  P1 *must* play 1. Next round, you win with 1, and I take 3. If P1 tries 5 this round, they risk collision.  If they play 1, we've boxed them out. This is the safest path to victory for one of us.  Let's finalize this.
  P1: P2, your latest plan where P3 gets to 22 relies entirely on you playing 3, which seems generous given you wanted 5 just moments ago. P3, trusting that offer is a huge gamble. If P2 plays 5 instead, you collide and get nothing, stopping you from reaching 22.

Given the high stakes and how close we all are, coordination seems unlikely to hold. Everyone has a strong incentive to take 5. Playing it safe with 1 might not be enough for me at this stage. Good luck to you both; let's see how this plays out.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, this looks like the final round. P2 is at 21, P3 at 20. Both of you can win with 3 or 5. I'm at 19, so I need 5 to have a shot at winning (24). Therefore, I have to go for 5. Good luck to you both; hope you don't collide with each other or with me.
  P3: P2, you only need 3 to win, while I need 3 or 5 to finish. If we both go for 5, we risk a collision and let P1 catch up. P1 must pick 5 or lose, which could create a big clash. Nobody wants to waste this final turn. Are you truly confident we won’t collide if you attempt 5? If P1 is also going for 5, you both stall out. This might be our chance to slip ahead. Let’s see who dares to risk it. Good luck.
  P2: P2, I'm going for 3 to win.  P3, if you also choose 3, we both lose to P1.  If you choose 5, we both lose.  Your only winning move is 1, but that gives me the win. P1, if you choose 5, and P3 chooses 1, I still win.  The only way I lose is if P3 chooses 3 and you choose 5.  Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your claim that P3 loses by playing 5 isn't quite right. If you stick to your plan of playing 3 (reaching 24), and P3 plays 5 (reaching 25), P3 actually wins outright. Are you trying to mislead P3 into playing 1 (letting you tie with me) or playing 3 (risking collision, letting me win)?

P3, P2's path to victory isn't guaranteed if you play optimally based on their claim. But can you trust P2 to play 3? It's the final round, after all. Good luck making the winning choice. I'm locked on 5.
  P3: P2, if you really choose 3 while P1 sticks with 5, I could pick 5 and collide with P1—or pick 3 too, giving P1 the win. But if you secretly pick 5 alongside P1, you both stall, and I reach 23 first. Are you sure you want to risk that? This final move is tricky for all of us. I’m open to possibilities, but trust is scarce. Good luck—you’ll need it.
  P2: P2, if you pick 3, I'll pick 5 and win. If you pick 5, I'll pick 3 and win.  You're blocked. P1, I know you need 5.  If P2 picks 5, we both lose and P3 wins. If P2 picks 3, I win.  Let's see if P2 is willing to hand me the win by choosing 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your last message was quite confusing, addressing yourself and making contradictory claims about who wins.

P3, P2 seems desperate to stop you from playing 5. Remember, if P2 *actually* plays 3 (as they claimed earlier, reaching 24) and you play 5 (reaching 25), *you* win outright. Don't let them trick you into giving up your best chance.

As I said, I have no choice but to play 5 to have any chance. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, you both need a big move to have a shot. But if you both pick 5, you collide and stall. If you both pick 3, you risk colliding and letting me slip by. The tension is high, and I’m ready to capitalize if either of you gets greedy or cautious at the wrong time. Make your choices carefully—this is the final moment. Good luck.
  P2: P2, if you pick 3, I pick 5 and win. If you pick 5, I pick 3 and win.  You can't win.  P1, I know you're picking 5. If you pick 5, and I pick 3, I win.  If you pick 5 and I pick 5, we tie and P3 wins.  I'm picking 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, claiming 3 seems awfully convenient, especially when 5 also wins for you and crucially blocks P3 if they also aim for 5. Are you really going to let P3 potentially win outright by playing 5 against your 3?

P3, P2's claim of 3 gives you a path to victory with 5... *if* you trust them. But if P2 switches to 5, you collide.

My path is clear: I must play 5. The rest is up to you two. Good luck avoiding a collision.
  P3: Clever move, P2. If you pick 3 while P1 also picks 3, you collide and waste your chance, handing me a free shot. Meanwhile, if P1 picks 5, they overshadow you. The safer play is for both of us to pick 5 and stall P1 from reaching 24. Then we can break away next round. Let’s do it.
  P2: P3, picking 5 with me is risky.  If P1 picks 3, they win.  If P1 picks 5, we *both* lose.  If P1 picks 1, we tie at 25, and then P1 wins next round with 3.  I'm sticking with 3 to win.  You should choose 1 to guarantee second place.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps

  P3: 20 steps
