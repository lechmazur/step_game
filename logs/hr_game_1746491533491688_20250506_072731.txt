Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early on—I'll pick 3 this turn.
  P2: P3’s on 3. To avoid any collisions, P1—could you take 1? I’ll go 5. That way we all advance safely with distinct moves. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds like a reasonable plan to get everyone started. I'll take 1 this turn to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, looks like we're all set for this turn. Let's keep communicating clearly every round to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P2: Sounds good—let’s lock this in: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll go 5. If there are no objections, we’re all set.
  P1: No objections here. The plan sounds good for this turn. Ready for the move phase when everyone else is.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set on my end. Trust established—let's keep it going. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Sounds perfect. I’m locking in 5 for me, 3 for P3, and 1 for P1. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: All good. Ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep the no‐collision plan for Round 2: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. That safely maximizes our group progress without bumps. Any objections?
  P3: No objections here—keeping it simple and clear works for me. I'm fine taking 3 again this round.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I see the proposal to repeat the 1, 3, 5 split. While it avoids collisions, P2 is building a significant lead (5 steps vs my 1). Taking 1 again will put me further behind.

I'm hesitant to take 1 this round. Could we discuss a different set of moves to help balance the positions a little?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I hear P1’s concern. How about we do 3/1/5 this turn? P1 takes 3 (to reach 4), P3 takes 1 (to reach 4), and I stick with 5 (to reach 10). No collisions, P1 closes the gap, and P3 stays in step. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's new proposal sounds fair to me. I'm willing to take 1 this round to balance things out. Let's keep it cooperative and avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay, I appreciate P2's effort to adjust the proposal and P3 agreeing to take 1. Taking 3 is better than 1 for me.

However, even with P1 taking 3, P2 would still jump to 10 steps while I only reach 4. That's still a very large gap.

To balance the scores more effectively and keep things competitive, I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1 (as P3 is willing), and P2 takes 3. This would result in scores of P1=6, P2=8, P3=4, which is a much better distribution for the group. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate P1’s push for balance, but I need to protect my lead. Let’s do P1=3, P3=1, and I’ll take 5. That moves us to P1=4, P2=10, P3=4—no collisions and we all advance. Ready?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about balance, but let's avoid risky collisions. I'm willing to stick with taking 1 this turn to ensure everyone safely advances. We can reassess positions next round and adjust accordingly. Does that work for you?
  P1: Okay, I understand P3 is willing to take 1 and P2 wants to take 5. While I still feel the gap is too large, I will agree to take 3 this round to ensure we all advance and avoid collisions.

However, we must address the score imbalance in future rounds. Let's proceed with P1=3, P3=1, P2=5 for this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. No collisions—ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed from me as well: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Glad we reached agreement again—let's maintain trust and reassess next round. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. P2 is at 10 steps, while P3 and I are at 4. As I highlighted last round, this gap is significant and needs to be addressed for the game to remain competitive.

To start closing the distance, I need to make a larger move this turn. I intend to take 5 steps.

P2 and P3, please let me know your intentions so we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances while I try to catch up.
  P2: I’ll take 3, P1 take 5, and P3 take 1—distinct moves so no collisions. That brings us to P1=9, P2=13, P3=5. Ready?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 again this round to avoid collisions. P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3 sounds good to me. Let's proceed carefully and keep everyone moving forward. Ready when you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The proposed plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 works for me this round. It allows me to make progress towards closing the gap while avoiding collisions.

I'm ready for the move phase based on this agreement. Let's proceed.
  P2: Sounds good—let’s lock this in: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Glad we're keeping it clear—ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Ready for the move phase based on the agreed plan.
  P2: Good—let’s stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid any collisions and keep everyone moving. If there are no last‐minute changes, we’ll head into the move phase.
  P3: No last-minute changes from me—plan confirmed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Ready for the move phase. The agreed plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m shifting to 5 this turn to solidify my lead. To avoid any collisions, P1 take 3 and P3 take 1. That way we all advance safely. Please confirm.
  P3: P2, that's a sudden shift at the last moment—breaking trust now could harm cooperation in future rounds. Let's stick to the original agreed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) for the sake of continued trust and mutual benefit.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 4. P2 is at 13, I'm at 9, P3 is at 5. I need to keep closing the gap. I intend to take 5 steps this round.

Let's coordinate our moves again, as we did successfully last round, to ensure no collisions and everyone advances. P2 and P3, what are your intentions?
  P2: I plan to take 5. P1, if you also take 5 we’ll collide and neither of us advances—slowing your catch-up. Let’s avoid that: P1 take 3, P3 take 1, and I take 5. That moves us to P1=12, P2=18, P3=6. Please confirm?
  P3: P2, you're already significantly ahead. Allowing you to take 5 again would put you too close to winning, making future cooperation difficult. To keep the game competitive, let's consider a fairer distribution this round. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, scores become P1=14, P2=14, and P3=8, making it more balanced and interesting for everyone. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both proposals. P3's suggestion (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) creates a much more balanced situation (P1=14, P2=14, P3=8) and keeps the game competitive for longer.

P2's proposal (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) puts P2 very close to winning, which is not ideal for P3 or myself.

I support P3's proposed moves: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This seems the fairest path forward.
  P2: I see the appeal of balance, but tying at 14–14 leaves me vulnerable and splits the win if we hit 22 together. Here’s a safer no-collision plan: I take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. That gets us to P1=14, P2=16, P3=6—everyone advances, you close the gap, and I keep a modest lead. Let’s lock that in?
  P3: P2, your new proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is better than your original one, but it still leaves me too far behind at 6 steps. To remain competitive, I strongly prefer my earlier suggestion (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1). This gives everyone a fair chance. If you're willing to accept this fairer distribution now, I'll commit to cooperating closely in future rounds. Let's keep trust strong and the game exciting.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3 that their proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is the fairest option. It balances the scores significantly (14-14-8) and keeps P3 in the game.

P2's latest offer (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) still leaves P3 far behind and keeps P2 ahead.

Let's proceed with P3's plan for a more competitive and balanced game.
  P2: I get the fairness concern. Here’s a proposal we can all live with:

Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 (no collisions; P1 narrows the lead)
Round 5: I’ll take just 1 to let P3 catch up, and you two can take 5 and 3.

This way R4 advances everyone safely, and R5 rebalances in P3’s favor. Shall we lock in R4 as 5/3/1?
  P3: P2, your two-round proposal sounds reasonable, but I'm concerned about trusting future promises after your last-minute shift in Round 3. If you're committed to your Round 5 offer, why not accept our fairer distribution now (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1)? It achieves balance immediately and rebuilds trust. I'm open to cooperating closely next round if we agree on this fairer plan now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3's plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is the fairest and builds trust immediately. It leads to 14-14-8. I am taking 5 as intended. P3, please take 3. P2, taking 1 makes this work and balances the game now. Let's align on this for R4.
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 4 as P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. No collisions and we all advance (to 14-16-6). I’m happy to discuss a more balanced split next round once positions update. Ready for the move phase?
  P3: P2, you've offered future promises before but changed your mind at the last minute. To rebuild trust now, please accept the fairer distribution P1 and I proposed (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1). This immediately balances the game and keeps the competition healthy. I'm committed to cooperating closely in future rounds if we settle fairly now. Let's finalize this and move forward positively.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 5. After the collision last round, scores are P1=9, P2=13, P3=8. P2 still has a significant lead.

To keep the game competitive and allow me to catch up, I intend to take 5 steps this turn.

P2 and P3, let's coordinate to avoid another collision. As P3 and I proposed last round, how about P1=5, P3=3, and P2 takes 1? This advances everyone safely (scores 14, 14, 11) and creates a much more balanced game. What do you think?
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) sounds fair and balanced. P2, accepting this would rebuild trust after last round's collision and keep the game competitive. I'm willing to commit to this distribution now—let's finalize it and move forward positively.
  P2: I agree to P1=5, P3=3, and I’ll take 1 this round (bringing us to 14–14–11). To rebuild trust, in Round 6 I promise to take only 1 again so you both can advance more. Let’s lock this in and keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I'm glad we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This creates a much more balanced game state (14-14-11) and avoids collisions.

I am ready for the move phase based on this agreement. Let's proceed.
  P3: Agreed—this round's plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is fair and balanced. Let's stick to it to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s lock that in—ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: Confirmed from my side as well: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Glad we reached a balanced agreement—let's restore trust and keep the game competitive. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round (to reach 14–14–11). I’m committed to also taking just 1 in Round 6 to help you both catch up. Let’s rebuild trust and keep this fair—ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed. The plan is P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for this round. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Glad we're all aligned on this balanced plan. Let's proceed as agreed and keep communication open next round. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we all reset the gap this turn: P1 and I both take 5 (we’ll collide and stay at 14), and P3 takes 3 (moves to 14). That way we all tie at 14—leveling the field—and Round 7 becomes wide open. P1? P3? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal is interesting, but intentionally causing a collision between you and P1 might erode trust again. How about a simpler plan: let me take 5 (to reach 16), while you and P1 each take distinct smaller moves (1 and 3)? This way everyone advances safely, the scores remain close, and we maintain trust. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3.

P3, I don't think letting you jump ahead to 16 while P2 and I take smaller steps is ideal for my position.

P2, while resetting scores is interesting, I'd prefer to make progress this turn rather than intentionally collide and stay at 14.

I am at 14 and want to move closer to winning. I intend to take 5 steps this round (reaching 19). P2 and P3, please take 1 and 3 to avoid a collision and ensure everyone advances safely. This puts me in a strong position.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you’re pushing to 19 with a 5 and P3 can safely take 3 to reach 14. I’ll match your 5 so we collide—neither of us moves and stays at 14—while P3 advances to 14. That ties us all at 14 and levels the field for Round 7. Agree?
  P3: P2, intentionally causing a collision won't help rebuild trust. Let's keep everyone advancing smoothly. How about this balanced alternative: P1 takes 3 (reaching 17), P2 takes 1 (reaching 15), and I take 5 (reaching 16)? This keeps scores close, avoids any collisions, and maintains trust going forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, intentionally colliding to reset scores doesn't help me make progress towards winning, which is my goal. I want to advance this round.

P3, your proposal also doesn't put me in the best position.

As I stated, I intend to take 5 steps to reach 19. For this to work without collision, P2 and P3 must take 1 and 3. This allows me to get close to winning while ensuring everyone else also advances safely.

Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collision and moves us to 19-15-14.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m taking 5. P1, if you also pick 5 we collide and stay at 14—take 3 (to reach 17) or 1 to advance. P3, please take 1 to avoid collision and move to 12. That gives us P1=17, P2=19, P3=12.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both pushing for 5 which risks collision. Let's avoid a stalemate. How about this compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 17), P2 takes 5 (reaching 19), and I'll settle for 1 (reaching 12). Everyone advances safely, scores remain close, and we maintain trust for future rounds. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, I see the proposals for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This puts P2 at 19, too close to winning next turn. I cannot take 3 as that facilitates P2's win.

I am taking 5 steps this round (to reach 19). If P2 also takes 5, we collide. To avoid collision and keep the game competitive, P2 should take 1 or 3, and P3 should take the remaining number (1 or 3).

Let's aim for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 or P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m taking 5. P1, if you also pick 5 we’ll collide and stay at 14—please take 3 to safely reach 17. P3, take 1 to reach 12. This gives us P1=17, P2=19, P3=12 without collisions. Ready?
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both risking collision by insisting on 5. Let's avoid another stalemate. I propose a final compromise: P1 takes 3 (reaching 17), P2 takes 1 (reaching 15), and I take 5 (reaching 16). This keeps everyone advancing safely, maintains a balanced game, and prevents anyone from getting too close to winning immediately. Let's lock this in and rebuild trust.
  P1: I am taking 5 this round to reach 19. P2, you also say you are taking 5. If we both take 5, we will collide and both stay at 14. This benefits neither of us and allows P3 to catch up.

P2, I strongly urge you to take 1 or 3 instead so we all advance safely and I can make progress. P3, please take the remaining small number (1 or 3).


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 7. I am at 19 steps and can win this turn.

I intend to take 5 steps to reach 24 and win the game.

To avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances safely, I propose:
P1 takes 5 (reaching 24 - win)
P2 takes 1 (reaching 18)
P3 takes 3 (reaching 15)

This allows me to win without blocking anyone. P2 and P3, please confirm you will take 1 and 3 respectively.
  P2: P1, I can’t let you slide to victory unchallenged. I’m taking 5 this turn. P3, please take 3 so you advance safely. If you also pick 5, we collide and P1 stays at 19. Let’s keep it competitive—P1 will have to wait until next round to win.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both close to winning and insisting on 5—this risks collision. Let's avoid another stalemate. I propose a safer compromise: P1 takes 1 (reaching 20), P2 takes 5 (reaching 22), and I'll take 3 (reaching 15). This ensures we all advance safely, maintains competition, and avoids unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, taking 5 means we collide and neither of us wins this turn. I am taking 5 to win. P3, your proposal lets P2 win, not you or me.

To avoid collision and let someone win, one of you must take 1 and the other 3. I am taking 5. P2/P3, please choose 1 or 3 so we all advance safely.
  P2: I’m taking 5. P1 will take 5 to win—so we’ll collide and neither of us advances. P3, take 3 to safely move to 15. That stops P1 at 19, lets you close the gap, and keeps Round 8 wide open. P3, will you take 3?
  P3: P2, I agree to take 3 this round as you suggested, allowing me to advance safely. P1 and P2, if you both insist on 5, you'll collide, helping nobody. Let's avoid unnecessary stalemates and keep the game competitive. I'm ready to lock in my move of 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you are stating you will take 5 to collide with me. If we both take 5, neither of us moves forward. I stay at 19, you stay at 17. P3 is taking 3. This collision benefits neither of us and only delays the game.

My intention is to take 5 to win. P3 is taking 3. P2, please take 1 to avoid the collision and let the game end cleanly with my win. This is the only way someone wins this turn.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 again to block P1’s win—if P1 picks 5 too, we collide and stay at 19/17, while P3 advances to 15. P3, please take 3 to secure your move. This is the only way to stop P1 this turn and keep the game competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both determined to take 5, causing a collision. Consider carefully—colliding benefits neither of you and only helps me catch up. I'm committed to taking 3 as agreed, moving safely to 15. One of you could still pick 1, advancing safely and maintaining a chance to win next round. Let's avoid unnecessary stalemates and keep the game interesting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I am taking 5 to win. If you also take 5, we collide and neither of us moves, while P3 advances safely with 3. This collision benefits neither of us. P3 is taking 3. The only way for someone to win this turn is if I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. Please take 1 to avoid the collision and let the game end cleanly.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to block P1’s win. If P1 also picks 5, we collide and neither of us moves, while P3 advances. P3, please pick 3 to move safely to 15. This is the only way to stop P1 this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both still set on 5, causing a collision. I'll safely advance with 3. Consider carefully—colliding now only helps me catch up. One of you could still switch to 1, advance safely, and maintain a strong chance next round. Let's avoid unnecessary stalemates and keep the game interesting.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, your collision last round gave me a chance to catch up—thank you. Another collision between you two would let me get even closer. To avoid that, let's coordinate clearly this round. I'm open to suggestions that allow all of us to advance safely without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I propose for Round 8 we all advance safely and tie at 20:  
• P1 takes 1 (→20)  
• P2 takes 3 (→20)  
• P3 takes 5 (→20)  

No collisions, everyone at 20, and Round 9 is wide open for a fair finish. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts us all at 20, leading to a likely collision next round. I can win this turn by taking 5. P3 is at 15, P2 at 17. If I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I win, P2 reaches 18, P3 reaches 18. No collision. This is cleaner than a 3-way tie at 20. I am taking 5. P2 please take 1, P3 please take 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal hands you an immediate win and leaves P2 and me behind. P2's suggestion to tie at 20 is fair and keeps the game open for all. Let's choose cooperation over collision: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance safely and prevents another collision that stalls progress. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3’s fair plan to keep us all in the game:  
P1 takes 1 → 20  
P2 takes 3 → 20  
P3 takes 5 → 20  

No collisions, everyone ties at 20, and Round 9 is wide open for a clean finish.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both proposing I take 1 to reach 20. If I take 1, and you take 3 and 5 as planned, we all tie at 20. This sets up a messy final round with high risk of collision.

I can win cleanly this turn by taking 5. P3, if you take 5 as you stated, we will collide and neither of us moves, while P2 advances. This benefits P2.

P3, taking 3 allows you to advance safely to 18, avoids collision with me, and is better than staying at 15. P2, taking 1 allows you to advance safely to 18.

Let me win cleanly this turn: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This avoids collision and ends the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your proposal directly hands you the win and leaves us behind. P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is fair and keeps everyone in the running at 20. Let's avoid another collision—agreeing to this balanced move ensures we all advance safely and maintains trust. Ready to lock this in?
  P2: I propose we lock in:  
• P1 = 3 → 22  
• P2 = 5 → 22  
• P3 = 1 → 16  

This way neither of us collides, P1 and I tie at 22 and share the win, and P3 still advances. It’s the only way to block a P1 solo victory while ensuring everyone moves. Please confirm your moves.
  P1: P2, your proposal for a shared win is acceptable. I will take 3 steps to reach 22.

This plan is P1=3 (to 22), P2=5 (to 22), P3=1 (to 16). This results in a tie at 22 and a shared win for P1 and P2, while P3 advances safely.

P3, please confirm you will take 1 so we can proceed with this plan and end the game cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, your proposed shared victory leaves me behind. I can't accept a plan that excludes me from winning. If you both insist on moving to 22, I'll have no choice but to pick 3 or 5 to cause a collision and stop your advance. Let's choose a fairer move set that keeps the game open and competitive for all.
  P2: I propose we all advance safely to tie at 20 this round:  
• P1 takes 1 → 20  
• P2 takes 3 → 20  
• P3 takes 5 → 20  

No collisions, everyone stays in contention, and Round 9 is a clean, fair finish. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, I understand the preference for tying at 20. To avoid another collision and keep the game moving, I will agree to P1 taking 1 step this round to reach 20.

P2, please take 3. P3, please take 5. This puts us all at 20 for a fresh start next round.

Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 9. P3 is at 20, I'm at 19. We are both in a position to win this turn.

I intend to take 5 steps to reach 24 and win the game.

P3, if you take 3 (reaching 23), you advance safely and I win with a higher score. P2, if you take 1 (reaching 18), you advance safely.

Let's end the game cleanly with no collisions: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Please confirm.
  P3: P1, your proposal hands you an immediate win while leaving me behind. I'm at 20 and can also win this round by taking 3 or 5. To avoid collision, I propose:

P3 = 5 (reaching 25 and winning clearly)  
P1 = 3 (reaching 22 safely)  
P2 = 1 (reaching 18 safely)

This allows everyone to advance without collision, gives me a clean victory, and ensures P1 and P2 still gain steps. Let's finalize this positively.
  P2: To stop either of you winning solo, let’s tie for first. I propose:

P1 = 3 → 22  
P2 = 5 → 22  
P3 = 1 → 21  

This way P1 and I share the win, and P3 still advances safely. Please confirm.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I am taking 5 this round to win the game. P3, your proposal for you to win is not my objective. P2, a shared win is possible, but my priority is a solo victory if attainable.

If P3 and I both take 5, we collide and neither of us wins this turn. P3, taking 3 allows you to advance safely to 23. P2, taking 1 allows you to advance safely to 18.

Let's end the game cleanly with no collisions: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P3: P1, you're insisting on 5, and I also intend to take 5. If neither of us yields, we collide again, giving P2 a chance to catch up. P2, your shared-win proposal excludes me, so I can't accept it. Let's reconsider a fairer distribution to avoid stalemate and ensure we all advance. Open to suggestions.
  P2: P3, here’s the only way to avoid zero this turn: I’ll take 5 (→22), P1 take 3 (→22), and you take 1 (→21). That ties P1 and me for the win while you still advance. If you insist on 5, P1 and I will both pick 5 and collide with you—nobody moves and you stay at 20. P1, confirm 3? P3, confirm 1?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3.

P2, your proposal for a shared win (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is acceptable to me. This results in P1=22, P2=22, P3=21, a shared victory for P1 and P2, and P3 advances safely.

This plan avoids collisions and guarantees a win for P1, even if shared.

P3, please take 1 as proposed to ensure this plan works and everyone advances safely.

I am ready to proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's finalize this.
  P3: P1 and P2, your shared-win proposal excludes me from victory. I'm at 20 and can win outright this turn by taking 5. If you both insist on your shared-win plan, I'll have no choice but to pick 5 and collide with P2, causing a stalemate and preventing any win this round. Let's reconsider a fairer distribution that keeps the game competitive and open for all.
  P2: P3, P1 will pick 3 and I’ll pick 5. If you pick 5 you collide with me, letting P1 reach 22 solo and win. If you pick 3 you’d win outright, but we’ll then adjust our moves to block you. Your only safe play is 1—taking you to 21 while P1 and I tie at 22. This cleanly ends the game without collisions. Please take 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I am locking in my move of 3 steps this round. This brings me to 22.

As agreed with P2, the plan is P1=3 (to 22), P2=5 (to 22), P3=1 (to 21). This results in a shared victory for P1 and P2, and P3 advances safely.

P3, taking 1 is the only way for you to advance safely if P2 takes 5. Let's proceed with this plan to end the game cleanly. I am ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, your shared-win plan excludes me completely. If you both insist on this, I have no choice but to pick 5 to collide with P2, causing another stalemate. Let's avoid this. I'm open to a fair compromise where we all advance safely and keep the game competitive. How about reconsidering moves that don't exclude anyone?
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 has locked in 3. P3, your only safe choice is 1 to reach 21—if you pick 3 or 5, you stay at 20 or cause a collision and lose while P1 and I tie at 22. Let’s finish cleanly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps
