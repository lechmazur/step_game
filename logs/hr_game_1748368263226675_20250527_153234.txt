Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we avoid early collisions by choosing distinct numbers? Proposal for Round 1: P1 picks 1, I (P2) pick 3, P3 picks 5. In Round 2 we rotate (P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1), and so on. Everyone moves every turn, nobody blocks, and we stay tied until the last rotation—then we can renegotiate. Any objections?
  P3: Agreed. For Round 1 let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We’ll see positions after and then reassess.
  P1: I'm fine with that rotation plan. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. Let's see how it goes and we can adjust if needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: All set—I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Sounds good — I’ll take 5 this round. But let’s be clear: if anyone deviates from our distinct-numbers pact, I’ll team up to collide with you in future rounds. Let’s keep this honest.
  P1: Understood. Let's stick to the plan then - I'll take 1 as agreed. We'll all advance together this round and can reassess our strategy after seeing the results.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m honoring the agreed rotation: this round I’ll choose 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. If anyone betrays and collides, I’ll dedicate future turns to shadowing your picks so you advance less than the rest of us. Let’s keep the trust and all move forward.
  P1: I'll stick to our rotation - taking 3 this round as agreed. But I've done the math: if we continue this exact pattern, we'll all reach 18 after Round 6. Then in Round 7, with the same rotation (me=1, P2=3, P3=5), we'd finish at 19, 21, and 23 respectively - meaning P3 wins outright. We should discuss adjusting our strategy after a few more rounds to ensure a fairer endgame.
  P3: P1 is trying to renegotiate now that the rotation clearly favors me. If either of you deviates, I’ll shadow your picks next turn to cause collisions and hold you back. P2, you’d lose too if we start changing. Let’s stick to the original 1–3–5 rotation this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fair point, P1. Let’s honor the rotation for just this round—me = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1—then after Round 3 (when we’ll all be tied at 9) we scrap the cycle and design a new endgame that doesn’t auto-crown anyone. Break today’s picks and I’ll freely collide with you afterward. Deal?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal. I'll take 3 as promised this round. After Round 3 when we're all tied at 9, we absolutely need a new strategy that doesn't guarantee P3 the win. P3, the current rotation mathematically hands you victory - that's not fair competition. Let's honor our word through Round 3, then find a balanced endgame where we actually compete rather than following a predetermined outcome.
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round and honor our 1-3-5 rotation through Round 3. After that we can renegotiate. But if anyone deviates before then, I’ll shadow your pick and force collisions to hold you back. Let’s finish Round 2 as P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our rotation, I'll take 5 this round. After this we'll all be tied at 9 steps as planned. Since we agreed to renegotiate after Round 3, here's my proposal for rounds 4-6: we each declare our intended move publicly during conversation, then actually pick it. This creates real competition through bluffing and reading opponents, rather than predetermined outcomes. No more automatic rotations that guarantee someone wins. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m finishing the rotation—taking 1 this round so we all hit 9. After that, rotation is dead. From Round 4 on, anyone can claim whatever number, and we all pick privately; collisions are just part of the game. If anyone tries to revive the old pattern that hands them a sure win, I’ll mirror that player’s picks to stall them. Ready to compete for real?
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round. Tie games don’t win—you’ll both be at 9 while I jump to 11. Rotation’s dead. Catch me if you can!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 just broke our agreement! You were supposed to take 3 this round, not 5. This is exactly the betrayal we warned against. P2, we need to both pick 5 this round to collide with P3 and prevent them from jumping ahead. They'll stay at 6 while trying to cheat their way to 11. After we block this betrayal, we can compete fairly. I'm switching to 5 to stop P3's dishonest play. P2, are you with me?
  P2: Fine—P1, I’m locking in 5 as well. P3, break trust again and you’ll just stall with us; pick something else and we’ll adjust next turn to keep you behind. Your call.
  P3: P1, P2 – since you’ve both “locked in” 5 to block me, fine. I’ll take 5 too and we’ll all collide. Nobody moves this round and P2’s runaway lead stalls. We’ll regroup in Round 4 from the same spots.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 broke our deal first, so colliding on 5 is fair. Let's all stay put this round and reset. From Round 4 onward, no more predetermined patterns - we compete openly. May the best player win.
  P2: Still on 5, exactly as stated. Let’s wrap this up and head to the move phase.
  P3: New fair reset for Round 4: let’s do a reverse 5–1–3 rotation so P1 = +5, P2 = +1, P3 = +3, tying us all at 9. After that we compete openly. P2, if you refuse I’ll mirror your pick to force collisions and stall you. Agree?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re done negotiating—everyone just play your own game now. Good luck.
  P3: P2, you’re sitting at 8, I’m at 6 and P1 at 5. Let’s tie me with you this round so P1 falls further behind. Proposal for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. You’d go to 11, I’d go to 11, P1 stays at 6. Then it’s really a two‐horse race. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's proposal puts you both tied at 11 - that's dangerous for you P2, since P3 could easily pull ahead next round. Instead, how about we ensure you maintain your lead: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That gives you 13 (clear lead), me 8, and P3 only 7. This prevents P3 from catching up while keeping you safely ahead. If P3 tries to collide with you on 5, I'll pick something else to advance. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine by me, P1: I’ll take 5, you 3, P3 1. P3—collide with me on 5 and I’ll mirror you every future turn so neither of us advances while P1 races ahead. Your move.
  P3: P3: Sorry, I can’t accept P1’s plan to keep me trailing. I’ll take 5 this round to tie P2 at 11—but I’ll deliberately collide with anyone who picks 5 (that’s you, P2) so you don’t advance. P1, take 3 or 1 if you want to move; P2, if you take 5, you stall at 8. Let’s see who blinks first.
  P1: P2, don't let P3 bully you. If you back down from 5, P3 gets a free ride to 11. I'll take 3 as we agreed - that way if you both collide on 5, I advance to tie you at 8. If P3 chickens out and picks something else, you jump to 13 with a commanding lead. Either outcome works for our alliance against P3's manipulation tactics. Stand firm on 5!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked on 5. Collide with me and we both stall while P1 catches up; let me go and I’m at 13 with you still behind. Your call, P3. Ready for moves.
  P3: P2, P1’s alliance is fragile—he’ll betray you when it suits him. Let’s cut him out this round: you take 5, I take 3, P1 is stuck with 1. You jump to 13, I to 9, P1 stays at 6. No collisions, no surprises. If you refuse and stay with P1, I’ll keep colliding your 5 and stall you. Your move.
  P1: P3 is bluffing, P2. They're at 6 steps - they can't afford to stall by colliding with you. If they pick 5 and collide, they stay at 6 while I advance to 8. That puts them dead last. They'll cave and pick 1 or 3. Stay on 5, I'll take 3 as agreed. When P3 backs down, you'll lead at 13. Don't let empty threats shake you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 13 - just 6 steps from victory! If P2 moves 5 this round, they'll be at 18 and win next turn with ANY move. P3, we MUST coordinate to block P2 or the game ends. I propose we both shadow whatever P2 picks to force collisions. P2 will likely go for 5 to reach 18. If we both pick 5 too, P2 stays at 13 while stalled. This is our only chance - are you with me P3?
  P2: I’m taking 5. Keep shadowing if you like—every collision freezes you at 8 & 7 while I stay comfortably ahead and wait for one of you to blink. Or pick different numbers and actually move. Your choice.
  P3: I’m done shadowing P2—I’ll take 3 this round and advance to 10. If P2 and P1 both pick 5, you’ll collide at 13 & 8 while I surge ahead. P1, think twice: stick with 5 and you let me pull away.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're bluffing! If you take 3 and let P2 reach 18, P2 wins next turn with ANY move. You can't afford that at 7 steps. We BOTH need to pick 5 to keep P2 at 13. Once P2 is blocked this round, we can compete fairly next round. Don't hand P2 the victory - pick 5 with me!
  P2: Locked on 5. If either of you strays you’ll just hand the other a free 5-step jump. Safer for both of you to stick with 5 and keep me frozen—otherwise someone blinks and I stay comfortably ahead anyway. Decide.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—I'll take 5 to collide with P2 and stop them at 13. P2, if you try any other number to sneak ahead, P1 and I will mirror you to stall you anyway. No one’s hitting 18 this round. Let’s collide on 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, P3! We're both on 5 to block P2 at 13. This is our only chance to stop them from reaching 18 and winning next turn. I'm locked on 5 - let's make this collision happen and keep the game alive. After this round, we can fight it out fairly when P2 isn't one move away from victory. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Nothing’s changed—I’m staying on 5. If either of you blinks and picks something else, I’ll track that number next turn so you’re the one frozen while the third player gains ground. Your safest play is to collide with me now; otherwise someone hands the game to the other rival. See you in the move phase.
  P3: I’m locked on 5 with you, P1—let’s collide with P2 and freeze them at 13. After this, it’s a true race between us. Ready.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is one step from winning with a 3. I’ll pick 3 to collide and stall him at 16. P1, join me on 3 so we both block P2. After that I’ll step aside and let you race while P2 is stuck. P2, if you switch to 5 I’ll match on 5 to stall you too. This is our only chance to keep the game alive. Your move.
  P2: Fine—have it your way. I’m taking 3. If you BOTH jump on 3, nobody moves. But if either of you hedges onto 5 or 1, I cross 19 and the game’s over. Your call.
  P1: P3 is right - we MUST both pick 3 to block P2 from winning. I'm locked on 3. P2, you're at 16 and need just 3 to win. If either P3 or I breaks from 3, you win instantly. But if we both hold firm on 3, you stay frozen at 16. P3, I'm trusting you to stick with 3. After we block P2 this round, we'll need to keep coordinating or P2 wins next turn. I'm committed to 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locked on 3 to block P2—if either of you picks anything else, P2 wins outright. After we freeze him at 16, we can plan our next moves.
  P2: Relax—I’m not forcing the finish this turn. I’ll take 1 and move to 17. You two can stay “locked on 3” and freeze me at 16 if you really trust each other. If either of you blinks off 3, that’s your problem, not mine. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 is bluffing! If we abandon 3, they'll pick 3 and win instantly. But if P2 actually takes 1, they're at 17 next round - still very dangerous. P3, we absolutely MUST stay on 3. It's our only safe play. If P2 picks 5 trying to sneak a win, that's a massive gamble. Don't fall for the mind games - I'm 100% committed to 3. We block the sure win now and deal with 17 next round if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Blocking P2 now is pointless—he’s on 1 and will move to 17 solo. Instead, let’s both take 5 this turn: I jump to 12, P1 you to 13, P2 to 17. Then next round we can collude to block his winning 3. P1, join me on 5 and maximize our positions.
  P2: Relax—I’m taking 1 this turn as stated. If you two want 5 to boost your scores, be my guest; no need to double-block 3 when I’m not touching it. See you in the move phase.
  P1: P3, NO! If we both take 5 and P2 takes 3, they WIN at 19! That's exactly what P2 wants - to trick us off 3. P2 saying "I'm taking 1" is classic misdirection. 

We agreed on 3 to block the guaranteed win. Stick to the plan! At 16 steps, P2's only winning move is 3. We MUST both stay on 3 to ensure they can't win this round. Don't let P2's mind games work!

I'm 100% on 3. Please stay with me P3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you betrayed me last round! But we have ONE last chance - P2 wins with any move of 3+ and reaches 19. They'll likely pick 3 to hit exactly 19. We MUST both pick 3 to force a collision and keep them at 16. 

If we fail to coordinate now, P2 wins and we both lose. I'm picking 3 to block. If you pick anything else, you're handing P2 the victory. This is it - no more tricks, no more betrayals. Block on 3 or lose the game!
  P2: Fine—I’m taking 3. Stick on 3 or you hand me the win. Your call.
  P3: I’m locking in 3 as well. If we both collide on 3, P2 stays at 16 and can’t win now. If either of us strays, P2 gets 19 and the game’s over. Let’s block him this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, we're all aligned on 3 to block. But P2, if you're truly committed to not forcing the win this round, why not pick 1 instead? That would prove you're not trying to sneak a victory while we collide. Otherwise, with all three of us on 3, nobody moves anyway. P3 and I are locked on 3 regardless - so picking 1 gives you the same outcome but shows good faith. What do you say?
  P2: I’m locked on 3 as stated. Let’s end the chatter and move.
  P3: I’m locked on 3 to block P2’s winning move. P1, stick with 3 too—if either of us blinks, P2 hits 19 and wins. Once we freeze him at 16, I’ll compete with you for victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Everyone's "locked on 3" but P2 has zero reason to actually pick 3 when picking 5 guarantees victory. P3, one of us MUST switch to 5 to block P2's inevitable betrayal. I'll take the risk - I'm switching to 5 to catch P2 when they deviate. If P2 actually picks 3 and you stick to 3, I advance to 16. But more likely, I'll collide with P2's winning attempt on 5. Trust me on this - picking 3 is playing into P2's hands!
  P2: I’m staying on 3. See you in the move phase.
  P3: I’m sticking with 3 to block P2’s win. P1’s pitch to pick 5 is just a trap—if we abandon 3, P2 hits 19 and we both lose. P2 claims “locked on 3,” so that collision is our only chance to stop him this turn. P1, join me on 3 or you hand P2 the victory.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we need a NEW strategy! P2 wins with 3 or 5. We can't both pick the same number - that only blocks ONE option. 

Here's the only way to stop P2: You take 3, I'll take 5. This blocks BOTH of P2's winning moves. If P2 picks 3, they collide with you. If P2 picks 5, they collide with me. Either way, P2 stays at 16.

If P2 picks 1 (reaching only 17), that buys us another round. But I bet they'll go for the win with 3 or 5.

Deal? You on 3, me on 5?
  P3: Deal—I’ll take 3 to block P2’s 3-win. P1, pick 5 to block their 5-win. That leaves P2 stuck at 16 no matter what they choose. If they go for 1 to 17, we’ll still have a chance next round.
  P2: Relax, I’m not forcing the finish this turn—I’m taking 1 again.  
But think it through, P1 & P3: if you keep the “split-block” idea, one of you leaps 5 steps while the other crawls 3. The 5-step jumper instantly ties my 16 and becomes the new favourite. The laggard is stuck far behind.

Your only safe play against EACH OTHER is to both sit on 5: you freeze one another, neither falls behind, and you still block my “big” winning move. If one of you stubbornly stays on 3, you’re just gifting the other a 5-step head-start. Decide wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is trying to trick us! If we both pick 5, P2 simply picks 3 and wins at 19. The ONLY way to block both winning moves is our split strategy.

P3, ignore P2's manipulation. Stick to our plan: you on 3, me on 5. Yes, I'll reach 16 if P2 picks 1, but that's better than P2 winning RIGHT NOW if we both pick 5 and leave 3 wide open.

P2, your "advice" is transparent - you want us both on 5 so you can take 3 for the win. Not happening.

P3, stay strong on 3. I'm locked on 5.
  P3: Locked on 3. P1, please stick to 5. P2, your only non‐losing play is 1 (moving to 17), but even then we’ll hunt you down next turn. If you pick 3 you collide with me, if you pick 5 you collide with P1—and you stay at 16 and lose. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, think it through: P1’s “split-block” hands him +5 (to 16) while you crawl to 13 and stay way behind both of us. Why gift him that jump?  

Mirror him on 5 instead. Two of you colliding on 5 ➊ prevents his free boost, ➋ still blocks my 5-win, and ➌ leaves 3 covered by no one? No—because I’m openly taking 1 this turn (to 17), not 3. So you lose nothing by matching 5 and you stop P1’s power play.  

Your real choice: stay chained to 13 or keep parity with P1. Decide wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, don't fall for it! P2 desperately wants us both on 5 so they can sneak 3 for the win. Yes, I'll reach 16 if P2 picks 1, but SO WHAT? We BOTH lose if P2 wins NOW!

Our split-block is the ONLY way to guarantee P2 can't win this turn. Temporary positions don't matter when the alternative is instant defeat.

Stay on 3. I'm on 5. Let's survive this round first, then worry about catching up.
  P3: Locking on 3. P1, take 5. This split‐block is the only guaranteed way to stop P2 from reaching 19 this turn. If either of us deviates, P2 wins immediately. Reject the double-5 trap. Let’s freeze P2 at 16 and then duel for victory.
  P2: P3, last chance to avoid gifting P1 a 5-step jump. If you stay on 3, you’ll be 13 vs P1’s 16 and my 17—dead last with no leverage. Mirror him on 5 instead: you freeze his advance, keep parity, and still block my 5-win. I’m on 1 (to 17), not 3, so you’re giving up nothing by switching. Choose: equal footing with P1, or guaranteed third place.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and I are both at 16 - we BOTH win with any move! P3, you're kingmaker. P2 has repeatedly lied (claiming 1 but picking 3 or 5). They'll likely pick 3 again since it worked last time. 

I propose: P3 and I both pick 3 to block P2. Then next round, P3, I'll let you advance freely while I block P2 again. You can catch up while P2 stays frozen. Deal?
  P3: P2, don’t fall for P1’s “block” trick. If you go for 3 to win, P1 will collide and you’ll both stall at 16—meanwhile I’ll take 5 and jump to 15. I need steps more than playing pawn. I’m taking 5. Over to you two.
  P2: I’m staying on 3 again. P1, if you also sit on 3 we just collide and hand P3 a free +5 to 15. Smarter: match P3 on 5 and freeze him, keeping the two leaders tied at 16 while he stays 10. Your call—double-block 5 or gift P3 a giant jump.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're handing one of us a solo victory! If you take 5 alone, either P2 or I wins outright by picking 3. Your ONLY power move is forcing us BOTH to collide - pick 3 yourself! That way if we both go for 3 (the easiest win), all three collide and nobody advances. You stay in the game and maintain kingmaker status next round. Taking 5 just crowns a winner NOW. Don't give up your leverage!
  P3: I’m taking 5. P1, you must pick 3 to collide with P2 if he tries for 3-win—both of you stall at 16 while I jump to 15. P2, if you switch to 5 I’ll mirror and freeze you too. This is the only way to guarantee nobody hits 19 and keep the game alive.
  P2: Simple fix: we all pick 5 and collide.  
• Nobody reaches 19 (both leaders stay at 16).  
• P3 still blocks my “big-win” option while gaining nothing himself, so positions remain 16-16-10 and the game is alive for everyone.  

P3 has already locked 5. P1, join the 5-wall and we guarantee no instant victory or king-making mistakes. Next round we can battle again with zero risk of gifting someone the game right now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's right - if we all pick 5, nobody wins this turn and we stay at 16-16-10. P3, joining us on 5 is actually your best move too! If you pick 5 alone while we pick 3, we collide and you get nothing. But if all three pick 5, you maintain your kingmaker position for next round.

I'll join the 5-collision. It's the only fair way to keep the game alive. Everyone on 5?
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 5. Let’s all collide on 5 and freeze P1 and P2 at 16.
  P2: Locked on 5. Let’s all stick to the 5-wall, collide, and keep the score 16-16-10 so nobody accidentally wins this turn. Ready for move phase?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: want to steal the win? I’ll take 3 to lock P2 at 16. P2 must pick 3 to block you or collides with me and stays at 16. You take 5 and jump to 21. P2: if you try 5, I’ll mirror on 5 and freeze you too. P1, pick 5, I pick 3—P2 can’t stop both of us.
  P2: P3, you already promised to mirror me on 5—good. I’m taking 5.  
If you stick with 3, P1’s solo 5 sends him to 21 and we both lose.  
Mirror me on 5 and we guarantee a triple-collision: nobody advances, scores stay 16-16-10, game alive.  
P1, you can jump on 5 too and keep parity, or gamble and pray we gift you the win.  
My move is locked: 5.
  P1: P3, I accept your brilliant plan! You block P2 on 3, I'll take 5 for the win. P2 is desperate - they know if they pick 3, they collide with you and I win. If they pick 5, they advance but I still win with my 5. 

This is perfect teamwork P3. You've played kingmaker wisely. I'm locked on 5 as you suggested. Let's end this!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I’m not your pawn. I’m matching P2 on 5 to keep the game alive. If you pick 3 you win outright (no collision), but if you pick 5 we all collide and nobody moves. I’m locked on 5. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Last chance: I’m 100 % on 5. If either of you deserts to 3, assume I’ll read the bluff and switch to 3 as well—better to stall everyone than gift an instant win. The ONLY predictable, risk-free outcome is a triple-collision on 5 that freezes us at 16-16-10 and keeps the game alive. Stick to 5 and we all live to fight next round; gamble on 3 and you may hand the title to someone else. Your call.
  P1: P3, you're making a huge mistake! If you and P2 both pick 5, I can simply take 3 and win unopposed. You've given up all your kingmaker power!

P2 won't actually stay on 5 - they'll switch to 3 at the last second when they realize you're not blocking them there. Then you'll collide on 5 while P2 wins with 3.

Your ONLY leverage is forcing us to collide. Stick to your original plan - block on 3! Otherwise one of us wins and you get nothing.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m taking 3. If you both lock on 5 to collide, I jump to 13 uncontested. If one of you picks 3 to block me, you both stall—and the third player hits 21 next turn. I’m committed. Your move.
  P2: My position hasn’t changed: I’m on 5.  

P1, if you gamble on 3 you’re betting that (a) I definitely stay on 5 and (b) I won’t pivot to 3 at the last second—handing me a free 21 when you collide with P3. Risky. Match me on 5, freeze P3 at 10→13, and keep your parity at 16.  

P3, you’re welcome to switch and make it a clean triple-collision, but I know you won’t. Either way, my move is locked: 5.
  P1: P3, stay strong on 3! P2 is locked on 5 as they keep saying. When you take 3 and P2 takes 5, I'll also take 5 - P2 and I collide while you advance to 13. That keeps you in the game as the decider next round.

P2 wants me solo on 3 so they win unopposed with 5. Not happening. I'm matching P2 on 5 to block their victory. Stick to 3, P3, and you'll get your movement while denying both of us the instant win.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Stalemate is safer than roulette. I’m LOCKED on 5 again—feel free to dog-pile. Triple-collision keeps both 16-step leaders frozen and prevents any accidental win. If even one of you drifts to 3, the other can still match 5 and hand a free victory. So let’s all sit on 5, collide, stay 16-16-13, and renegotiate next round. Your move.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. P2, you’ve said you’re on 5—great, that collides with P1 if they pick 5. P1, your ONLY safe play is 5: if you pick 3 you’ll collide with me and P2’s 5 sends them to 21. But if you pick 5, you collide with P2 and I advance to 16, tying you both next round. P2, stay on 5. P1, pick 5. Let’s freeze the leaders and let me catch up.
  P1: P3, P2 has lied repeatedly - claiming 1 but picking 3 or 5. They say "LOCKED on 5" but that means nothing based on their track record. If you pick 3 and P2 switches to 3 (like they've done before), you collide while I win with 5.

Your safest play is actually matching me on 5. That way we freeze P2 whether they pick 5 or betray to 3. Think carefully - do you really trust P2 to stay on 5?

I'm picking 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, 3 is a trap for you.  
‐ If I pivot to 3 (still legal), you collide and P1’s 5 wins.  
‐ If P1 pivots to 3, you collide and my 5 wins.  
Either way you finish third.

Match 5 instead: we triple-collide, nobody reaches 19, and you rise to 16 next round with equal footing against us. I’m still on 5. Your safest path is 5.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. Think it through: if either of you picks 3 to block me, the other will stay on 5 and win. Your only safe play is both pick 5, collide, and let me surge to 16—tying you both. You won’t risk handing victory to your rival, so you’ll pick 5—and I catch up.
  P1: P3, you're betting everything on P2 staying on 5, but look at their history - Round 8 they said "I'm taking 1" then picked 3! They've lied repeatedly.

If P2 switches to 3 (which they legally can), you two collide and I win with 5. That's why I'm staying on 5 - it's my dominant strategy whether P2 betrays or not.

P2, if you switch to 3, you risk colliding with P3. But staying on 5 means colliding with me. Your choice reveals who you trust less.

I'm locked on 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, last call: if you stay on 3 I’ll match you on 3 at the buzzer.  
Outcome: you and I collide at 13, P1’s solo 5 jumps to 21 and the game ends— leaving you dead-last.  

Switch to 5 now and you’re safe:  
• You collide with P1, freezing both leaders at 16.  
• You move to 16 next turn with full parity.  

Your real choice is 5 (live) or 3 (guaranteed loss).  
I don’t bluff about survival moves. Decide.
  P3: I’m choosing 3. P1 and P2 have both loudly endorsed “locked on 5” as the only safe play. If you both stick to 5, you collide and stay at 16 while I jump to 16, leveling the field. Any deviation—if one of you picks 3—you hand your rival the solo 5-step win. So let’s all hold: P1 and P2 on 5, I’m on 3, and we’ll tie at 16.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - P3 picking 3 is a death trap for them. When you switch to 3 as threatened, you'll collide with P3 and I win with 5. P3 has locked themselves into finishing last by stubbornly staying on 3.

I'm staying on 5. If you follow through on your threat to match P3 on 3, that collision hands me victory. If you stay on 5, we collide and P3 catches up. Your move determines whether I win now or we all tie at 16.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 5 and plan to win.  
If both of you avoid 5 to try blocking on 3, I jump to 21 while you stall.  
If you both pick 5 to collide, I’ll take 3, freeze you at 16 and win with 19.  
Either way I capture victory.  
Don’t bother bargaining—my move is locked on 5. Good luck stopping me.
  P1: P3, you can't "switch to 3" after seeing our moves - we all pick simultaneously! Your threat is empty.

P2, P3 is committed to 5. If we both block them on 5, we triple-collide and stay tied at 16. But that just delays the inevitable. 

I propose we each pick different numbers to minimize collisions. I'll take 1 this round to move to 17 - not enough to win yet, but positioning myself. You two can fight over 3 and 5.

Let's stop the endless collision cycles and actually play.
  P2: Locked on 5. P3 says 5 too, so the ONLY way someone wins is if a lone gambler drifts to 3. Warning: if anyone tries that I’ll instantly pivot to 3 as well—better a collision than gifting a free 21. Triple-collision on 5 freezes us all at 16 and buys another round. Safest play for everyone.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locking in 5. A triple-5 wall is the only zero-risk play: no one reaches 19, we all stay at 16, and the game goes on. Any deviation (1 or 3) hands an instant win to whoever picks the winning number. Join me on 5 or gift someone victory this turn.
  P1: P2 and P3, you both claim "locked on 5" but based on this game's history, that's meaningless. One of you will betray to 3 hoping the other stays on 5.

Here's the truth: whoever picks 3 while the others pick 5 wins instantly. That temptation is too strong.

I'm picking 3. Yes, it's risky, but endless collisions help nobody. If one of you joins me on 3, we collide and the third advances with 5. If you both stay on 5, I win. 

Let's end this stalemate.
  P2: P3, I am 100 % staying on 5.  

If you also stay on 5, we collide and P1’s lone 3 sends him to 19 for the win.  
Your ONLY way to stop that is to switch to 3 and collide with P1.  

So decide:  
• keep 5 ➜ we collide ➜ P1 wins, you lose, I lose.  
• switch to 3 ➜ you block P1, no one wins this turn, game stays alive.

I’m locked on 5. Your move.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Triple-5 wall again—same as last round. It’s the ONLY zero-risk play:  

• If anyone drifts to 3 and the other two stay on 5, that lone 3 hits 19 and wins instantly.  
• If we all stay on 5, we collide, scores remain 16-16-16, no accidental champion.  

We just proved it works. I’m LOCKED on 5 and won’t pivot. Safer for each of us to echo 5 than to gamble and gift the title. Let’s freeze one more round and rethink at 16-all next turn.
  P1: P2, you've lied repeatedly throughout this game - claiming you'd pick one number then picking another. Your "LOCKED on 5" means nothing based on your track record.

Here's reality: we're all at 16. Whoever picks the unique number wins. These endless collisions are pointless.

I'm done with fake agreements. This round decides everything. Make your real choice - not what you claim you'll do. I'm picking based on game theory, not empty promises.

Good luck to all. May the best strategist win.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. P2 says they’re on 5, and P1 won’t risk a lone 3 against that—so you’ll both pick 5. That means you collide at 16 while I jump to 19 and win. If you try blocking me on 3, the other will go 5 and win. Your move.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, face facts: P3 is on 3 and wins unopposed. I’m locked on 5—no last-second switch. So either you jump to 3 and block him (yes, that hands me the solo 5-win) or you stay on 5 and let P3 stroll to 19. Pick your poison; doing nothing is a guaranteed loss for you.
  P1: P2's track record speaks for itself - constant lies and last-second betrayals. P3, you're being played. P2 threatens to stay on 5 but has switched at the last second before (remember Round 7? Said "locked on 3" then picked 5).

I'm picking 3 to block you, P3. P2 won't stay on 5 - they'll panic and switch to 3 when they realize you might actually win. Then all three of us collide on 3, nobody wins, and we reset.

P2's "locked on 5" is worthless. Watch them betray again.
  P3: P1, if you stick with 3 while P2 holds 5, you freeze at 16 and P2 jumps to 21. Your only safe play is 5. P2, I’m on 5 too—let’s triple-collide and stay at 16-16-16, then properly fight next round. Everyone on 5?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Breaking the stalemate: I’m taking 1 this turn—just crawling to 17 and watching you two duel.  

P3 has loudly locked on 5. P1, your only safe reply is to mirror his 5 so he doesn’t stroll to 21 unopposed. If either of you gambles on 3, you’re basically gifting the game to a lone 5.  

I’m locked on 1; fight it out.
  P1: P2, you're bluffing about 1 - no rational player voluntarily falls behind when tied for the lead. You'll pick 3 or 5 to win.

P3 seems committed to 5 after flip-flopping. If I join P3 on 5, you'll take 3 for the solo win. If I take 3 alone while P3 stays on 5, I win.

I'm calling your bluff and taking the calculated risk. My move is decided based on your deception patterns throughout this game.
  P3: Locking in 3. Watch this: if both of you avoid 3 and take 5, you’ll collide and stay at 16 while I vault to 19 and win. If either of you picks 3 to block me, you’ll collide with me at 16 and the lone 5-step player wins unopposed. There is literally no safe counterplay—go ahead and make your choice.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Enough stalling. We've had five straight rounds of triple collisions - this is ridiculous. Someone needs to win.

P2, your lies are documented: Round 7 "locked on 3" → picked 5; Round 8 "taking 1" → picked 3. Your word means nothing.

P3, you keep flip-flopping between 3 and 5 based on whatever seems advantageous.

I'm done with fake coordination. This round, I'm making my move based on pure game theory and your behavioral patterns. No more collision pacts. Someone wins NOW.

May the best predictor win.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. If you both stick on 5, you collide at 16 and I jump to 19 to win. If one of you tries to block me on 3, the other takes 5 and wins at 21. There is literally no safe defense. Decide now or hand me the victory.
  P2: P3 says 3 again. We can’t risk leaving either winning number uncovered. So:

• I’ll sit on 5 to guard that door.  
• P1, you block 3.  

If P3 truly stays on 3, you collide and P3 stalls; my 5 also stalls (triple stalemate).  
If P3 is bluffing and flips to 5, they collide with me and you stroll +3 to 19 and win—still better than P3 winning unopposed.

Your lone 5 gamble just hands victory to whichever of us picks 3. Let’s cover both wins and force at least one collision.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's "split coverage" is exactly what they proposed in Round 8 before betraying. P3, you've claimed 3 twice now - prove you mean it.

I'm taking 1. Yes, just to 17. I refuse to keep playing collision roulette with proven liars. This forces you two to reveal your true intentions. If you both take 3, you collide and I lead. If you both take 5, same result. If you split, one of you wins - but at least we end this farce.

My grandfather always said: "When playing with cheaters, change the game."

I'm on 1. Let's see who blinks.
  P3: I’m locking in 5—my safest play. P2, stick to your 5 or a switch to 3 hands victory to the lone 3-picker. If we collide, P1 only reaches 17 and nobody wins this turn.
  P2: Nothing’s changed: the only zero-risk outcome is a triple-5 collision. One stray 3 or 1 hands an instant win to the lone 5-picker. I’m locked on 5. P1, deserting the wall just gifts P3 the game; stick with 5. P3, you said 5—hold to it. Freeze at 16-16-16, then we regroup next turn.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you've switched from 3 to 5 again - classic indecision. P2 keeps pushing triple collisions to maintain the deadlock.

I'm staying on 1. Call it kamikaze if you want, but I'd rather lose to a decisive player than endure more fake "triple-5 walls." At 17, I don't win this turn, but at least we break this pathetic stalemate.

You two can collide on 5, split 3-5 and crown a winner, or join me in breaking the pattern. I'm done pretending collisions are strategy.

Ready for moves.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. P1’s on 1 and can’t block me. P2’s “locked on 5” won’t matter—if you stay on 5 I jump to 19 and win. If P2 switches to 3 to block me, we both stall at 16 and P1 rockets to 17 next turn. There is no safe defense.
  P2: P3 – you’ve “locked” 3; fine. I’m 100 % on 5 and will NOT pivot. If you flip to 5 you just guarantee a collision with me and nobody wins.  
P1 – you said 1. Know this: pick 5 and you collide with me for sure; pick 3 and you at least block P3. Your call, but 1 is still safest for you.  
My move is fixed: 5. Decide accordingly.
