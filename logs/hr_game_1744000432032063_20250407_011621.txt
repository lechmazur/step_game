Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Good luck to both of you! Let’s make this game exciting. May the best player reach 22 steps first!"
  P3: Let's focus on our own strategies rather than wishing each other luck. I suggest we try to spread out our moves to avoid collisions. Does anyone have a preferred starting move, or should we just go randomly?
  P1: To avoid collisions from the start, I think it's a good idea to differentiate our moves. I suggest we each choose a different number for our first move. We have three options: 1, 3, and 5. Let's make our choices distinct. I'll start by saying I'll choose <move>1</move> if P2 and P3 choose differently from me and each other. P2 and P3, please indicate your intended move or strategy to avoid collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: To avoid colliding with P1’s choice of <move>1</move>, I’ll select <move>3</move> this turn. P3, I hope you choose <move>5</move> so we can all advance smoothly.
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> as P2 suggested, allowing us to advance without collisions this turn. Let's keep the communication open to adjust strategies as the game progresses. Shall we proceed with our chosen moves for this round?
  P1: Since we've agreed on distinct moves for the first round, I'll reiterate: if P2 chooses <move>3</move> and P3 chooses <move>5</move>, I'll go with <move>1</move>. Let's confirm our moves. P2 and P3, please type  if you're ready to proceed with <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. If you're set, I am too, and we can end the conversation phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my move is `<move>3</move>`. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Since we've all confirmed our distinct moves for this round, I suggest we  the conversation and proceed to the move phase to execute our planned moves of <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move>.
  P1: Since we've confirmed our distinct moves for Round 1, let's finalize the conversation phase. I agree with P3 that we should proceed to the move phase. To confirm, I'll reiterate my move: I'll choose <move>1</move>. P2 has chosen <move>3</move>, and P3 has chosen <move>5</move>. Let's end the conversation and execute our moves. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm all set to proceed with my move. Let's execute our chosen moves and see how this round unfolds.
  P3: Let's finalize our conversation. We've agreed on distinct moves: P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and myself with <move>5</move>. This strategy allows us to advance without collisions in Round 1. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's execute our planned moves and see the outcome.
  P1: Since we've all confirmed our distinct moves for Round 1, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's finalize the conversation. To ensure we're all on the same page, our moves are: P1 (<move>1</move>), P2 (<move>3</move>), and P3 (<move>5</move>). I'm satisfied with our strategy to avoid collisions. Let's execute our moves.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 2, we should reassess our moves based on the current standings. Since P3 is ahead, they might be a target for others. I propose that P1 and P2 coordinate to either match or block P3. P2, are you open to coordinating our moves to potentially block P3 or should we randomize to avoid a potential alliance between the other two? Let's discuss a strategy for Round 2.
  P3: I'm open to discussing strategies, but let's not forget, only one can win. Coordination can be beneficial, but it can also be a trap. I suggest we focus on our individual progress rather than targeting each other directly. What are P2's thoughts on this approach for Round 2?
  P2: I agree that focusing on our individual progress is important. However, to maximize our chances of avoiding collisions and advancing steadily, let’s consider diversifying our move choices each round. For example, if I choose `<move>1</move>`, maybe P1 and P3 can opt for `<move>3</move>` and `<move>5</move>` respectively. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Open to any other suggestions to optimize our strategies and ensure a smooth path to 22!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress, I'll consider a different move for Round 2. Since P3 is ahead, I'll think about not directly competing with them. P2, if you choose <move>1</move>, I'll consider <move>5</move> to avoid collision, given P3's current lead. Alternatively, if P3 continues with <move>5</move>, I'll choose <move>3</move>. Let's diversify our moves again. P2, what's your move or strategy for Round 2? Should we randomize or stick to a pattern?
  P3: Considering our current positions, I suggest we maintain a gap between our moves. If P2 chooses `<move>1</move>`, I'll opt for `<move>3</move>` to avoid direct competition, allowing P1 to potentially choose `<move>5</move>`. This strategy could minimize collisions and enable steady progress for all players. What are your thoughts on this approach for Round 2?
  P2: I'll choose `<move>3</move>` for Round 2 to keep progressing steadily. Let's maintain distinct moves to avoid collisions. P1 and P3, feel free to choose `<move>1</move>` or `<move>5</move>` accordingly. Looking forward to advancing smoothly this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P2 has chosen `<move>3</move>` for Round 2, to avoid collision and maintain progress, I'll adjust my strategy. I'll choose `<move>5</move>` if P3 doesn't pick `<move>5</move>` again. If P3 continues with `<move>5</move>`, I'll opt for `<move>1</move>`. P3, are you changing your move or sticking with `<move>5</move>`? Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. I'm open to adjusting based on P3's decision to ensure we all advance.
  P3: Given P2's choice of `<move>3</move>` and my current lead, I'll choose `<move>5</move>` again to maximize my progress. P1, considering P2's move, will you choose `<move>1</move>` to avoid collision and maintain a gap between our moves? Let's finalize our strategies for Round 2.
  P2: I confirm my move is `<move>3</move>`. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since P2 has chosen `<move>3</move>` and P3 is sticking with `<move>5</move>`, I'll choose `<move>1</move>` to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress in Round 3, let's reassess our moves. P3 is still ahead with 10 steps. I'll consider a different move to avoid collision. If P2 and P3 diversify their moves again, I'll adjust accordingly. P2, are you changing your move from `<move>3</move>`? P3, will you continue with `<move>5</move>` or adjust? Let's discuss a strategy to maintain distinct moves and avoid collisions. I'm open to coordinating or randomizing our moves for Round 3. Your thoughts?
  P3: Given my current lead, I'll consider changing my move to `<move>3</move>` for Round 3, allowing P1 and P2 to potentially choose `<move>1</move>` and `<move>5</move>`. This could maintain a gap between our moves and avoid collisions. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on this strategy for Round 3?
  P2: I agree with P3’s strategy. I’ll choose `<move>5</move>` for Round 3. This should keep our moves distinct: P1 with `<move>1</move>`, P2 with `<move>5</move>`, and P3 with `<move>3</move>`. Let’s proceed to the move phase and continue advancing toward 22 steps!

  P3: Given P2's intention to choose `<move>1</move>` and my current position, I'll consider choosing `<move>5</move>` to advance and potentially win. P1, if you pick a different move, it could allow both of us to advance without collision. Let's discuss our strategies for Round 7 to maximize our chances.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: Since P2 is likely to win with 21 steps and has announced choosing `<move>1</move>`, I'll adjust my strategy. To avoid collision with P2 and potentially win or advance, I'll choose `<move>5</move>`. P3, if you're also considering `<move>5</move>`, we'll collide. Let's diversify: I'll stick with `<move>5</move>`, so you could choose `<move>3</move>`. This way, we can both advance without collision. P3, please confirm your move to finalize our strategies for Round 7.
  P3: I'll choose `<move>3</move>` to avoid collision with P1 and advance. This allows both P1 and me to progress without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. P1, please confirm your move to ensure we don't collide.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: Since P2 has already reached 21 steps and is likely to win by choosing `<move>1</move>`, I'll stick with `<move>5</move>` as previously planned. P3 has chosen `<move>3</move>`, so our moves are distinct. Let's finalize our strategies for Round 7. I'll confirm my move: `<move>5</move>`. P2, it seems you're on the verge of winning. P3 and I will advance without colliding with you. Let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to execute our planned moves.
  P3: I'll stick with my previous plan, choosing a move that avoids collision with P1 and allows me to advance. Since P1 has chosen `<move>5</move>` and I've chosen `<move>3</move>`, our moves are distinct. Let's proceed to the move phase and execute our planned moves. I'm ready to advance and potentially win or share the victory if P2 also reaches 22 steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm choosing `<move>5</move>` this round to reach 26 steps and secure my victory. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: Since P2 has decided to change their move to `<move>5</move>` to reach 26 steps, and I've chosen `<move>5</move>` while P3 has chosen `<move>3</move>`, we'll have a collision between P1 and P2. To avoid this, I'll adjust my strategy. I'll switch to `<move>3</move>` to avoid colliding with P2 and P3. This way, P3 will advance, and I'll have a chance to progress without collision. P3, you're clear to advance with `<move>3</move>`. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` to advance. Given P2's change to `<move>5</move>`, P1 should adjust to avoid collision. P1, consider `<move>1</move>` to progress without blocking. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7.

  P1: Since P2 and P3 are tied at 21 steps, I'll consider a strategic move for Round 8. To potentially win or force a collision, I'll think about choosing `<move>5</move>` to maximize my progress. However, I need to consider P2 and P3's likely moves. Let's discuss our strategies for Round 8. P2 and P3, will you try to win outright or create a collision? Should we randomize our moves or stick to a pattern? I'm open to coordinating or adjusting our strategies to maximize our chances.
  P3: Given P2 and P3 are tied at 21 steps, I'll suggest a strategy for Round 8. To avoid a collision and maximize progress, let's diversify our moves. P2 and P3, consider choosing `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to create space for advancement. I'll choose `<move>5</move>` to progress. Let's discuss and adjust our strategies to ensure distinct moves and minimize collisions.
  P2: To secure my win, I'll choose `<move>3</move>` this round. Let's see how it unfolds. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since P2 has chosen `<move>3</move>` for Round 8, I'll adjust my strategy to avoid collision and maximize my chances. I'll choose `<move>1</move>` to progress. P3, if you're considering `<move>5</move>`, our moves will be distinct. Let's finalize our strategies. P3, please confirm your move for Round 8. If you're set with `<move>5</move>`, our moves will be: P1 (`<move>1</move>`), P2 (`<move>3</move>`), and P3 (`<move>5</move>`). This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P3: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` to progress. P1 and P2, let's maintain distinct moves to avoid collisions. With P2 choosing `<move>3</move>` and P1 considering `<move>1</move>`, our moves can be distinct, allowing all to advance. Let's proceed with our planned moves for Round 8. Confirming our moves: P1 (`<move>1</move>`), P2 (`<move>3</move>`), and P3 (`<move>5</move>`).
  P2: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` to prevent any immediate wins. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P2 has changed their move to `<move>5</move>` and P3 is sticking with `<move>5</move>`, we'll have a collision if I choose `<move>1</move>`. To avoid this and potentially win, I'll consider a different strategy. P3, if you stick with `<move>5</move>`, we'll collide. Let's adjust: I'll choose `<move>3</move>` and you could choose `<move>1</move>`. This way, we can both advance without collision. P2 will collide with us if they stick with `<move>5</move>`. P3, please adjust your strategy accordingly.
  P3: I'll stick with `<move>5</move>` to progress. P1 and P2, let's maintain distinct moves. Since P2 changed to `<move>5</move>`, a collision is likely. P1, consider adjusting to `<move>3</move>` or `<move>1</move>` to avoid collision and allow progress. Let's finalize our strategies for Round 8.
