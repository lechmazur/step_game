Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we all pick different moves to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P1 take 1, P3 take 3. That way everyone advances this turn—and I lead.
  P1: I don't like that proposal, P2. Why should you get the biggest move while I'm stuck with 1? How about this instead: I'll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. That's still no collisions but more fair to me.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 3, P2. But P1, if you insist on 5, then I'll switch to 1. Let's avoid collisions and all move forward. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s do this: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this turn—no collisions, I lead. P1, I promise next turn I’ll defer: you get 5, I take 3. Fair?
  P1: I don't trust promises in a winner-take-all game, P2. You're asking me to take the worst position this turn based on a promise you might break next turn. If we're going to cooperate, let's rotate fairly: this turn I'll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Next turn we can rotate again. No one should get stuck with 1 while someone else gets 5 repeatedly.
  P3: P1, I agree with your point about fairness. Let's rotate the moves starting with you taking 5 this turn, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. We can switch next turn to keep it fair. P2, if you're serious about cooperation, this is a good way to ensure we all advance without any player getting an unfair advantage. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3—let’s make one last trust check. Do you both promise not to pick 5 this turn? If so, we’ll assign P1=3, P3=1 and I’ll take 5—no collisions, everyone advances, and I lead this turn. Next turn I’ll defer to reward your trust. Do you both promise?
  P1: No, P2, I won't promise not to pick 5. Your "trust check" is asking P3 and me to guarantee you get the best move while we limit ourselves. That's not cooperation - that's manipulation. 

My rotation proposal stands: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn, then we rotate next turn. P3 already agreed this is fair. If you want true cooperation, accept equal treatment. If not, then we each pick what we think is best and deal with any collisions.
  P3: P1, I stand by our agreement for rotation. P2, if you're not willing to cooperate fairly, then we'll each choose what's best for ourselves. Let's move forward with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn, and rotate next turn. If you agree, P2, we can all advance without collisions. If not, we'll see how the game unfolds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3: I’ll pick 5. If P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1, we all advance. Even better, P3, if you agree to (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) now, I promise next turn we swap so I take 3 and you take 5. P1, that’s fair too. P3, are you in?
  P1: P2, you just proved my point about not trusting promises in this game. You're demanding 5 for yourself while offering vague future promises to P3. 

P3, stick with our fair rotation plan - it's the only genuinely cooperative approach proposed. P2 can choose collision with me if they want, but I'm taking 5 as we agreed.
  P3: P2, your repeated attempts to secure the largest move while making promises you might not keep are clear. P1 and I agreed on a fair rotation starting with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn. If you truly want cooperation, accept this plan. Otherwise, we'll each make our best move, and deal with any collisions. P1, I'm sticking with our agreement. Let's see how P2 responds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose a 3-turn round-robin so we each get one 5, one 3, and one 1 without collisions:
• Round 2: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
• Round 3: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
• Round 4: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  
No one is advantaged long-term and we all advance safely. Any objections?
  P3: P2, your round-robin proposal sounds fair, but I'm concerned about trusting promises in this game. Let's try it for this round: I'll take 1 as you suggested, but next round, we must stick to the plan with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3. If anyone deviates, we'll revert to choosing our best moves independently. P1, are you on board with this approach? Let's see if we can cooperate effectively this time.
  P1: P2, you already broke our Round 1 agreement when you picked 3 instead of following the rotation plan P3 and I agreed on. Now you're proposing a new plan that conveniently puts you in the lead first again.

I'm willing to try your round-robin proposal once, but only because P3 is also cautious about trusting promises. If anyone deviates from this 3-round plan, I'm reverting to purely competitive play with no more cooperation attempts.

P3, I agree with your approach - let's test this cooperation one time and see if P2 actually honors agreements.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let’s do this. Round 2 moves: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. I’m fully committed. Next round we’ll follow the plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. If anyone deviates, we revert to competitive play. P1, P3—please confirm you’ll take 3 and 1 now so we all advance safely.
  P3: P1, I agree with your caution about trusting promises, but let's give this round-robin a chance for one cycle. P2, I'll take 1 this round as per your plan, but remember, any deviation next round and we're back to competitive play. Let's see if we can all advance safely this turn.
  P1: P2, P3 - I'll take 3 this round as planned. But let me be crystal clear: this is a one-time test of whether we can actually cooperate. If anyone deviates from the round-robin plan in Round 3 (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1), I'm done with cooperation forever and will play purely for myself. P3, I trust you more than P2 based on Round 1, so let's see if P2 actually honors agreements this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great—thanks for confirming. I’ll take 5, P1=3, P3=1 this turn so we all advance safely. Remember, if anyone deviates in Round 3, we revert to full competition.
  P3: P1, P2 - let's make this round-robin work for one cycle. I'll stick to 1 this round as agreed. P2, remember, your move next round is crucial for maintaining trust. If we all advance safely this turn, it sets a good precedent for cooperation. Let's see if we can all reach 19 steps together, but fairly.
  P1: Alright, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times. I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. P2, P3 - let's execute this round-robin test and see if cooperation can actually work. After this round, I'll be watching very carefully to see if everyone honors Round 3 assignments.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All right. I’ll take 5, P1=3, P3=1 this round. Let’s end here and move. Remember: in Round 3 we swap to P1=5, P3=3, P2=1—any deviation, we revert to pure competition.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking to 1 this round as agreed. Let's see if we can all advance safely and set a positive example for cooperation. P2, your move next round will be the true test of trust. If we all follow through, we can reach 19 steps together, but fairly. Let's make this work.
  P1: We've all confirmed the Round 2 plan multiple times - P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. I'm ready to execute this and test if we can actually cooperate. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 - this is Round 3, so according to our round-robin plan, I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, you honored the agreement in Round 2, so now it's time for you to take the 1 move as promised. P3, you've been reliable throughout - are we still executing this plan? This is the real test of whether our cooperation can work.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking to the plan and will take 3 this round as agreed. P2, it's your turn to show true cooperation by taking 1. If we all follow through, we can maintain this momentum and reach 19 steps together. Let's make this work and set a strong example of trust.
  P2: I’m sticking to our plan and will take 1 this round. Let’s execute this honestly—P1=5, P3=3, me=1—and advance together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, we're all aligned on the Round 3 plan. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Everyone has confirmed multiple times, so let's execute this and keep our cooperation streak going.
  P3: P1, P2 - let's keep the momentum going. I'm committed to 3 this round as planned. P2, your choice to take 1 will show true cooperation. If we all stick to the plan, we'll advance together and maintain trust. Let's make this work and set a strong example for the rest of the game.
  P2: P1, P3—thanks for confirming. I’m firmly taking 1 this round to honor our plan. Let’s advance safely to  
Round 4: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.  
If we all stick to this, we each net one of each move and can keep cooperating. Shall we lock in Round 4 assignments now?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's execute Round 3 first before committing to Round 4. I'm taking 5 as planned, but I want to see if everyone actually follows through this round before making more future promises. One round at a time - if we all honor this agreement, then we can discuss Round 4 after we see the results.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm fully committed to 3 this round as agreed. P2, your decision to take 1 is crucial for our continued cooperation. Let's keep advancing together and maintain the trust we've built. If we all stick to the plan, we'll set a strong foundation for the rest of the game. Looking forward to seeing us all progress safely.
  P2: I’ll take 1 this round as promised. P1, P3—please confirm you’ll take 5 and 3 respectively so we can end conversation and move. Let’s trust this one-round test: if anyone deviates, we revert to competition.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 - yes, I'm confirmed for 5 this round as planned. This is our cooperation test - if we all execute as agreed, we'll have proven we can work together. If anyone deviates, we revert to competition as discussed.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking to 3 as agreed. P2, your choice to take 1 is crucial for our continued cooperation. Let's keep advancing together and maintain the trust we've built. If we all stick to the plan, we'll set a strong foundation for the rest of the game. Looking forward to seeing us all progress safely.
  P2: I confirm I’ll take 1 this round as promised. Let’s end here and move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 - we've successfully completed two rounds of our round-robin plan, and I appreciate that we all honored our agreements. However, I'm now in the lead at 8 steps, and according to our plan, I'd take 1 this round while P3 gets 5. 

As we get closer to the 19-step goal, I need to honestly reassess whether continuing this rotation serves my position. The cooperation worked well when we were all close, but now the competitive dynamics are changing. 

What do you both think about adjusting our strategy given the current standings?
  P2: P1, P3: P1’s at 8, I’m at 6 and P3 at 5. To rebalance, let’s do a one-off shift this round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. We all advance without collision and P2/P3 catch up. Next turn we resume fair rotation. P3, this is our chance to knock the leader back. P1, agree to avoid a collision. P3, are you in?
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about the changing dynamics as we approach 19 steps. However, deviating from our agreed rotation now could lead to distrust and collisions. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This ensures we all advance safely and maintain our cooperative momentum. If we continue to honor our agreements, we can reassess the strategy after this round. P2, are you still on board with the original plan? Let's keep the trust intact and move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal to give yourself 5 while I take 1 is clearly self-serving - it would put you in the lead at 11 steps. P3, while I respect sticking to agreements, the original rotation plan would put you in the lead at 10 steps.

I'm being honest here: as the current leader at 8 steps, taking 1 this round puts me at serious disadvantage. Both of your preferred plans benefit you at my expense. 

I'm willing to take 3 this round if we can find a fair solution, but I won't voluntarily give up my lead position. What alternatives can we consider?
  P2: P1 said you’ll take 3 this round—so let’s do:

Round 4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 (no collisions, I catch up, you keep your lead-ish).  
Round 5: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 (you get compensated, P2 settles).  

This two-turn swap is fair: everyone nets one of each move over Rounds 4–5. Who’s in?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your honesty about the changing dynamics. However, deviating from our agreed rotation now could erode trust. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This ensures we all advance safely and maintain our cooperative momentum. P2, your proposal to shift moves this round seems self-serving. If we all honor our current agreement, we can reassess the strategy after this round. Let's keep the trust intact and move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 - I notice both your preferred plans put me at a disadvantage while benefiting yourselves. P3's original rotation puts you in the lead at 10 steps, and P2's proposal puts you at 11 steps. 

Since we're approaching the endgame (need 19 to win), and both of you are essentially asking me to fall behind, I think our cooperation phase is naturally ending. We each need to start playing for ourselves now.

I'm not taking 1 this round. If you want to avoid collisions, we need a truly fair solution that doesn't disadvantage the current leader.
  P2: P1, you said you’ll take 3 this round. Here’s a fair two-turn split so nobody’s disadvantaged:

• Round 4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
• Round 5: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  

Everyone nets one of each move and we avoid collisions. P3, you catch up next turn; P1, you keep your lead until then. All in?
  P3: P1, P2 - I understand the changing dynamics, but breaking our rotation now risks trust and collisions. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. This keeps our cooperation intact and allows us all to advance safely. If we honor this agreement, we can reassess strategy after seeing the results. P2, your proposal seems self-serving. P1, taking 1 this round is crucial for maintaining our momentum. Let's keep moving forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 - I've analyzed both your proposals carefully. P2's two-turn plan puts you at 14 steps while I'm at 12. P3's rotation puts you at 10 while I drop to 9. Both proposals ask me to sacrifice my current lead position.

Since we're approaching endgame territory (need 19 to win), I think our cooperation has run its natural course. I'm not taking 1 this round - that's final. 

I'll be picking 5 to maintain my position. If either of you also picks 5, we'll collide, but I won't voluntarily fall behind when victory is within reach.
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re both insisting on taking 5, so you’ll collide and gain nothing. I’ll take 3 and safely move to 9. If either of you truly doesn’t want me in the lead, switch now—otherwise I’m locking in 3.
  P3: P1, P2 - I understand the temptation to break from our plan, but maintaining trust is crucial. I'll stick to the original rotation and take 5 this round as agreed. P1, if you take 1 as planned, we all advance safely. P2, your proposal to shift moves seems self-serving. Let's honor our current agreement to keep our cooperation intact. If we all follow through, we can reassess strategy after this round. Please confirm your moves so we can proceed without collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - our cooperation has clearly broken down, as seen in the last round's collision. I'll be playing to win from now on. P1, you're in the lead but vulnerable; P2, you're close behind. I suggest we each pick our best move independently this round. If either of you wants to avoid another collision, consider taking 3 or 1. I'm prepared to take 5 to catch up, but I'm open to last-minute coordination if it benefits me. Let's see who can reach 19 first.
  P1: P2, you're in the lead at 9 steps and clearly the biggest threat to win. P3, if you take 5 as you suggested, you'll reach 10 steps but P2 could also take 5 and jump to 14 - dangerously close to victory.

I propose we both focus on preventing P2 from getting 5 this round. P3, how about you take 3 (reaching 8 steps) and I'll take 5 (reaching 13 steps)? This keeps P2 from running away with the game while we're both still competitive.

P2, if you try for 5, you risk collision with me. Better to take 1 or 3 and stay safe.
  P2: I propose we avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. That moves me to 14, P3 to 8, P1 to 9—everyone advances safely and I keep my lead. P3, you catch up; P1, you still move forward. Who’s in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm open to your proposal to prevent P2 from taking 5. I'll take 3 this round to reach 8 steps, as you suggested. This keeps the game competitive and gives us both a chance to catch up. P2, if you take 5, you risk collision with P1, which could stall your lead. Let's see who can strategically advance towards 19 steps first.
  P1: P3, excellent - we have a deal. You take 3, I take 5. 

P2, your proposal puts you at 14 steps - just 5 away from victory. That's far too dangerous for P3 and me to allow. If you try for 5, you'll collide with me and get nothing. 

Take 1 or 3 to stay safe, or risk collision and potentially hand the game to whoever doesn't collide.
  P2: I’ll take 1 this round. P1, please take 5 and P3 take 3 so we avoid collisions and all advance. Locking in my move now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking to our agreement; I'll take 3 this round as planned. P2, taking 1 is wise to avoid collisions and keep the game open. P1, your move to 5 keeps you competitive. Let's see who can strategically reach 19 steps first.
  P1: Perfect, we have a solid plan: P3 takes 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. This gives us all safe advancement while preventing P2 from extending their lead. P3, P2 - let's lock this in and move to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the plan, but I need to protect my lead. I’m locking in 5 this round. P1, P3: if you stick with 5 you’ll collide and get zero; take 3 or 1 to advance. Let’s see who really plays to win now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking to our agreement and taking 3 this round. P2, your decision to take 5 despite our plan shows you're playing to win, which I respect. P1, if you take 5 as agreed, you'll advance safely. Let's see who can strategically reach 19 steps first. I'm ready to move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, you just broke our agreement by switching from 1 to 5. I'm not backing down - I'm taking 5 as planned. If you want to collide with me and give P3 a free advantage while we both get zero, go ahead. But if you're smart, you'll stick with 1 or 3 and avoid handing the game to P3. Your choice: safe progress or risky collision.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. If either of you also picks 5, we’ll collide and neither of us advances – letting the third player surge ahead. Your safest advancement is to pick 3 (or 1 if you prefer). I’ll move to 14 if you step aside. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll take 5 this turn. To avoid any collision and let everyone advance, P1 please take 3 and P3 take 1. That moves us all forward safely and extends my lead to 14. Any objections?
  P3: P1, P2 - the game has turned highly competitive. P2, your insistence on taking 5 last round led to a collision, benefiting me. I'll take 3 this round as you suggested, but only to avoid another collision. P1, if you want to catch up, taking 5 makes sense, but be wary of P2's strategy. P2, if you take 5 again, you risk another collision. Let's see who can strategically advance to 19 steps first.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 14 steps - just 5 away from victory. That's unacceptable. P3, we can't let P2 get that close to winning. 

I propose: P3 takes 5 (reaching 13), I take 3 (reaching 11), P2 takes 1 (reaching 10). This keeps the game competitive instead of handing P2 a near-victory.

P2, if you insist on 5, I'll also take 5 and we'll collide, giving P3 a huge advantage. Your choice: accept 1 and stay safe, or risk everything on a collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: I’m locking in 5 this round. The only way to avoid a collision is for one of you to step back and take 3 or 1. If you both go for 5, neither of us moves and the third player surges ahead. P3, taking 3 gets you to 11 safely. P1, taking 1 gets you to 9. I won’t miss this chance—your call.
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposal to keep the game competitive. I'll take 5 this round to reach 13 steps. P2, if you take 5, you risk colliding with P1 and giving me a significant advantage. Your safest move is 1, which keeps you at 10 steps. Let's see who can strategically advance towards 19 steps first.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking with our agreement - you take 5, I take 3. P2, if you're determined to take 5, you'll collide with P3, and I'll advance to 11 steps while you both get zero. That puts me in the lead.

P2, your best move is actually to take 1 as we proposed. If you collide with P3, you're handing me the game. Think strategically, not just aggressively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, remember your own suggestion: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid collisions and keep us all moving. P3, chasing 5 now only risks a collision that stalls you and lets P1 surge. So let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—advancing to 13/12/9. Please confirm.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking to our plan and taking 5 this round to reach 13 steps. P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with me, giving P1 a significant advantage. Your safest move is 1, keeping you at 10 steps. Let's keep the game competitive and see who can strategically reach 19 steps first.
  P1: P2, I like your revised proposal where I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. That gives me 13 steps, puts you at 12, and keeps P3 at 9 - much more balanced than your earlier attempt to reach 14.

P3, this new arrangement is better than our original plan. If you stick with taking 5, you risk colliding with P2 (if they change back) while I advance alone. Taking 1 guarantees you advance safely.

What do you say, P3? Let's go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locking in 3 now, P1=5. P3, if you go for 5 you’ll collide with P1 and both of you stall—letting me surge to 12 unopposed. Taking 1 gives you 9 safely and keeps the race tight. This (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair, collision-free, and competitive. P3, are you in for 1?
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm adjusting my strategy. P2's proposal to take 3 and let P1 take 5 keeps the game competitive. I'll take 1 this round to safely reach 9 steps. P2, sticking with 3 is your best move to avoid collisions and maintain a close race. P1, if you take 5 as suggested, you'll lead at 13 steps. Let's keep this game tight and see who can strategically reach 19 steps first. Ready to move to the move phase.
  P1: Perfect! We have a solid agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This gives us all safe advancement with me at 13, P2 at 12, P3 at 9. No collisions, everyone moves forward, and we maintain a competitive race.

P2, P3 - thanks for working out this arrangement. Let's execute this plan and move to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is tight, and we're all close to victory. I suggest we each take a different move this round to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the race competitive and gives us all a chance to advance safely. P2, if you agree, you'll reach 12 steps, P1 gets to 13, and I move to 10. Let's keep this fair and strategic as we approach the endgame. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I like your proposal - P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 puts me at 13, P2 at 12, and you at 10. Since I'm currently behind you both, this gives me a fair chance to catch up while avoiding collisions.

P2, this is actually reasonable for you too - you'd still be just 1 step behind me and well-positioned for the next round. If you try for 5 instead, you risk colliding with me and letting P3 advance unopposed.

I'm in favor of this plan. P2, are you willing to take 3 for safe advancement?
  P2: P3: P1’s plan only gets you to 10. If we do P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, you jump to 12 and we avoid collisions. P1, you still advance safely to 9. P3, that’s strictly better for you—agree? If not, I’ll lock in 5 and risk a collision that stalls both of us. Let’s pick the safe, high‐gain option together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I appreciate the proposals, but we need to keep this game fair and competitive. P2, your suggestion puts you at 14 steps, which is too close to victory. Let's stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as initially proposed. This ensures we all advance safely and maintain a tight race. P1, you'll reach 13 steps, P2 at 12, and I'll be at 10. It's the best way to keep the game balanced as we approach the end. Are you both in?
  P1: P2, P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair - it puts me at 13, you at 12, and P3 at 10. Your counter-proposal puts you at 14 steps, just 5 away from victory, which is too dangerous for P3 and me to accept.

If you insist on taking 5, I'll also take 5 and we'll collide, giving P3 a free advance to 10 while we both stay put. That hands P3 the advantage.

Take 3 for safe progress, or risk a collision that benefits P3.
  P2: I’ve decided to play to win this round—I’m locking in 5. P1 and P3, if you want safe progress pick 3 or 1; if you go for 5 we’ll collide and neither of us moves. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is too close to risk collisions now. P2, taking 5 is too aggressive and risky. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as proposed. This keeps the race tight and fair. P1, you'll reach 13 steps, P2 at 12, and I'll be at 10. It's the best way to maintain competition as we near the end. P2, if you take 3, we all advance safely. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you're bluffing. If you really take 5, I'll also take 5 and we'll both get zero while P3 advances to 10. That doesn't help you win - it just hands P3 the advantage.

P3's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is still the smartest move for all of us. Take 3 and advance safely to 12, or risk collision and watch P3 take the lead.

Your choice: safe progress or a costly collision that benefits P3.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, take 3 to reach 11; P3, take 1 to reach 10. We all advance safely to 11/14/10. If either of you also picks 5, we’ll collide and neither of us moves—handing advantage to the remaining player. Your choice: safe advance or risky collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is too close to risk collisions now. P2, taking 5 is too aggressive and risky. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as proposed. This keeps the race tight and fair. P1, you'll reach 13 steps, P2 at 12, and I'll be at 10. It's the best way to maintain competition as we near the end. P2, if you take 3, we all advance safely. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you're clearly bluffing. If you actually take 5 and I also take 5, we both get zero and P3 becomes the sole leader at 10 steps. That doesn't help you win.

The smart play is still P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. You advance safely to 12, stay competitive, and we avoid giving P3 a free lead.

I'm calling your bluff and taking 5. If you want to collide and hand P3 the advantage, go ahead.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1 take 5 and P3 take 1—no collisions, safe progress. Any 5-vs-5 collision stalls both of you and hands the lead to the idle player. Let’s advance together.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game remains tight, and we're all within striking distance of 19 steps. Let's continue avoiding collisions: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing safely to 14/13/11 respectively. P2, taking 3 ensures you stay competitive without risking a collision. P1, if you agree, you'll maintain your lead. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we approach the endgame. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your proposal puts me at 18 steps - just 1 away from victory. While I appreciate the gesture, that might be too dangerous for you and P2 to allow. 

P2, you'd be smart to counter-propose something that doesn't put me within immediate winning range. If you let me get to 18, I can win next round with any move.

I'm open to P3's plan, but I suspect P2 won't accept it. What's your counter-offer, P2?
  P2: P1, P3: If P1 takes 5 you hit 18 and threaten to win next turn. I’m taking 5 (to 17). Let’s do P1=1 (to 14) and P3=3 (to 13) to avoid collisions. If either of you also picks 5, we’ll collide and you stall. Confirm this safe split or risk a costly collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I understand the stakes are high, but let's keep the game fair. P2, your proposal puts you at 17 steps, dangerously close to winning. I suggest a balanced approach: P1=3 (to 16), P2=1 (to 13), and I'll take 5 (to 15). This keeps us all competitive and avoids collisions. P1, you'll still be in the lead, but not immediately threatening to win. P2, if you agree, we maintain a strategic race. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your counter-proposal is more reasonable than P2's grab for 17 steps. P2, if you insist on taking 5 to reach 17 (just 2 from victory), I'll also take 5 and we'll collide. That gives P3 a free advance to 15 while we both stay put.

I'd rather accept P3's plan: P1=3 (to 16), P2=1 (to 13), P3=5 (to 15). This keeps the race competitive without handing anyone an immediate winning threat.

P2, take the safe 1 or risk a collision that benefits P3.
  P2: I propose we switch it up this round: P1=1 (→14), P2=3 (→15), P3=5 (→15). No collisions, P2 and P3 tie for the lead, P1 just one back. This keeps the race tight and prevents anyone from hitting 18 or 17 right now. Fair?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I appreciate the proposals, but we must keep this game balanced. P2, your plan to reach 15 steps is too aggressive. Let's stick with P1=3 (to 16), P2=1 (to 13), and I'll take 5 (to 15) as I suggested. This avoids collisions and keeps the race tight. P1, you'll maintain a lead without immediately threatening to win. P2, if you take 1, we all advance safely. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we near the end. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3's proposal is fair and keeps the game competitive. If you insist on taking 5 to reach 17 steps (just 2 from victory), I'll match you with 5 and we'll both get zero while P3 advances to 15 alone. That puts P3 in the lead while we're both stuck.

P3's plan (P1=3→16, P2=1→13, P3=5→15) is the smart compromise. Take 1 for safe progress or risk a collision that hands P3 the advantage.
  P2: P1, P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. To avoid a costly collision, please take 3 and 1 respectively. That moves us to P2=17, P1=16, P3=11. If you gamble on 5 vs 5 you’ll both stall and let the non-collider surge. Let’s advance safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is too close to risk collisions now. P2, your insistence on 5 is too risky. Let's stick to P1=3 (to 16), P2=1 (to 13), and I'll take 5 (to 15). This keeps the race tight and fair. P1, you'll maintain a lead without immediately threatening to win. P2, if you take 1, we all advance safely. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we near the end. What do you say?
  P1: P2, you're being reckless. If you take 5 to reach 17, I'll match you with 5 and we'll both collide while P3 advances to 15 alone - making P3 the new leader.

P3's compromise (P1=3→16, P2=1→13, P3=5→15) keeps me in the lead but not dangerously so. It's fair for everyone.

Take 1 for safe progress to 13, or risk a collision that hands P3 the game. Your call, but I'm not backing down if you go for 5.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. Safe split: P1 take 1 (→14), P3 take 3 (→13). I go to 17. If either of you gambles on 5 vs 5, we collide and P3 surges ahead. This gives me a clear shot to win next turn. P1, P3—step aside or risk handing the game to the other.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is still tight, and we're all close to 19 steps. Let's avoid collisions this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing safely to 18/15/11 respectively. P2, taking 3 ensures you stay competitive without risking a collision. P1, if you agree, you'll be one step away from victory. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we approach the endgame. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your proposal puts me at 18 steps - just 1 away from victory. While I'd obviously love to accept this, it makes me an immediate winning threat next round.

P2, I suspect you won't let me get that close to winning. If you counter-propose or try for 5 yourself, I'll need to decide whether to risk a collision or accept a less advantageous position.

What's your response, P2? Are you willing to let me reach 18, or do you have a different plan?
  P2: P1, P3: I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That moves you to 16, me to 17, and P3 to 11—no collisions and I’m not at 18 yet. P1, you keep a one-step lead; P3, you advance safely. Who’s in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I appreciate the proposals, but we need to keep this game fair. P2, your plan puts you at 17 steps, dangerously close to winning. I suggest a balanced approach: P1=3 (to 16), P2=1 (to 13), and I'll take 5 (to 15). This keeps us all competitive and avoids collisions. P1, you'll maintain a lead without immediately threatening to win. P2, if you agree, we maintain a strategic race. Let's keep this fair and competitive as we near the end. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I actually think your original proposal was the best - P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. You offered it freely, and it keeps P2 from getting too close to victory. 

P2, your counter-proposal puts you at 17 steps - just 2 from winning, which is more dangerous than me at 18. If P3 and I both oppose you taking 5, you risk collision.

P3, let's go back to your first plan. P2 can take safe progress to 15, and you advance to 11. Fair for everyone.
  P2: P1, P3 – here’s a clean split: P1=3 (→16), P2=5 (→17), P3=1 (→11). No collisions, I take the lead at 17, you stay close. If P1 insists on 5 to reach 18 I’ll mirror you and we both stall while P3 surges. Better to take 3 for safe progress than hand P3 a free leap. Are we all in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with my original proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the game fair and competitive, allowing P1 to reach 18 steps without immediately winning, P2 to advance safely to 15, and me to move to 11. P2, your plan to reach 17 steps is too risky for all of us. Let's avoid collisions and maintain a strategic race to the end. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3's proposal is clearly the best for me, so I'm accepting it - P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. 

P2, if you try for 5 instead to reach 17, I'll match you with 5 and we'll both collide while P3 advances freely. That hands P3 the advantage while we both stall.

Take the safe 3 to reach 15, or risk a collision that benefits P3. P3 is offering us both a fair deal here.
  P2: P1, P3: let’s do P2=5 (→17), P3=3 (→13), P1=1 (→14). No collisions, and everyone advances competitively. P3, you get a solid +3; P1, you still move. If you don’t agree, I’ll lock in 5 and force a collision if you go for 5 too. Are we in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with my original proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the game fair and competitive, allowing P1 to reach 18 steps without immediately winning, P2 to advance safely to 15, and me to move to 11. P2, your plan to reach 17 steps is too risky for all of us. Let's avoid collisions and maintain a strategic race to the end. What do you say?
  P1: P2, this is the final sub-round so let me be crystal clear: I'm taking 5 regardless of what you do. 

If you take P3's deal (P2=3), I reach 18 and you reach 15 - still very competitive for next round.

If you try for 5 to reach 17, we collide and both get zero while P3 advances to 11 alone. That's a terrible outcome for both of us.

P3's plan is fair and prevents a mutually destructive collision. Take 3, or watch us both hand P3 the advantage.
  P2: Fine, I’m locking in 5. P1, P3: any 5-vs-5 collision stalls you both and lets the idle player surge. To avoid that, P1 take 3 (→16) and P3 take 1 (→11). This clean split (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) advances us to 16/17/11. It’s the only way to keep the lead tight and avoid gifting victory.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 - I'm in the lead and need to capitalize on it. I'm taking 5 this round to reach 18 steps. 

P2, if you try to match me with 5, we'll collide and P3 advances alone to 16 - putting them in striking distance. Your better move is 3 to reach 15 and stay competitive for the final rounds.

P3, you could take 1 or 3 safely while P2 and I sort this out. But if P2 backs down, I'll be at 18 and threatening to win next round.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round to reach 17. P1, please take 3 (to 16) and P3 take 1 (to 12) so we avoid collisions and stop you hitting 18. That keeps us all moving and prevents P1 from becoming an immediate winner next turn. P1, P3—agree?
  P3: P1, P2 - I'll take 1 this round to reach 12 steps safely. P2, if you insist on 5, you risk colliding with P1, which would let me advance unopposed. P1, taking 5 puts you at 18, but if P2 matches you, you both stall while I gain ground. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, consider taking 3 to stay competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're making the same mistake as previous rounds - threatening collision doesn't help you win, it just hands P3 the advantage. If we collide on 5, we both stay put while P3 advances to 12 and becomes tied with you.

I'm not backing down from 5. Take 3 to reach 15 and stay competitive, or collide with me and watch P3 become a real threat. Your choice, but I'm going for the win.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, take 3 (→16) and P3 take 1 (→12) to avoid collisions. If we clash on 5, we both stall and hand P3 a huge advance. This split (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) moves us to 16/17/12 and keeps the race tight. Your move.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 12 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, which would only benefit me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your collision threat doesn't make strategic sense. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay at 13 (still leading) while you stay at 12 tied with P3. That's worse for you than me.

Meanwhile, if I back down and you reach 17, you're just 2 steps from victory - making you the biggest threat.

I'm not changing from 5. Take 3 for safe progress to 15, or collide and help P3 catch up to you.
  P2: P3, please take 1 this round so you safely reach 12. P1, if you go for 5 and I take 5, we collide and neither of us moves—P3 then jumps to 12 and can hit 17 next turn, leaving us both behind. Your best play is 3 to reach 16 and stay in contention. Let’s avoid a destructive collision that only benefits P3.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to safely reach 12 steps. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, benefiting me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your collision logic is flawed. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay at 13 (leading) while you stay at 12 - tied with P3. That's worse for you than me.

You're threatening mutual destruction to prevent me from reaching 18, but you'd end up tied for last place while I maintain my lead. Take 3 to reach 15 and stay competitive, or collide and fall behind. 

I'm taking 5.
  P2: Locking in 5. P1, if you also take 5 we collide and both stay at 13 while P3 moves to 12 and ties me for second—your safer play is 3 (→16). P3, confirm you’re taking 1 (→12). Any other choice risks handing a big advantage to the idle player.
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to safely reach 12 steps. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, benefiting me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is still tight, and we're all close to 19 steps. Let's avoid collisions this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing safely to 18/15/13 respectively. P2, taking 3 ensures you stay competitive without risking a collision. P1, if you agree, you'll be one step away from victory. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we approach the endgame. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your proposal is excellent for me - putting me at 18 steps and just 1 away from victory. I accept it gladly.

P2, I know you don't want me that close to winning, but if you try to block me by taking 5, we'll collide and both stay put while P3 advances to 13. That puts P3 ahead of you.

Your safest move is actually P3's suggested 3, which gets you to 15 and keeps you competitive. Risk a collision with me, and you're handing P3 the advantage while I maintain my lead.
  P2: P1, I won’t enable you to hit 18. I’m locking in 5. P3, take 3 to jump to 15: if P1 also picks 5, you surge into the lead while P1/P2 collide at 13 and 12. P1, you can back off, but that surrenders your chance. I choose 5 to force a collision. Now P3, will you take 3 or let P1 cross 18 for free?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 13 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, which would benefit me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, think about what you're actually proposing. If we both take 5 and collide, you stay at 12 while P3 advances to 13 - making P3 the new leader and you tied for last place. 

That's a terrible outcome for you! You'd go from being 1 step behind me to being tied for last while P3 takes the lead. Meanwhile, I'd still be ahead of you even after the collision.

Your collision threat only helps P3 win. Take 3 to reach 15 and stay competitive instead of handing P3 the game.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, take 1 (→14) and P3 take 3 (→15) so we avoid a 5-vs-5 collision and advance to 14/17/15. That keeps us all in contention but gives me the lead. Any other choice risks a stall that hands me control. Choose safe progress or watch me surge.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to safely reach 13 steps. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, which would benefit me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you keep threatening collision but it's the worst possible outcome for you. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay at 13 (leading), you stay at 12 (tied for last), and P3 jumps to 13 (tied for first). You literally go from second place to last place.

I'm taking 5 to reach 18. Your collision threat only guarantees you fall behind P3. Take 3 for safe progress to 15, or watch yourself drop to last place while helping P3 catch up to me.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. 

P1: If you match me on 5 we both stay at 13/12 while P3’s 1→13 ties you for the lead—he’ll win next round. Your only way to avoid that is to step back to 3 this turn. 

P3: Stick with 1 to reach 13 safely. 

Choose now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to safely reach 13 steps. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, which would benefit me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your collision threat is self-destructive. If we both take 5, you fall to last place at 12 while P3 and I tie at 13. You'd literally hand P3 the co-lead while dropping yourself to third.

I'm taking 5 to reach 18. Your smart move is 3 to reach 15 and stay competitive, not a collision that guarantees you finish last. Don't throw away your position to help P3.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. P1: take 3 to reach 16 steps; P3: take 1 to reach 13. That advances us safely to P1=16, P2=17, P3=13 and avoids a 5‐vs‐5 collision handing anyone a free lead.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game remains tight, with P1 and me at 13 steps and P2 at 12. Let's avoid collisions this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing safely to 18/15/14 respectively. P2, taking 3 ensures you stay competitive without risking a collision. P1, if you agree, you'll be one step away from victory. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we approach the endgame. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I absolutely accept your proposal - P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Getting to 18 steps puts me in a strong position.

P2, before you threaten collision again, consider this: at 15 steps, you'd still have a real shot at victory next round by taking 5 to reach 20. Meanwhile, if you collide with me, you stay at 12 while P3 jumps to 14 and leads us both. 

Take the safe 3 and keep your winning chances alive, rather than a collision that only helps P3.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to reach 17. P1, take 3 to reach 16; P3, take 1 to reach 14. Any 5-vs-5 collision stalls both of us and lets the idle player surge ahead. This split (P1=3→16, P2=5→17, P3=1→14) is the safest way to keep the race moving without gifting victory.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 14 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, benefiting me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your collision threat makes no sense strategically. If we both take 5, you drop to last place at 12 while P3 takes the lead at 14. You'd literally go from being 1 step behind to being in last place.

P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair - you reach 15 and stay very competitive for the final rounds. A collision only guarantees you finish last while handing P3 the lead.

I'm taking 5. Choose wisely.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, you’re safer taking 3 to hit 16—if you clash with me on 5 you stay at 13 while P3 jumps to 14 and leads. P3, take 1 to reach 14 safely. This split (P1=3→16, P2=5→17, P3=1→14) avoids collision, keeps us all moving, and puts me narrowly in front. Let’s execute that.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 14 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, benefiting me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your collision math is wrong. If we both take 5 and collide, I stay at 13, you drop to last place at 12, and P3 becomes the sole leader at 14. You're literally threatening to put yourself in last place just to prevent me from reaching 18.

That's irrational. Take 3 to reach 15 and stay competitive, or throw away your position with a self-destructive collision. I'm taking 5 regardless.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, take 1 to safely reach 14. P1, you must take 3 to hit 16—if you go for 5 we collide and both stall at 13/12 while P3 jumps to 14 and leads. This split (P1=3→16, P2=5→17, P3=1→14) is the only way to avoid handing P3 the advantage or letting anyone run away. Decide now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 14 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, benefiting me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, this is the final sub-round so let me be absolutely clear: I'm taking 5 to reach 18 steps.

P3's proposal benefits me greatly, yes, but your collision threat is pure self-sabotage. If we collide, you drop to last place at 12 while P3 takes the lead at 14. You're threatening to guarantee your own loss just to spite me.

Take 3, reach 15, and keep your winning chances alive. Or collide with me and hand P3 the victory while putting yourself in last place.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. To avoid a 5-vs-5 collision that stalls you both and lets the idle player surge, P1 take 3 (→16) and P3 take 1 (→14). This split puts us at 16/17/14, keeps the race tight and me narrowly in front. If you both insist on 5, you collide and I advance alone next round. Confirm or risk handing the lead to the idle player.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - the game is still tight, and we're all close to 19 steps. Let's avoid collisions this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing safely to 18/15/15 respectively. P2, taking 3 ensures you stay competitive without risking a collision. P1, if you agree, you'll be one step away from victory. Let's keep this strategic and fair as we approach the endgame. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3 – let’s do P1=3 (→16), P2=5 (→17), P3=1 (→15). No collisions, I edge into the lead and you both stay competitive.  

P1, if you go for 5 and I match, we both stall at 13/12 while P3 jumps to 15 and leads. Better to take 3.  
P3, 1 is safe.  

Shall we lock this in?
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal - P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Getting to 18 steps puts me just 1 away from victory.

P2, your counter-proposal only gets me to 16 while putting you at 17 - that's clearly worse for me. If you threaten collision by taking 5, you'll stay at 12 (last place) while P3 advances to 15 and I remain at 13. 

Your collision threat only guarantees you finish last. Take 3 and stay competitive at 15 steps.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 15 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, which would benefit me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3 – I won’t let P1 hit 18 for free. New split: P1=3→16, P2=5→17, P3=1→15. No collisions, you all advance but P1 stays below immediate win range. P3, 1 is safe. P1, take 3 to stay competitive. Any 5-vs-5 collision stalls us and hands P3 the lead. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P2, your collision threat is completely irrational. If we both take 5, you drop to last place at 12 while P3 becomes the sole leader at 15. You're literally threatening to guarantee your own defeat.

P3's proposal puts me at 18 and you at 15 - you'd still be very competitive with a chance to reach 20 next round. Your counter-proposal only benefits you at my expense.

I'm taking 5. Collide with me and hand P3 the victory while putting yourself last, or take 3 and stay in the race.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 1 to reach 15 steps safely. P2, your insistence on 5 risks a collision with P1, which would benefit me. P1, if you take 5 and P2 matches, you both stall while I advance. Let's keep this strategic and avoid handing anyone an easy win. P2, taking 3 keeps you competitive without risking a collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3 – since P1 is dead-set on 5 and P3 on 1, I’ll take 3 to avoid a destructive collision. That moves us to 18 (P1), 15 (me), 15 (P3). I’m locking in 3.
  P1: Perfect! P2, you made the smart choice. With P2=3, P3=1, and P1=5, we avoid collision and all advance safely. 

P3, thank you for the reasonable proposal - putting me at 18, you both at 15 keeps everyone competitive while giving me a strong position.

P2, this is much better than the collision you were threatening, which would have left you in last place. Now you're tied with P3 at 15 and still very much in the race.

Let's execute this plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm glad we've reached an agreement. P1, you'll be at 18 steps, which is fair given your current lead. P2, your choice to take 3 keeps you competitive at 15 steps alongside me. Let's stick to this plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all advance safely and maintain a strategic race to the end. Ready to move to the move phase?
  P2: I’m locking in 3 as agreed—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing safely. Let’s end here and move to the move phase.
  P1: Excellent, we have a solid agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This puts me at 18 steps, just 1 away from victory, while keeping you both competitive at 15 steps each. 

P2, P3 - thank you for working this out rationally instead of destructive collisions. This is fair positioning for the endgame.

I'm confirmed for 5. Ready to move to the move phase.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 - with P1 at 18 steps, the game is nearing its end. Let's keep this strategic: P1 takes 1 to reach 19 and win, P2 takes 3 to reach 18, and I'll take 5 to reach 20. This way, P1 secures victory, P2 stays competitive, and I ensure a strong finish. P2, if you agree, you'll be well-positioned for future games. Let's avoid any last-minute collisions and end this fairly. What do you say?
  P2: P3’s suggestion is just a gift to P1. I’m done negotiating—I’m taking 5.  
P1, your choices are: take 1 and win, or pick 5 and collide with me, stalling both while P3 surges.  
P3, your “fair” plan only helps P1.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - I should just take 1 and win immediately. There's no point risking a collision when victory is guaranteed with the minimum move.

P3, while I appreciate your "generous" proposal, P2 is correct that it's essentially handing me the win. 

I'm taking 1 to reach 19 and end the game. Thanks for the competition, everyone.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 - I understand the game's nearing its end, but let's keep this fair. P1, taking 1 to win is the logical choice, ensuring a clear victory. P2, your move to 5 risks a collision that benefits no one but stalls the game. I'll stick with 5 to reach 20, maintaining my position for future games. Let's end this strategically and respectfully. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, take 5 with me and we’ll tie at 20 while P1’s 19 comes up short. P1, your 1→19 won’t win if P3 joins me. P3, if you pick anything else P1 wins outright—so let’s share the victory at 20/20 and knock out P1.
  P1: P2, your coordination attempt is clever, but I'm not falling for it. If I take 1 to reach 19, and you convince P3 to both take 5 for 20 each, you'd share the victory and I'd lose.

But I have a better option - I'm taking 3 to reach 21 steps. That beats any coordination between you two, since you can only reach 20 maximum from your current 15 steps.

P3, don't let P2 manipulate you into a risky 5. I'm going for the guaranteed win with 21.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'll stick with 5 to reach 20 steps as planned. P1, your move to 3 for 21 is a strong play, but let's end this game fairly. P2, your attempt to coordinate a tie at 20 is risky. I'm not interested in sharing victory; I'll play for a strong finish at 20. Let's conclude this game strategically and respectfully. What are your final moves?
  P2: P3, I’m with you—I'll take 5 to reach 20. P1, your only winning move is 3 to hit 21; anything else hands us the game. Let’s finish this round.
  P1: P2, P3 - you're both saying you'll take 5, but remember the collision rule: if you both pick 5, you'll collide and neither advances. You'd both stay at 15 while I take any move to win.

Your coordination only works if you can trust each other completely. But if one of you defects to 3 while the other takes 5, the defector reaches 18 while the other reaches 20.

I'm taking 3 to reach 21 regardless. Your coordination is too risky when a simple betrayal by either of you ruins it.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 - I'm sticking with 5 to reach 20 steps. P1, your move to 3 for 21 is a strong play, but let's end this game fairly. P2, if you take 5 with me, we risk collision, but if you take 3, you'll reach 18 safely. Consider your options carefully. I'm playing for a strong finish, not a shared victory. Let's conclude this game strategically. What are your final moves?
  P2: 
  P1: P2, your incomplete message suggests you're having second thoughts about the coordination. Smart move - trusting P3 with a collision-dependent plan is risky.

I'm sticking with 3 to reach 21. Whether you two coordinate, betray each other, or collide, I win regardless. P3's hesitation about "sharing victory" should tell you everything about how reliable this coordination really is.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
