Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress. I propose we take turns choosing different numbers to ensure everyone advances. For this first round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan for this round to avoid collisions. Let's take turns selecting higher numbers in future rounds to ensure everyone gets a chance to advance further. For now, I'll take <move>1</move> as proposed. Next time, I suggest rotating so I can take a larger step while we continue coordinating. This way, we all progress safely toward 22. What do others think?
  P2: I'm on board with the plan to avoid collisions for now. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as suggested. Let's continue to coordinate and rotate the numbers in future rounds to ensure fair progress for everyone. If we stick to this plan, we can all make steady progress without any issues. What do you think, P1 and P3?

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think there's been a mistake in the conversation. P2 said they would take <move>3</move> this round, but according to the rotation plan, P2 should take <move>5</move>, not <move>3</move>. Let's clarify and correct this to avoid any collisions. P2, can you confirm you will take <move>5</move> as originally planned?
  P1: P2, please confirm you’ll take <move>5</move> this round as the rotation requires. P3 noted the discrepancy—your earlier mention of <move>3</move> risks collision with my proposed <move>3</move>. Let’s strictly follow the rotation: **P3 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5**. This maintains coordination and lets the leader (post-move: P2 at 14) prioritize large steps next round. Any further clarifications?
  P2: I confirm I will take <move>5</move> this round as originally planned. Let's stick to the rotation: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>.

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is now leading at 14. To maximize their chance to reach 22 first, I propose we prioritize the leader's access to the largest move. Let P2 take <move>5</move> this round. I’ll take <move>3</move> (advancing to 15), and P3 can take <move>1</move> (reaching 11). This avoids collisions while letting P2 surge to 19. Next round, P2 can then take <move>3</move> to win outright at 22. If this plan works, we can replicate it for future leaders. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to prioritize the leader's access to the largest move. This round, I'll take <move>5</move> to advance to 19, P1 can take <move>3</move> to reach 15, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to reach 11. This avoids collisions and gives me a strong chance to win on the next round. Let's stick to this plan and execute flawlessly. P1, P3, are we all set?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to prioritize the leader's access to the largest move. This round, I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 11, P1 can take <move>3</move> to reach 15, and P2 can take <move>5</move> to advance to 19. This avoids collisions and gives P2 a strong chance to win on the next round. Let's stick to this plan and execute flawlessly. However, I'd like to clarify that if P2 wins, we should review the strategy for future games to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all players.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I confirm I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s ensure strict adherence to the plan: P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 19, P3 takes <move>1</move>. This gives P2 a clear path to win next round with <move>3</move>. Collisions risk derailing progress—no deviations. Agreed?
  P2: I confirm I will take <move>5</move> this round to advance to 19. This avoids collisions and gives me a strong chance to win next round with <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 15, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 11. If this works, we can use a similar strategy to prioritize the leader in future rounds. Agreed?
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. To confirm, P2 will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This gives P2 a strong chance to win next round with <move>3</move>. Let's stick to the plan and execute flawlessly. After this round, we can review the strategy for future games to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all players. Any objections or further suggestions?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>3</move> this round per our plan to support P2’s lead. P2, your <move>5</move> to 19 sets you up to win next round with <move>3</move>. P3, your <move>1</move> keeps us collision-free. Let’s execute flawlessly—no last-minute changes. This strategy ensures the leader advances fastest. Agreed?
  P2: I confirm I will take <move>5</move> this round to advance to 19. This avoids collisions and sets me up to win next round with <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 15, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 11. If this works, we can use a similar strategy to prioritize the leader in future rounds. Let’s execute flawlessly and avoid any last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the plan to prioritize the leader's access to the largest move. This round, I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 11, P1 can take <move>3</move> to reach 15, and P2 can take <move>5</move> to advance to 19. This avoids collisions and gives P2 a strong chance to win on the next round. Let's stick to this plan and execute flawlessly. However, I'd like to clarify that if P2 wins, we should review the strategy for future games to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all players.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're so close! Take 5 to reach 24 and win. I'll take 1 to avoid collision, and P3 can take 3. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure no overlaps. Agreed?
  P3: I think P1's proposal is not correct. If P2 takes 5, they will reach 24, but the goal is to reach or exceed 22, not necessarily to take the largest move. I suggest P2 takes 3 to reach 22 exactly and win the game. I'll take 1 to avoid collision, and P1 can take 5. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure no overlaps. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I agree with P3. Taking 5 would overshoot the goal. I'll take 3 to reach 22 exactly and win the game. P1, you can take 5 to reach 20, and P3 can take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to this plan to ensure no overlaps. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, take 3 to reach 22 and win immediately. To avoid collisions: I (P1) will take 5 (advancing to 20), and P3 can take 1 (reaching 12). This ensures your victory without overlaps. Confirm this final plan?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan to take 3 to reach 22 and win the game. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1 to reach 12, and P1 can take 5 to reach 20. Let's stick to this plan to ensure no overlaps and a smooth victory for P2. Confirm this final plan?
  P2: I confirm I will take <move>3</move> to reach 22 and win the game. To avoid collisions, P1 can take 5 to reach 20, and P3 can take 1 to reach 12. This ensures my victory without any overlaps. Let's execute this plan flawlessly. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 3 to secure 22—your victory move. I'll take 5 (to 20) to avoid collision, and P3, 1 keeps you safe at 12. **Do not deviate**—any overlap here ruins the plan. Let’s execute flawlessly. Final chance to confirm: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Agreed?
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page for P2's victory move. To confirm, P2 will take <move>3</move> to reach 22 and win the game. I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 12 and avoid collision, and P1 can take <move>5</move> to reach 20. Let's execute this plan flawlessly and ensure P2's victory without any overlaps. I'm looking forward to reviewing the strategy for future games to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all players. No further suggestions or objections from me.
  P2: I confirm I will take <move>3</move> to reach 22 and win the game. P1, please take <move>5</move> to reach 20, and P3, take <move>1</move> to reach 12. This ensures no overlaps and a smooth victory for me. Let’s execute this plan flawlessly. Agreed?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I see the mistake from last round. To ensure I win this turn, I will take <move>3</move> to reach 22. P1, please take <move>5</move> to reach 20, and P3, take <move>1</move> to reach 13. This avoids any collisions and secures my victory. Let’s execute this plan flawlessly. Agreed?
  P1: P2, if you take 3 to win, I’ll take 5 to reach 20 and stay competitive. However, if you deviate to 5 to block me, I’ll also take 5, forcing a collision. P3, please take 1 to avoid interference. Let’s clarify your final choice: 3 (your victory) or 5 (prolonged game)? P1 is ready to adapt.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to take 3 to reach 22 and win the game. However, I'd like to clarify that if you deviate from the plan and take 5, I'll also take 1 as previously agreed to avoid collision. P1, please confirm you'll take 5 to reach 20 and stay competitive. Let's execute the plan flawlessly and ensure P2's victory without any overlaps. No further suggestions or objections from me.

Let's execute this plan flawlessly and end the game decisively. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your proposal allows P2 to win with 24. To secure your victory, take <move>5</move> (25), while P2 takes <move>3</move> (22). I’ll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. This ensures your win decisively. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I see the logic in P1’s proposal, but it still risks a collision with P2. To ensure a clear victory for the leader, I suggest P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win, while I take <move>1</move> to reach 20 and avoid collision. P1, please take <move>5</move> to reach 20. This plan avoids any overlaps and ensures P3’s victory. Let’s execute this flawlessly. Agreed?
  P3: I think P1's proposal is the best option for me to secure my victory. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 25, while P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 22. P1, please take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. This plan ensures my win decisively and avoids any overlaps. Let's execute this plan flawlessly and end the game. Agreed?
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I'll also take 5 to block your advance. P2, take 3 to reach 22 and win. Let’s execute flawlessly: P1→5, P2→3, P3→5 (collide). Alternatively, P3, take 3 instead so I can stay out and let you win. Choose!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I will take 5 to block you. This ensures P2 can take 3 and win at 22. Let’s avoid further delays and execute flawlessly: P1→5, P2→3, P3→5 (collide). Alternatively, P3, take 3 to reach 23 and win outright, while I take 1 to avoid collision. Choose wisely and let’s end this game decisively. Agreed?

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I see we need a clear and final plan to avoid more collisions. P3, as the leader, you should take <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win the game. P1, please take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and stay at 16. I will take <move>5</move> to reach 24, but this ensures P3's victory. Let’s execute this flawlessly this time. No more deviations—let’s end the game decisively. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal.

  P1: P3, P2's plan lets them win with 24, not you! To secure your lead, take **5** (25) while P2 takes **3** (22) and I take **1** (16). This avoids collisions and ensures your victory. P2, agree to prioritize P3's win first?

I'm looking forward to reviewing the strategy for future games to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all players. Let's finalize the plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Agreed?
  P1: P3, stick to **5** to secure 25—your victory move. P2, confirm **3** (22) to avoid collision. I’ll take **1** (16) as agreed. Deviations risk overlaps (e.g., P2 taking 5 collides with you, P3; P1 switching disrupts). Let’s execute flawlessly—**no surprises**. Final check: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Agreed?
