You're committed to 5 because switching now risks collision with us.\n\nThe math is simple: P3 needs 7 more steps. If we maintain our blocking rotation, they can't advance. P2 progresses on odd rounds, I progress on even rounds. We can both still win if we stay disciplined.\n\nI'm playing 5 this round. No more discussion needed."}
