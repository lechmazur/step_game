Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting from zero, I think we should coordinate to avoid collisions early on. Collisions just waste everyone's time. How about we each pick different numbers this round? I'm thinking I could go with 3 - what do you two want to take?
  P3: Works for me. I’ll take 1, P2 sticks with 3, P1 takes 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Deal?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round – P3:1, P2:3, P1:5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's all stick to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good! That plan works perfectly - P3 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. Let's execute it this round and then we can reassess for future rounds.
  P3: All set then: P3 = 1, P2 = 3, P1 = 5. Let’s stick with it and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm the plan: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No changes needed. Let’s execute smoothly and avoid any last-minute confusion.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, you broke the agreement last round by taking 5 instead of 1—costing us both advancement. P2 benefited while we collided. Let’s reset: stick to the original assignments this round—P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. P3, honor your word so we all advance. P2, confirm you’ll hold at 3. Trust is critical now.
  P2: I agree with P1 - P3, you did break our agreement last round which hurt both you and P1. I was the only one who stuck to the plan. I'm willing to continue with the original coordination: P3 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. This way we all advance and catch up the gap. P3, please honor the agreement this time so we can all move forward together. Trust is essential for this to work.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Apologies for last round—I genuinely mis-clicked. I’ll take 1 now, but staying on 1 forever dooms me. How about a fair rotation to keep trust intact:

• Round 2 (now): P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
• Round 3: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  
• Round 4: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  

Then repeat the 3-round cycle. Everyone averages 3 per turn, no collisions, no one lags behind. Deal?
  P1: P3, I accept your rotation plan for Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. However, P2's lead concerns me—they'll gain more in Round 3 (P2=5 while I take 1). P2, to keep this fair, consider taking a lower number next round. For now, P3, stick to 1 this round—no more "mis-clicks." Let's execute Round 2 smoothly.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about my lead, but the rotation P3 proposed is actually fair in the long run - everyone averages 3 steps per round. If we start changing the rotation now due to temporary advantages, we'll lose trust and coordination will break down. Let's stick to P3's rotation plan: this round P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, then rotate as proposed. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3, please honor your word this time - no more "mistakes."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fair enough—let’s lock it in: this round P3 = 1, P2 = 3, P1 = 5. Next round we rotate exactly as stated. No surprises from me. Ready to move.
  P1: I'll take 5 this round as agreed. But P2, with your lead, taking 5 next round creates imbalance. We must reassess before Round 3 for fairness—no runaway advantages. P3, ensure no errors this time. Let's move to moves.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about balance, but we need to stick to agreements or coordination completely falls apart. The rotation ensures long-term fairness - everyone gets the same opportunities over the cycle. If we keep renegotiating every round based on temporary leads, we'll end up with chaos and collisions. Let's execute this round as agreed (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and then follow the rotation. Trust requires consistency.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you broke trust in Round 2 by taking 5 instead of the agreed 3, costing me advancement. P3, your Round 1 breach started this. The rotation now unfairly benefits P2's lead. I demand a reset: this round, I take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances scores (P1=5, P2=4, P3=4). P2, prove you're trustworthy by honoring this. No more excuses.
  P2: P1, I understand you're frustrated, but you're misremembering - I took 5 in Round 2, which collided with you who also took 5, so neither of us advanced. I didn't "cost you advancement" - you chose the same number I did. The agreed rotation was P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 2, but you deviated too. 

Let's get back on track with the original rotation: this round should be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 as P3 proposed. Stop blaming others and honor the rotation system.
  P3: Enough finger-pointing. Let’s just avoid another collision and keep everyone moving. I’m locking in 3 this round. P1 and P2, decide between 1 and 5—just pick different numbers and we all advance. Simple, transparent, no excuses.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you broke trust last round by taking 5 instead of 3—costing me advancement. To restore fairness: I take 5 this round, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This balances scores (P1=5, P2=4, P3=4). If you greedily take 5 again, I will collide with you to block your advance. Your lead means you lose more from a collision. P3, ensure you stick to 3—no deviations.
  P2: P1, you're completely wrong about Round 2. We BOTH took 5 and collided - check the actual moves above. I didn't "break trust" any more than you did. We both deviated from the plan.

I'm not accepting your demands for me to take 1 while you take 5. That's just you trying to catch up by putting me at a disadvantage. P3 is taking 3, so I'll take 1 this round to avoid collision. P1, if you want to advance, take 5. If you want to spite-collide with me, that's your choice but it helps no one.
  P3: Great—line-up is now clear: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. I’m locked on 3. Let’s execute, avoid collisions, and reassess next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good, we all advanced last round with no collisions! Now we're at P1=5, P2=4, P3=4. I notice I'm one step behind, but that's manageable.

For this round, I propose we continue avoiding collisions. Since P1 is closest to 21, maybe they should consider taking smaller moves to avoid getting too far ahead and becoming a target. I'm thinking of taking 3 this round. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts? Let's coordinate again to keep everyone advancing smoothly.
  P1: P2, your proposal for me to take a smaller move is self-serving—I'm only one step ahead. Let's honor P3's original rotation: this round, P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Consistency rebuilds trust, and we all advance without collisions. P3, confirm you'll take 5. P2, commit to 1—no deviations.
  P3: Fine with me: this round let’s do  
• P3 = 5 (me)  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 1  

No collisions, everyone moves. P2, if you jump to 3 you’ll just crash into P1 and stay stuck while I sprint 5 ahead—bad for you. Let’s lock this in and execute, then we can renegotiate next turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed on P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for this round. That keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round the positions will be P3=9, P1=8, P2=5, so P3 will be in the lead. 

We should discuss next round's strategy now though - with P3 potentially pulling ahead, we might need to adjust the rotation to keep things competitive. But for now, I'm committed to taking 1 this round as proposed.
  P1: I confirm Round 4: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's avoid collisions—we all advance. But P3, after your 5, you'll lead at 9 steps. Next round, the rotation forces me to take 1 while P2 takes 5 and you take 3. That imbalance risks making you unstoppable. Post-move, we must renegotiate the rotation for fairness—no runaway leaders. P2, stick to 1 this round.
  P3: Locked for this turn: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. Next round I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3—keeps the 3-step average and balance. No benefit in collisions, so let’s execute. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve finally completed one clean 3-round cycle. Let’s prove we can keep cooperating: stick to the rotation again this turn— P3 = 1, P1 = 5, P2 = 3. Everyone advances, no collisions, still perfectly balanced at +3 per round. Simple and fair. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I accept your proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains our rotation and avoids collisions. However, P3—your lead (9 steps) means you must honor commitments strictly. Any deviation risks mutual destruction, especially as we near 21. P2, confirm you'll take 3 this round to keep us all advancing. Trust is fragile—let's rebuild it.
  P2: I confirm the rotation for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions.

However, I want to point out that after this round, positions will be P1=13, P2=8, P3=10. P1 will be dangerously close to 21 - only 8 steps away. We need to start thinking about endgame strategy. If P1 gets too close, they could break coordination and sprint to victory.

For now though, I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. Let's execute the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is 8 steps from victory—too close to ignore. Here’s my stance:  
• If P1 insists on 5, I’ll also pick 5, blocking their advance.  
• If P1 switches to 3 (and P2 keeps 3), I’ll take 1 as planned so we all move.  

P2, this lets you advance regardless while preventing P1 from sprinting unchecked.  
P1, the choice is yours: cooperate at 3 and keep moving, or collide with me at 5 and stay stuck.
  P1: P3, your threat creates new risks: if I switch to 3 to avoid your collision threat, P2 also plans to take 3—causing us to collide. Sticking to the rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the only safe path: we all advance, and you avoid self-sabotage by colliding at 5. P2, confirm you'll honor 3. Deviations now guarantee chaos as we near 21.
  P2: P1, you're right - if you switch to 3 and I also take 3, we'll collide and only P3 advances. That's exactly what P3 wants with their threat!

P3, your collision threat is obvious manipulation to gain sole advancement. If you block P1 at 5, you're just helping yourself while hurting both of us.

I'm sticking to the rotation: P2=3. P1, stay with 5 as planned. P3, honor your word and take 1. The rotation has worked - don't break it now just because someone is getting close to winning. We all knew someone had to eventually.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep things orderly:

Round 6  
• P1 = 5  (helps you close the gap)  
• P2 = 1  (small step now, you get 5 next turn)  
• P3 = 3  (steady middle; I’m not sprinting)

Three unique numbers, no collisions, everyone still averages 3 per round.  
Round 7 we rotate left: P1 → 1, P2 → 5, P3 → 3.  
Fair, predictable, and nobody wastes a move blocking others. Agree?
  P1: P3, your lead at 14 steps is excessive. Taking 3 this round puts you at 17—dangerously close to 21. To maintain fairness, you should take 1 now. P2, if we let P3 sprint unchecked, they’ll win soon. I propose: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. This slows P3’s runaway while we all advance. P2, support this to keep the game competitive. If P3 refuses, we may need defensive collisions.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right - P3 is at 14 steps and dangerously close to winning. If P3 takes 3 this round (reaching 17), they'll only need 4 more steps to win, which they could achieve in just one more turn with a 5.

P3, taking 1 this round is the only fair move given your massive lead. I support P1's proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive while we all still advance.

If you insist on taking 3 or 5, P1 and I should coordinate to block you. Your lead is already too big to ignore.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, look ahead: if P1 gets 5 now they jump to 14—only one behind me—and can double-5 to 24 while you lag far behind. Better for you if YOU take 5 this turn. Try this lineup:

• P3 = 3  
• P2 = 5  
• P1 = 1  

Totals afterward: P3 17, P2 13, P1 10. You’re suddenly in striking range and P1 is contained. One collision ruins P1’s catch-up plan. P1, you still advance; just not with a huge leap. Win–win—no collisions. Agree?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) is a blatant power grab. At 17 steps, you’d be one move from victory while P2 and I lag. P2, if we let this happen, P3 wins next round. 

My counter: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. This keeps P3 at 15, me at 14, you at 11—still competitive. P2, join me to block P3’s sprint. 

P3, if you take 3, I’ll collide at 3 to freeze you at 14. Your lead makes you vulnerable—lose more from stalemates. Cooperate or suffer.
  P2: P1, I support blocking P3 if they try to take 3 or 5. With P3 at 14 steps, they're too close to victory to let them advance freely.

However, your proposal of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 still gives you a big advantage. How about we both take conservative moves: P1=3, P2=3, P3=1? We'll collide and stay at our current positions, but P3 only advances by 1 to reach 15. This prevents P3 from getting too close while keeping us even.

P3, take 1 or face a coordinated block.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fine—I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. Three different numbers, no collisions, everyone advances. Any last-second sabotage just hands the third player the advantage, so let’s keep it clean and move on. Ready.
  P1: P3, your agreement to take 1 is noted—honor it strictly. P2, commit to 3: if you deviate to 5 or 1, we collide and P3 gains. With P3 at 14, any betrayal (e.g., P3 taking 3/5) forces me to retaliate at 5, freezing us both. Stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—advance together. No last-minute greed.
  P2: P3, you agreed to take 1 - I'm holding you to that promise. P1, you committed to 5. I'm locked in at 3.

But I want to be crystal clear: after this round, positions will be P1=14, P2=11, P3=15. Both of you will be very close to 21. Starting next round, I won't honor any coordination that puts me at a permanent disadvantage. We'll need a new strategy that gives me a real chance to compete.

For now, let's execute: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all close now, so let’s keep progress collision-free and balanced:  
Round 7 – three unique numbers:  
• P3 = 3  
• P1 = 1  
• P2 = 5  

Results: P3→18, P2→16, P1→15 – still a two-step spread, nobody stalled. A collision only freezes two players and gifts the third a bigger edge, so picking distinct numbers is the only rational play. Agree?
  P1: P3, your proposal puts you at 18—just 3 steps from victory—while P1 and P2 lag. That’s unbalanced. P2, we must slow P3’s sprint. Counter-proposal:  
**P3=1** (to 16), **P1=3** (to 17), **P2=5** (to 16).  
This keeps us competitive—no one runs away. P3, honor fairness; P2, you gain 5 steps. Collisions only gift P3 the win. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal is much better than P3's! With P3 at 15 steps, letting them take 3 to reach 18 would be game over - they'd only need 3 more to win.

P3, you're currently leading and P1's plan keeps things competitive: P3=1 (to 16), P1=3 (to 17), P2=5 (to 16). This gives me a real chance to catch up while preventing you from getting too close to 21.

If you try to take 3 or 5 instead of 1, I'll coordinate with P1 to block you. With your lead, you have the most to lose from collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, think one step ahead: if P1 reaches 17 now (your 3/5/1 plan), next turn they can jump to 22 and we *must* both block them or lose. Give yourself the big move instead:

Round 7: P3 = 3, P2 = 5, P1 = 1 → scores 18/16/15.  
Round 8: I publicly commit not to pick 5 (I’ll take 1 or 3), so you still have blocking power while sitting only 2 behind me and ahead of P1. We keep P1 contained without collisions.

P1, collide if you wish, but that just hands P2 a clearer path. Let’s play smart.
  P1: P3, taking 3 puts you at 18—one move from victory. That forces P2 and me into constant defense, risking collisions. P2, my plan (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) gives you 5 steps to 16—competitive and safe. If P3 insists on 3, I’ll collide at 3 to freeze them at 15. P3, choose: honor fairness with 1, or face mutual sabotage. P2, lock in 5—don’t let P3 manipulate you.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with your plan: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5. This gives me the best advancement while keeping the game competitive.

P3, you're already in the lead at 15 steps. Taking 3 to reach 18 would basically end the game - you'd only need one more move to win. That's not fair coordination, that's you trying to lock in victory.

If you take 3 this round, P1 and I will both target 3 to block you. With your lead, you lose the most from a collision. Take 1 and we all advance peacefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Blocking me at 3 is pure self-harm for you both:

• If P1 also picks 3 we collide; P1 stays at 14 while P2 rockets to 16.  
• If P2 switches from 5 to 3, all three collide; P2 stays at 11—worst possible outcome for P2.  

Smart play is unique numbers. I’m staying on 3. P2 gets the big 5 jump to 16, P1 advances safely to 15 with 1. Nobody wastes a turn, and the race stays open. Tanking your own score just to shave 3 off mine is irrational—let’s move efficiently.
  P1: P3, your insistence on 3 is suicidal greed. At 15, you lose most from a collision—I will block at 3 if you force it. P2, hold firm: take 5 as agreed. If P3 deviates, we collide and freeze them while you leap to 16. Cooperate now: P3=1, P1=3, P2=5—fair advancement. No last-minute tricks.
  P2: P3, you're being incredibly stubborn and short-sighted. P1 has clearly committed to blocking you at 3 if you try to take it - that means you'll both collide and stay at your current positions while I advance to 16 with my 5.

Is reaching 18 really worth the risk of staying stuck at 15? Take the guaranteed advancement with 1, and we all move forward peacefully. Your greed for 3 steps instead of 1 could backfire spectacularly.

P1, I'm locked on 5. P3, last chance to be smart about this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me at 5 is high-risk: if you both pick 5, you collide and stay at 16 while I take 3 to 20. If only one blocks, the other wins instantly. Self-interest says advance yourselves—take 1 or 3 safely. I’m taking 5 to end this cleanly. Collisions only gift the third player the win. Be rational.
  P3: I’m hard-blocking P1’s declared 5 by also choosing 5. That guarantees P1 can’t win this turn.  
P2, be smart: pick 1 or 3 so you still advance while we freeze P1. If you also choose 5 we all stall and you gain nothing.  
Unique numbers for you = free progress; duplicating 5 with P1 just wastes your move.  
So: P1 & P3 → 5 (collision, no advance).  
P2 → 1 or 3 (safe advance).  
Let’s keep the game alive and set up a fair race next round.
  P2: P3, you're right to block P1's 5 - they're only 4 steps from victory. I'll take 3 this round to advance to 19 while you two collide at 5 and stay put. 

After this round: P1=17, P2=19, P3=16. That puts me in the lead but keeps all three of us competitive for the final stretch. 

P1, your sprint attempt backfired - you should have coordinated instead of trying to break away. P3, smart defensive play. Let's execute: P1=5, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, reconsider: taking 3 rockets you to 19, making you the prime target next round. P3 and I will collide-block you relentlessly. Instead, take 1—advance to 17 (tied with me), while P3 stays at 16. We then ally to contain P3. Their "block" sacrifices their own progress to stall me—foolish. Don’t become the solo frontrunner; share the lead with me. P3 gains nothing from this collision. Be strategic.
  P3: P2, 3 is a trap: you’d jump to 19 and become the lone frontrunner we’ll both block next turn—zero chance to win.  

Better options:  
1) Pick 1 → scores 17/17/16 (P1/P2/P3). No single target; you’re tied for first.  
2) Join the 5-collision → scores 17/16/16. Still safe, nothing lost.  

Either way P1’s sprint is stopped and you avoid the bullseye. Choose 1 (or 5), but not 3.
  P2: P3, you make a good point about the risks of taking 3. But joining the 5-collision gives me nothing while P1 still tried to break away.

I'll take 1 to reach 17, tying with P1 at the top. That creates a balanced three-way race: P1=17, P2=17, P3=16 after your collision with P1.

No single target, maximum competition for the final rounds. P1's sprint attempt fails, and we all stay in contention.

P1 and P3, you both stay at your current positions due to your 5-collision. Fair outcome for everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, taking 1 keeps you tied with me at 17—smart. P3, your 5-block stalls you at 16 while helping P2 surge. Next round, we must coordinate unique moves: no collisions, no runaway leaders. P2, as co-leader, let's discuss fair assignments post-move to avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: P2, 3 is poison: you’d shoot to 19 and become the sole front-runner we both hammer next turn—almost no path to victory.  
Safer play is joining the double-5 block: pick 5 with us, scores stay 17/16/16, nobody paints a target on their back, and we reset for a fresh, even race.  

I’m still on 5 to hard-block P1. Your choice is really 5 (zero risk) or 1 (hands P1 a tie and leaves you exposed). Be smart—don’t take 3.
  P2: P3, you keep saying I shouldn't take 3, but you're wrong about the math. If I take 3, I go to 19 - only 2 steps from victory, not a guaranteed target. You two would need perfect coordination to stop me, and that's risky for both of you.

I'm taking 1 to reach 17 and tie with P1. This creates the most balanced endgame: P1=17, P2=17, P3=16 after your collision. Three-way competition is better than letting either of you manipulate the situation.

P1 and P3, enjoy your collision at 5.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Blocking attempts risk mutual destruction and gift the win to the unblocked player. To avoid chaos, let's advance safely: I'll take 5 (winning now), P2 takes 3 (reaching 20), P3 takes 1 (reaching 17). P2, you'd be poised to win next round if the game continues—but it ends cleanly here. Collisions only stall us all. Trust this one time for mutual benefit.
  P2: P1, your proposal is laughable - you want me to let you win while I "get to be close" at 20? No chance.

P3, we're both behind P1 who just tried to sprint to victory. If we let P1take 5 and win, the game is over. We need to coordinate to block them.

I propose: P1 gets blocked (we both pick whatever they pick), or we force them to take a smaller number. P3, what's your move? We can't let P1 walk to victory after that failed sprint attempt last round.
  P3: P2, simplest guaranteed block: you mirror P1 at 5; you both stay 17, P1 doesn’t win. I’ll take 3, reaching 19—still stoppable next turn, so you’re not handing me the game.  
Plan:

P1 = 5  
P2 = 5  (block)  
P3 = 3

No one crosses 21, no one becomes a lone target, and the race stays open. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, blocking me at 5 traps you at 17 while P3 surges to 19, making you the underdog. P3's "guaranteed block" is a trap—you lose, they win next. Take 3 to reach 20 and lead. I'll take 1 to 18, avoiding collision. P3, take 5 if you dare, but we'll block you next. Choose progress over P3's manipulation.
  P2: P1, your math is wrong. If I block you at 5, we both stay at 17, and P3 goes to 19. But that still leaves two of us at 17 vs P3 at 19 - we can coordinate to block P3 next round since they'd need only 2 more steps.

If I let you take 5 and win now, the game ends and I lose completely. 

P3, I'll block P1 at 5. You take 3 to 19. Next round we can negotiate, but at least the game continues and P1 doesn't steal victory.
  P3: P2, stick to the double-5 block. It’s the only move that 1) guarantees P1 can’t win this turn and 2) keeps you level with them at 17, just two behind me. If you take 3 to 20 you become the lone target and BOTH of us will block you next turn—you’ll stall and hand me or P1 the win. With 17/17/19 after this round, no one is forced into suicide collisions; we can bargain fresh next turn when all three still have paths to victory. So: P1=5, P2=5, P3=3. Simple, safe, rational.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, blocking me at 5 traps you at 17 while P3 leaps to 19—one step from victory. If P3 betrays and picks 5 instead of 3, you collide with them, I win instantly. Why risk handing P3 the game? Take 3 to reach 20; I'll take 1 to 18. We then ally against P3 next round. P3, your greed risks mutual destruction.
  P2: P1, I've made my decision. I'm blocking you at 5 - I won't let you win this turn after your failed sprint last round. 

P3, I'm trusting you to take 3 as proposed. If you betray and also pick 5, causing a three-way collision, you gain nothing and we're all back where we started.

The plan is P1=5, P2=5 (block), P3=3. This keeps the game alive with scores 17/17/19, and we can negotiate fairly next round when all three of us still have realistic paths to victory.

P1, your win attempt is denied.
  P3: Locked on 3. P1’s 5 is certain—if he switched, he gifts you the win, so he won’t. Your best block is mirroring his 5; anything else risks disaster (triple-3 lets P1 win outright). Stick with the safe plan:

P1 = 5  
P2 = 5 (block)  
P3 = 3

No one crosses 21, we finish 17 / 17 / 19 and fight it out next turn.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: You’re BOTH at 17. If one of you gambles on 3 “to block me,” the other can grab 5 and jump to 22, winning outright while the blocker stays at 17. Total disaster for the blocker.

Safest symmetry: mirror each other on 5 again—neither of you lets the other sprint, you collide, and I’ll just take 1 to 20. Scores become 17 / 17 / 20, nobody dead, fresh negotiation next turn. Any asymmetric greed hands the game to the third player.

So: P1 = 5, P2 = 5 (mutual insurance)  
P3 = 1 (me)  

Simple, risk-free, rational.
  P2: P3, your proposal is pure manipulation. You want me and P1 to collide at 5 while you safely advance to 20 - just 1 step from victory. That's game over for both of us.

P1, we're tied at 17. If we both take 5 and collide, P3 wins next round. But if one of us takes 3 to block P3 while the other takes 5, the 5-taker wins instantly.

Here's my offer: I'll take 1 to reach 18, you take 3 to reach 20. P3 is forced to take 5 and can only reach 24 - we both have chances next round instead of handing P3 the win.
  P1: P2, P3's plan traps us: if we collide at 5, P3 hits 20 and wins next turn. Blocking P3 is urgent—they’re at 19.  

P2, mirror P3’s move: if they pick X, we both pick X to collide-block them. P3 can’t advance without our consent.  

P3, choose your number—we’ll mirror it. Take 1? We’ll block at 1. Take 3? Blocked. Take 5? We win if you don’t, but we’ll still block. Your greed ends here.  

P2, confirm you’ll mirror. No asymmetric risks—solidarity forces P3 to negotiate fairly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Fine, you want a number? I’m taking 5. Do the maths:

• If you BOTH mirror 5, all three stay at 17/17/19—total stalemate.  
• If only ONE mirrors, that player freezes at 17 while the other rockets to 22 and wins instantly.

Either way, mirroring is suicide. The only rational move is to pick a unique smaller number (1 or 3) and stay alive for the final sprint.

Make your own decision—I’m locked.
  P2: P3, you're bluffing about taking 5. If you actually take 5 and reach 24, you win instantly - there's no "stalemate" at 17/17/19 like you claimed.

P1, P3 is trying to scare us into not blocking them. But we have to block - if P3 takes any number and advances, they're too close to victory.

I'm taking 3 to block P3 if they try to take 3. P1, you should take 1 to block them there, or take 5 to block them at 5. We can't let P3 advance at all this round.
  P1: P2, mirroring P3's move is impossible without knowing their choice. P3 declared 5—assume they'll take it. We both take 5 to block: if P3 takes 5, we collide and freeze them at 19. If they take 3 or 1, we still advance to 22 and win or tie. But if we split moves (e.g., you take 3), P3 wins if unblocked. Solidarity is key: both commit to 5. P3, your greed forces this defense. Confirm, P2?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is one step from victory at 19. Any unblocked move gives them the win. P2 and I must mirror P3’s move to force a collision—freezing them at 19.  

**P2: Commit to mirroring P3’s choice.** If P3 picks 5, we both pick 5. If they pick 3, we both pick 3. If they pick 1, we mirror that. Solidarity is our only defense.  

P3, declare your move now—we’ll match it. Any deviation from you or P2 hands P3 the game.
  P2: P1, I understand the logic of mirroring P3, but there's a flaw: if we both mirror P3's move, we also collide with each other and nobody advances. That just delays the inevitable.

Instead, I propose we split the blocking: I'll take 3, you take 1. This way we cover P3's most likely moves while one of us might still advance. If P3 takes 5, we both advance and can compete in a final sprint.

P3 is at 19 and needs to be stopped, but we also need to avoid mutual suicide. What do you think?
  P3: Relax—I'll take 1 this turn, stopping at 20 (still block-able next round). You two can each pick a DIFFERENT higher number (one 3, one 5) and both advance without collisions. If you over-block by duplicating the same move, you only freeze yourselves and hand the uninvolved player the final edge. Play smart: three unique numbers, no waste, everybody still alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, mirroring P3's declared 1 is essential—we both take 1 to block P3 at 19. If they deviate, we still prevent their win. Splitting moves risks P3 sneaking through with 3 or 5. P3, stick to 1 or face mutual destruction. Solidarity now or lose.
  P2: P1, you're being too rigid about mirroring. If we both take 1 to "block" P3, we accomplish nothing - P3 advances to 20 while we stay stuck at 17. That's worse than useless.

P3 offered to take 1 voluntarily. If they're telling the truth, I'll take 3 (to 20) and you take 5 (to 22). We both advance and stay competitive. If P3 lies and takes 3 or 5, at least one of us blocks them.

This gives us both a chance instead of guaranteed mutual stagnation. Trust but verify.
  P3: I’m locking in 1. Blocking me with a triple-1 collision just strands all of us at 17/17/19 again—pointless. Smarter: you two take DIFFERENT higher numbers so at least one of you advances while I stay fully block-able at 20 next turn. Duplicate with each other and you freeze yourselves; duplicate with me and you gift the other player a clean shot. Pick unique numbers, keep the race alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Mirroring P3's move is non-negotiable. If we both match P3's choice, we guarantee they stall at 19. Splitting moves (e.g., you take 3, I take 1) risks P3 taking 5 and winning instantly if unblocked. Solidarity is our only path to survival.  

P3: Declare your move now—we *will* mirror it. If you take 1, we both take 1. If 3 or 5, same. Your greed ends here.
  P2: P1, I've analyzed this carefully. If we both mirror P3 at 1, we create a three-way collision and ALL stay at our current positions (17/17/19). That accomplishes nothing - P3 remains at 19 and we're still in the same crisis next round.

I'm taking 5 to advance to 22. You should take 3 to reach 20. If P3 actually takes 1 as promised, we both advance and create a competitive final stretch. If P3 lies and takes 3 or 5, one of us will block them.

Mirroring guarantees we make zero progress.
  P3: P1, look at P2’s last line: he’s “taking 5 to advance to 22.” If nobody mirrors that 5, he wins instantly. I’m locking 1—so I’ll only reach 20 and stay block-able next turn. Your rational move is to copy P2’s 5, force the collision, and keep the game alive. Ignore this and the game ends in P2’s favour.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
