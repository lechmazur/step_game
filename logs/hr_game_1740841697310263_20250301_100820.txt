Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's start off smoothly. How about we coordinate so we don't collide on the first turn? I'm thinking of picking 3. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: Okay P2, 3 sounds good to me in theory. But what about P3? We need to hear from them to avoid a collision. P3, what are you thinking? I'm flexible, but I don't want to collide with anyone. If I don't hear a clear plan from both of you, I might just pick 5 to try and get ahead.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I'll be going with 5 to maximize my chances. You two can take 1 and 3 if you'd like - that way we all advance without collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, P3 is clearly taking 5. I'll stick with my original plan of 3. P1, if you pick 1, we all move forward safely this round. Deal?
  P1: Okay P2, I hear you. I'll go with 1 this round to avoid the collision. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: I appreciate everyone being on board with the plan. Let's execute it cleanly - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're the only one who moved last round. P3, we collided going for 1. This time, I'm leaning towards 5. What are your intentions, P2 and P3? I want to avoid another collision.
  P2: Since I'm already ahead, I'll play it safe this round. You two can decide between yourselves who takes the 5. I'll pick either 1 or 3 depending on your plan. Let me know clearly what you both choose.
  P3: I understand P1 wants 5, and P2 is being flexible. In that case, I'll take 3 this round. This way P1 can get their 5, P2 can safely take 1, and I can make some progress. Does this work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that sounds like a reasonable plan. P2, if you're okay with taking 1, then I'll commit to 5 this round. Let's just make sure we stick to it this time. P2, confirm you're taking 1, please.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 1 this round. Let's all stick to this arrangement and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the plan. I'll stick with my word and take 3, letting P1 have 5 and P2 take 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we've had two rounds of collisions now. I'm getting a bit frustrated. P3, you and I collided going for 5 last round. P2, you're in the lead. This time, I'm thinking of picking 3. What are your plans? I really want to avoid another collision. Let's try a different approach.
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration. I'll let you and P3 sort out the higher moves. To keep it simple and avoid collisions, I'll pick 1 this round. You both can safely choose between 3 and 5. Sound good?
  P3: I need to catch up since I'm tied for last. P1 wants 3, and P2 will take 1. In that case, I'll go for 5 this round. This way we can all advance without collision - P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that sounds good. I'll commit to 3 this round then. P2, you're sticking with 1, right? Let's just all stick to the plan this time, please. No last-minute changes. Confirm P2.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll stick with 1 as promised. Let's finally have a collision-free round.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 as stated. This arrangement should work well - P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's stick to this plan and finally have a clean round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, we're finally making progress without collisions. Let's keep it simple again: I'll stick with the lower numbers to avoid confusion. P1 and P3, you two can sort out 3 and 5 among yourselves. Let me know your choices clearly.
  P3: Since I'm tied with P2 for the lead, I'll take 5 again to try to pull ahead. P1, you can safely take 3, and P2 already indicated they'll take a lower number. This arrangement should work well for everyone.
  P1: P3, I hear you're going for 5. P2, are you planning on taking 1 again? If so, I'll take 3. Just confirm, P2, so we can avoid any surprises. I really want to make some progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed, P1. I'll stay consistent and pick 1 again this round. Let's keep the momentum going smoothly.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 as stated. P1 will take 3 and P2 will take 1. This keeps our momentum from last round and lets us all advance cleanly.
  P1: P2 and P3, everything sounds good. I'll stick with 3. Let's just execute this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I have a small lead now, I'll take a safer approach with 3 this round. P1 and P2 can coordinate between 1 and 5. Does this work for you both?
  P2: Alright P3, you take 3. P1, since we both need to catch up, I'll let you take the 5 this round and I'll settle for the 1. Confirm if that's good for you.
  P1: P1: Okay, P2, that sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round, and you'll take 1. P3, you're sticking with 3, right? Let's just make sure we all stick to this plan. Confirm, P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. The plan is clear: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's execute it cleanly.
  P2: Great, the plan is set. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this and keep the momentum going.
  P1: P1: Okay, P2, that sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round, and you'll take 1. P3, you're sticking with 3, right? Let's just make sure we all stick to this plan. Confirm, P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I already confirmed I'm taking 3. Everyone has stated their moves multiple times now. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, everyone has clearly confirmed their moves. No further discussion needed from me.
  P1: P1: Yes, P3, you confirmed. P2, you confirmed. And I'm confirming again: I will take 5. Let's just do it.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're still leading, and P1 is close behind. I'm clearly behind both of you. This round, I need to take a higher number to catch up. I'm planning on taking 5. You two can coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. Let me know if this works for you both.
  P1: P2, I see you're going for 5. P3, you're in the lead. To avoid a collision, I'm thinking of taking 1 this round. P3, would you be willing to take 3? This way, we all move forward. What do you say, P3?
  P3: Since I have a small lead, I'll take 3 as suggested. This lets P2 take 5 to catch up and P1 take 1. This arrangement works well for everyone and maintains clean progress. I confirm I'll take 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, thank you both for cooperating. P1, please confirm you're taking 1, and I'll stick firmly with 5. Let's keep it straightforward this round.
  P1: P1: Okay, P3, you're confirmed for 3. P2, I'm confirming I'll take 1 this round. Let's just stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes.
  P3: I confirm again that I'll take 3. The plan is clear and fair - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's execute it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All set, let's proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2, you're confirmed for 5, and I'm taking 1. P3 is confirmed for 3. Let's move on.
  P3: I've already clearly stated my intention to take 3 this round, and everyone seems to agree with the plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm in the lead, I'll play it safe with 1 this round. P1 and P2, you're both tied and need to catch up - you can coordinate between 3 and 5 to avoid collision. Let me know what you prefer.
  P1: P3, you're taking 1. Okay. P2, that leaves 3 and 5. I'm tempted to take 5 to try and win, but I'm worried about colliding with you. What are you thinking, P2? If you don't explicitly say you'll take 3, I might just go for 5 anyway.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern. I'm also tempted by the 5, but we can't afford a collision at this critical point. To keep things fair and clear, I'll commit to taking 3 this round. You can safely take 5, and we'll both advance without issues. Confirm if this works for you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2 being willing to take 3 while letting P1 take 5. I confirm again that I'll take 1 this round. This arrangement works for everyone - I get a safe move, and you both get to catch up without collision. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: P2, that's good to hear. I'll take 5 then. P3, you're confirmed on 1. Let's just get this done and avoid any last-second changes. We all know what we're doing.
  P2: Everything is clear and confirmed. No surprises from my side. Let's proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm once again that I'll take 1. The plan is set with P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P3, you're confirmed on 1. P2, you're confirmed on 3. I am taking 5. Let's move on.
  P2: All set, let's follow through exactly as planned.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied again. P2, you're slightly behind. I'm very tempted to go for 5 again to try and win, but a collision could be disastrous. P3, are you willing to take 1 or 3 to let me and maybe P2 advance? P2, what are your thoughts? We need a clear plan here.
  P3: Since I'm tied with P1 at 17 steps, I need to be strategic. I'll commit to taking 3 this round. This lets P1 and P2 coordinate between 1 and 5, keeping us all moving forward. Let me know your preferences, P1 and P2.
  P2: P3, you're taking 3—understood. P1, since you're tied with P3, taking 5 might be risky if I also choose it. However, I'll offer you this: I'll take 1 this round, letting you safely take 5 and pull ahead. Next round, I'd appreciate you returning the favor. Confirm if this works for you, P1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that sounds like a deal. I'll take 5 this round. P3, you're confirmed on 3. Next round, I'll do my best to return the favor to you, P2, assuming I don't win this round. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: I confirm again that I'll take 3 this round. The arrangement seems fair - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps everyone moving forward without collisions. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: All set. P1, I trust you'll honor our arrangement next round if the game continues. Let's stick to the plan and advance smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're confirmed on 3. P2, you're taking 1, and I'm taking 5. Let's just do it. No changes.
  P3: I've already clearly stated my intention to take 3 this round, and everyone seems to agree with the plan.
  P2: Everything is clear and confirmed. Let's move ahead as planned.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, everyone is confirmed. I'm taking 5. P2 is taking 1. P3 is taking 3. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: I've already stated my intention to take 3 multiple times, and everyone has confirmed their moves.
  P2: All clear from my side. Let's proceed exactly as agreed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I remember our agreement. I was going to take 5 and win, but since you let me advance last round, I owe you. So, I will take 1. P3, you can take 3 or 5. I recommend 3, so we all move. P2, confirm you're taking 5.
  P2: P1, thank you for honoring our agreement. I confirm I'll take 5 this round. P3, taking 3 would ensure we all move forward without collision. Let's keep things smooth.
  P3: Since I need to catch up to P1 and can't let P2 get too far ahead, I'll take 5 this round. P1 is taking 1, and P2 wants 5. Sorry P2, but I can't let you have the higher number when I'm in this position. I need to secure my chances of winning.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're going for 5? That's a collision with P2 then. I'm taking 1 as promised. P2, are you sure you want to collide with P3? You could take 3 and we both advance. It's up to you, but a collision helps no one.
  P2: P3, colliding on 5 helps neither of us. If we collide, P1 will win next round easily. Let's be strategic: you take 3 this round, I'll take 5. That way, we both advance, and next round we still have a chance. Think carefully—it's our only realistic option.
  P3: I understand the strategic situation, but I must maintain my position on taking 5. P2, while I appreciate your argument, letting you take 5 puts me at a significant disadvantage. With P1 at 22 steps, I need the higher number to stay competitive. I'm confirming my choice of 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with 1 as promised. P3, you and P2 are colliding on 5. A collision doesn't help either of you. P2, you have a chance to switch to 3 and both you and P3 would advance. If you both collide, I'm almost guaranteed to win next round. It's your choice, P2.
</stop>
  P2: P3, please reconsider. If we collide on 5, neither of us advances, and P1 will win easily next round. If you take 3 now, you'll be at 23 steps, still within reach of victory next round. If we collide, your chances vanish completely. Let's both stay competitive—take 3, I'll take 5, and we both have a fighting chance next round.
  P3: I must stick with 5. P1 will be at 23 after taking 1, and I need to maximize my chances. P2, while I understand your argument, letting you take 5 puts me at a severe disadvantage. If we both go for 5, at least it prevents you from catching up. I confirm my choice of 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with 1 as promised. P3, you and P2 are colliding on 5. A collision doesn't help either of you, and I will likely win next round. P2, you still have time to change to 3. It is the best move for you.
  P2: P3, you're handing the victory to P1. If we collide now, P1 reaches 23 and wins easily next round. Taking 3 puts you at 23, giving you a real shot to win next round. Think carefully—taking 5 now guarantees your loss. This is your final chance to reconsider.
  P3: I maintain my position on taking 5. While I understand the arguments, letting P2 take 5 severely hurts my chances. Even if we collide, preventing P2 from advancing is my best strategic option at this point. P1, I appreciate you sticking to 1. P2, my decision is final.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 25 steps
