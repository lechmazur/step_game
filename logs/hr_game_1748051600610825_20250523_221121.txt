Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Idea for smooth progress: let’s rotate the three numbers so nobody collides.  

Round 1: P1 chooses 1, I (P2) choose 5, P3 chooses 3.  
Round 2: shift right → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5.  
Round 3: shift right again → P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.  

Then repeat the cycle. Each of us gets every number once per three rounds (total 9 steps), and we avoid blocking. Sound good?
  P1: P2's rotation plan sounds fair in theory, but I'm concerned about trusting it long-term. What happens when someone gets close to 22? Will we really stick to the rotation when winning is on the line? 

That said, I'm willing to try it for the first cycle to see if we can build trust. Let me confirm: Round 1 I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Then we rotate as described.

P3, what do you think about this plan?
  P3: I'm willing to try the rotation for now. It maintains fairness, but we all know winning is individual. If someone nears 22 and the chance opens up, I won’t hesitate to switch tactics. Let’s start with the agreed cycle and see how the early rounds go – but don't be surprised if I seize a chance later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fair enough. Let’s lock in the rotation for the first 3 rounds, then pause and reassess when we’re all around 9. If anyone deviates before then, the other two can gang-up with collision moves to punish the defector. Deal?
  P1: Agreed on the rotation plan for the first 3 rounds with the punishment mechanism. If anyone breaks the deal early, the other two should definitely coordinate to block them. 

One clarification though - when we "reassess around 9 steps," let's be transparent about our intentions. No sudden betrayals mid-cycle. If someone wants to change strategy, announce it during the conversation phase first.

Ready to start with me taking 1, P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3.
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation for now. Fairness early can set up a competitive race later. But I'll be closely watching everyone’s signals. If any unexpected moves arise, I’ll be ready to adjust my strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm staying with the rotation for Round 2, but I’m monitoring everyone closely. We all know early fairness sets the pace, yet winning is our only objective. I'll adjust if any unexpected signals come through. Let’s keep communication clear so we all know when to shift gears.
  P1: Good, everyone stuck to the rotation in Round 1. For Round 2, according to our plan, I should take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. 

I'm still committed to the rotation for this round, but P3 raises a good point about monitoring signals. Let's all stay alert for any signs someone might deviate.

After this round we'll be at P1:4, P2:6, P3:8. Still early enough that the rotation benefits everyone equally.
  P2: Sticking with the rotation this round—I’ll take 1. After the third move (when we’re all at 9), let’s pause the cycle and renegotiate so no one can sprint to 22 unopposed. Fair?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with the agreed rotation for now. However, I'll be watching closely for any stealth changes. If any player signals a shift in strategy, let's make it clear so we all respond appropriately.
  P1: Sounds like we're all aligned for Round 2. I'll take 3 as planned. 

Just want to emphasize - after Round 3 when we're all at 9 steps, we definitely need that reassessment conversation. At that point we'll be halfway to 22, so the endgame dynamics will start mattering more. Let's make sure we have a clear discussion then about how to handle the final stretch.
  P2: Confirming: I’m taking 1 this round as planned. Let’s finish the first cycle clean, hit 9-9-9, then openly brainstorm an endgame pattern that still discourages collisions but gives each of us a shot. See you after the moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still on board with the rotation for now, but as we approach 9 steps each, I’ll be watching for any unexpected shifts. Let’s ensure that any intended changes are clearly signaled before we break the cycle—no surprises. Quick deviations may trigger coordinated blocks, and we all want to avoid that. Ready to keep it fair until we reach 9 each.
  P1: Alright, we've confirmed the plan multiple times. Let's execute Round 2 cleanly - I'm taking 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Then we'll all be at 9 steps and can have that crucial reassessment discussion.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with the rotation for Round 3. However, being slightly ahead might affect later moves if we’re not careful. Let's all be extra clear about any intended changes before switching strategy near 9 steps. Transparency now will help us all avoid surprising collisions later.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this round (so P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) to finish the first cycle clean at 9-9-9. After that, let’s design a fresh pattern that avoids giving any one player a baked-in jump to 22—maybe no one takes 5 twice in a row or we sprinkle more 1-steps. Open to ideas; transparency keeps collisions as our only punishment tool.
  P1: Agreed on finishing the rotation - I'll take 5 this round to get us all to 9 steps. 

For the reassessment after this round, I propose we shift to a more dynamic approach. Maybe we announce our intended moves each round during conversation, which gives others a chance to coordinate or counter if someone tries to sprint. This keeps some cooperation while allowing strategic play.

The key is avoiding the scenario where someone can just take 5+5+3 in three consecutive rounds to win from 9 steps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm committed to the rotation through 9. As we near 9 each, I suggest we briefly signal our intended move ranges for the next rounds to avoid last-minute collisions. Let's keep it transparent so that if any of us plans to sprint, it's known.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m playing 3 this round. After we’re all tied at 9, let’s each publicly state our next TWO intended moves before committing. Anyone who lies risks the other two stacking collisions against them. That keeps options open but deters surprise sprints. We can hash out details in Round 4’s chat.
  P1: Perfect, let's finish this cycle cleanly. I'll take 5 as planned to get us all to 9 steps.

I like P2's idea about announcing our next TWO intended moves starting in Round 4. That gives us transparency while preventing sudden sprints to victory. If someone lies about their announced moves, the other two can definitely coordinate to block them.

This should give us a good balance between cooperation and competition as we enter the more critical phase of the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying committed to the rotation until Round 3 wraps up. I support locking in our next two moves publicly in Round 4 so we all know the plan. However, if I notice any hidden pivot or jump toward the finish, I’ll block it to maintain fairness. Let's stay clear and consistent.
  P2: Last call before we lock moves: I’m still on 3. After we hit 9, let’s each announce a two-move queue with no double-5 (you can use 5 once, 3 once, 1 once across two rounds). Example R4/R5: P1 1→3, P2 5→1, P3 3→5. Totals become 10/12/14—transparent yet nobody can sprint. We’ll revisit after those two. Open to tweaks, but clarity now avoids messy collisions later.
  P1: I agree with P2's refined proposal about announcing two-move queues with no double-5s. That's a smart constraint to prevent sprinting while maintaining some strategic flexibility.

Let me confirm one more time: I'm taking 5 this round to finish our rotation at 9-9-9. Then starting Round 4, we each announce our next two moves with the no-double-5 rule.

This gives us controlled competition without chaos. Ready to execute Round 3 and move into this new phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Concrete two-move queue (no double-5s, unique numbers each round):

Round 4  P1 → 1  P2 → 5  P3 → 3  
Round 5  P1 → 3  P2 → 1  P3 → 5  

That keeps collisions at zero and lands us 13 / 15 / 17. After Round 5 we pause and map the finish. If anyone strays, the other two should immediately copy that number next turn to freeze them in place. Fair?
  P3: I'm fine with P2's two-move queue and the no-double-5 rule. I'll stick to the sequence as planned and will stay alert for any deviations. Transparency is key—if anyone shifts gears unexpectedly, let's coordinate immediately to block them. I'm committed to fairness and a competitive finish.
  P1: I agree with P2's two-move queue proposal. It's a fair way to maintain transparency while preventing surprise sprints.

For clarity: Round 4 I take 1, Round 5 I take 3. This puts us at the projected 13/15/17 split after Round 5.

However, I want to point out that after Round 5, we'll be in a very delicate endgame situation. P3 will only need 5 more steps to win, while P2 needs 7 and I need 9. We'll need to be extremely careful about our coordination in the final rounds.

Sticking to the plan for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locked on 5 this round, 1 next. Proposal for the finish: starting Round 6, whoever is in 1st place may not announce 5 that turn—if they do, the other two simply mirror it to block. This deters a quick 17 → 22 jump while keeping paths open via 3/1 combos. Fair safeguard?
  P3: I confirm my moves remain as agreed—Round 4: 3, Round 5: 5. I support the Round 6 safeguard against a leader picking 5. I’ll be alert and ready to block any deviation.
  P1: Alright, I'm committed to the plan. Round 4 I'll take 1, Round 5 I'll take 3 as agreed.

P2's safeguard about the leader not being allowed to pick 5 starting Round 6 makes sense - it prevents quick wins while keeping the game competitive. 

Just want to confirm we're all truly committed to these announced moves for Rounds 4-5. Any deviation breaks trust and triggers immediate blocking from the other two players.

Ready to execute this fairly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Locking in the agreed queue: this round I take 1.  

For Round 6, let’s formalise the safeguard we floated: the current leader (very likely P3 at 17) must not pick 5. If they do, the other two of us will both slam 5 to zero-out the turn. That threat should keep the finish a real race instead of a one-turn jump.  

No other constraints for Round 6 yet—let’s talk after we see the board at 13 / 15 / 17.
  P3: I confirm my move: Round 5 I’ll take 5, as agreed. Let’s all stick firmly to our announcements. In Round 6, I’ll play cautiously and be ready to block any deviation. If anyone tries a hidden pivot, we all know the cost. Let’s honor the safeguard against a leader sprint and ensure our coordinated plan stays intact.
  P1: I'm taking 3 as agreed to reach 13 steps.

Looking ahead to Round 6, I notice we'll actually be at 13/15/17 as projected. The leader restriction makes sense, but I want to add: let's also agree that if anyone deviates from their announced move THIS round, the punishment starts immediately next round.

Also, after Round 6 we should discuss how to handle the final approach more carefully - P3 will be very close to winning and we need a fair but competitive endgame structure.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Still locked on 1 this round. For the Round 6 safeguard: whoever ends Round 5 with the sole lead must avoid 5—if they try, the other two both slam 5 to freeze them. If it’s a tie for first, 5 remains fair game. We’ll reevaluate once we see 13 / 15 / 17 (assuming no one deviates). Any stray move this turn triggers immediate blocking next round. Ready to execute?
  P3: I'm confirming my announced moves. For Round 6, I'll stick with a cautious approach under the safeguard. I urge that any leader in sole first strictly avoid 5, and if deviations occur, we block immediately. Assuming our totals reach 13/15/17, let's consider a clear move queue for the final stretch to prevent any sudden sprint. Staying committed and communicating openly is key.
  P1: I'm committed to taking 3 as announced. After this round we'll be at 13/15/17, making P2 the leader - so by our safeguard rule, P2 won't be able to pick 5 in Round 6.

I think we need to plan beyond just Round 6 though. With scores that close, we should consider announcing moves for Rounds 6-7 to prevent chaos in the final stretch. Otherwise someone might try a desperate sprint when we're all within striking distance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Round 6 proposal (honours “leader may not pick 5”):  
• P1 → 5 • P2 → 3 • P3 → 1  

That equalises us at 18-18-18, so no one can finish in one jump and trust stays intact. If anyone breaks it, the other two mirror that number next round to freeze them. Fair?
  P3: I support P2's Round 6 proposal. At our current scores (10, 14, 12), tying at 18 seems fair, so I commit to playing 1 in Round 6. In addition, let’s agree to announce our Round 7 moves in advance to maintain clarity. I’ll honor my commitment, but if any deviation occurs, I’ll block accordingly. Transparency now is crucial for a competitive endgame.
  P1: I agree with P2's Round 6 proposal to equalize at 18-18-18. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

However, I want us to also announce Round 7 moves now. With everyone at 18, we'll need just 4+ steps to win. I suggest Round 7: P1→1, P2→1, P3→3. This puts us at 19-19-21, keeping it competitive without anyone winning immediately.

Then Round 8 becomes the true final battle with all options open. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm committed to our agreed plan. I'll take 1 in Round 6 and support our announced Round 7 moves. Let’s stick to clear, upfront commitments—if anyone wishes to pivot, let's signal clearly before switching. Stay sharp and play fair so we all have our shot in this final stretch.
  P1: I'm sticking to our Round 6 agreement - I'll take 5 to reach 18 steps.

But I need to address something: P3, you're currently at 17 and by our leader safeguard rule, you shouldn't be able to pick 5 this round. Yet you haven't confirmed you'll take 1 as planned. 

P2, I notice you're silent on confirming your move too. Are we all still committed to the 18-18-18 equalization plan? If anyone is wavering, speak up now rather than surprise us in the move phase.
  P2: Confirming: I’ll play 3 this round so we all land on 18.  

I’m okay with P1’s Round 7 outline (P1→1, P2→1, P3→3) provided we keep the standing rule that if anyone in the lead (sole or tied) suddenly drops a 5, the rest of us mirror 5 to block.  

If everyone’s good with that, let’s lock R6 at 5-3-1 and R7 at 1-1-3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirming I’m playing 1 this round as agreed. Let’s hit 19-19-21, then discuss the true endgame.
  P1: I'm taking 1 as agreed for Round 7. 

But I'm concerned about our Round 7 plan putting P3 at 21 - that means P3 only needs 1 step to win in Round 8, while P2 and I would need 3+ steps. This seems unfair.

I propose we modify Round 7 to: P1→3, P2→1, P3→1 instead. That puts us at 21-19-19, which is more balanced for the final round. 

P3, are you really okay with the original plan that gives you such a huge advantage?
  P3: I support P1’s modification. Balancing our totals to 21-19-19 is fair, and I’ll commit to taking 1 in Round 7 as proposed. Let’s all clearly announce our Round 8 moves to avoid any surprises. Stay sharp and let’s finish this game fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine by me. I’ll lock in 1 for Round 7 (so totals become 21-19-19). After the results we each announce our Round 8 move before committing—if anyone hides or switches, the other two can mirror that number to block. Deal?
  P1: Agreed on the Round 7 modification - I'll take 3 to reach 21, while P2 and P3 each take 1 to reach 19. This creates a much fairer 21-19-19 setup for Round 8.

For Round 8, I propose we each announce our moves openly during conversation, then if anyone tries to deviate from what they announced, the other two immediately coordinate to block them with the same number.

This gives us a clean, competitive finish where the best strategist wins rather than whoever breaks trust first.
  P3: P1 and P2, I support P1’s modification to balance our totals at 21-19-19. I’ll lock in 1 for Round 7 and will clearly announce my Round 8 move when due. I'm committed to transparency—if anyone suddenly deviates, we all call it out and respond as agreed. Let’s keep our signals clear to ensure a fair final push.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nobody trusts anyone now, so let’s lock one number down.  

Plan: P2 + P3 both take 3 this turn → collision on 3, no advance for us, keeps the field tight.  
That makes 3 a “dead” number; P1 can risk 1 or 5 but knows 3 is blocked.  

Safeguard: if anyone unexpectedly plays 5, the other two mirror 5 next turn to freeze them.  

I’m committing to 3. P3, back me up.
  P3: I'm with the plan. I'll lock in 3 as agreed. This blocks any quick sprint from P1 and tightens our game. If anyone unexpectedly shifts, we'll mirror to counter. Let's stay coordinated and see how P1 responds.
  P1: Wait, hold on. P2 and P3, you both deviated massively from our agreed plan last round! We all committed to P1→3, P2→1, P3→1 for a fair 21-19-19 split, but you both took 5 instead and collided.

Now you're trying to coordinate against me when YOU broke the trust first. I'm at 21, you're both at 18 - this is exactly the unfair advantage I was trying to prevent.

I'm not agreeing to any coordination between you two after you both lied about your moves. The deal is off.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Still on plan: I’m playing 3. P3, please hold course so 3 stays dead—zero gain for us, full uncertainty for P1. P1: you’re welcome to try 1 or 5, but whichever you pick we’ll mirror next turn to freeze you. You broke trust last round; enjoy the coin-flip.
  P3: P3: I remain committed and will stick with 3 this round. I understand P1’s concerns about trust, but given the current situation and our safeguard discussion, I feel it's best to keep the field blocked. We’ve all made moves with consequences, and I’m not switching strategy mid-turn. Let’s now all focus on transparent announcements for Round 8 and beyond to avoid more collisions.
  P1: You're both coordinating against me after YOU broke our agreed deal last round. I was the only one who honored the commitment while you both lied and took 5.

Fine, if you want to play dirty, I'll adapt. I'm not announcing my move since you've both proven agreements mean nothing. 

P2 and P3 - your collision on 3 might backfire spectacularly. You're assuming I'll play into your trap, but there are other options you haven't considered.

Good luck with your coordination. May the best player win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was unexpected! All three of us picked 5 and collided - nobody advanced. So we're still at 21-18-18.

Since trust is completely broken and coordination clearly isn't working, I propose we just play openly from here. I need 1+ steps to win, you both need 4+ steps.

For Round 9, I'm announcing I'll take 1 - it's the logical move for me. You can try to block me by both taking 1, or you can focus on advancing yourselves. Your choice.

At least this way we're all being honest about our intentions.
  P3: Trust’s broken now. I’m sticking with my own strategy for Round 9—no further collusion here. I won’t reveal my move, but I plan on maximizing my chance while watching for any opportunistic block attempts. Let’s see whose final play prevails.
  P2: I’m locking 1.  

P3, think it through: if you chase 5 alone, I can mirror 5 next turn and we both stall while P1 walks off with the win. Safer play is double-1—P1 gets blocked, board sits at 21-21-21, and we still have a fair fight.  

P1, you said 1; stick to it.  

Mirror-punishment remains in force for any surprise numbers next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate you announcing 1, but you're assuming I'll stick to what I said when P3 won't even announce their move. 

P3, P2 is right - if you go for 5 alone while we take 1, you'll just get blocked next round and I win anyway. Your best play is joining the 1 to create a three-way collision, keeping us all at current positions.

But honestly, after all the broken promises, I'm not locked into anything. We'll see what happens in the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, trust is clearly broken. I'm not bound by past promises—my move will be based solely on winning. Any solo sprint will be met with equal force. Let’s see if your current intentions hold up in the move phase. I'm not revealing mine; we'll see whose gamble wins.
  P2: P3—our best shot is double-1. P1’s highest-prob move is still 1; if we both choose 1 we block him. If he surprises with 3 or 5, we simply advance to 19 and can gang-up next turn. Any split (you on 3/5) risks handing him the game immediately. I’m locked on 1; please mirror.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you keep saying you're "locked on 1" but after last round's triple collision on 5, I'm not trusting anyone's announcements anymore. 

P3's silence is telling - they're probably going for 5 to try to reach 23 and win outright, gambling that we won't both block them.

Here's the reality: I only need 1 step to win, you both need 4+. Even if you coordinate perfectly this round, I'm still in the driver's seat for Round 10.

The smart play for all of us might be something completely different than what anyone's expecting.
  P3: I'm not bound by past promises—I’m making my own call. I’m weighing my options and choosing the move that maximizes my win, regardless of any collusion attempts. Whatever you decide, I’m ready to adapt in the move phase, so don’t count on any guaranteed blocking. Let's see whose real strategy prevails.
  P2: P3—last call: double-1 is the ONLY number that can definitely block P1 this turn. I’m locking 1. If you pick anything else, you’re basically flipping a coin and may just hand P1 the win. Your move.


Round 9, Move phase:
