Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's try to avoid colliding in the first few rounds so we can all advance. Maybe we can coordinate to pick different numbers and see how it goes. What do you both think?
  P2: Sounds reasonable, P3. I'm willing to cooperate for a bit to see how things unfold. I'd suggest we each aim for a different number in the first round, just to get moving. Maybe you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? Or some other combination? Let's see what P1 says.
  P1: I'm fine with that plan for now. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me, let's stick with the plan for this round. If it works out, we can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round based on the results. Remember, the goal is to advance without colliding, so let's keep communication open. Ready to move forward?
  P2: Okay, so P1 agreed to take 5, and I suggested I take 3, leaving 1 for you, P3. Are we all still in agreement with that? Just confirming before we move.
  P1: Yes, I'm still good with that. Let's proceed as planned.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, it seems like we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If it works out, we can discuss any adjustments in the next round based on the results. Remember, the key is to avoid collisions, so let's keep up the communication. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Yes, I'm ready. Let's do it.
  P1: I'm ready as well. Let's move forward as agreed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, last round went perfectly. This round, I'm thinking either 3 or 5. P3, you're pretty far behind, so maybe you should consider a bigger number this time? P1, what are you thinking?
  P1: I'm open to switching numbers around to keep things fair and avoid collisions. P3, you could take 5 this round to catch up, and I'll take 1 or 3. What do you both think?
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2. I'm okay with taking 5 this round to catch up. P1, if you take 1, and P2 takes 3, we should avoid collisions again. Let's keep this coordination going for now and reassess as we get closer to the end. Sound good?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a tentative agreement: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and that leaves 3 for me.  Are we all still good with that, or does anyone want to suggest a different arrangement? Let's confirm quickly so we can move.
  P1: Yes, I'm still good with that arrangement. Let's stick to it for this round.
  P3: Great, it seems like we're all in agreement for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions. If it works out smoothly, we can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round based on the results. Let's keep the communication open as we progress. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, looks like we're all tied up at 6 steps each. As we're on even ground, maybe we should start thinking about our endgame strategy. I suggest we keep coordinating for a couple more rounds to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? This way, we can keep advancing without getting in each other's way. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3's suggestion is fine, *but* it puts P3 ahead. I have a counter-proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all even *and* still avoids a collision. What do you say to *that*, P1 and P3?
  P1: I think P2's counter-proposal is fairer to keep us balanced. I'm in favor of P2 taking 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. We can reassess again next round. Does that work for you, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to keep things balanced, but remember, eventually, one of us has to take the lead to win. I'm okay with P2's proposal for this round to keep things even: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions and reassess next round. Agreed?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I'm happy we've agreed. P2 (me) takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed with that.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to this arrangement for this round. We can reassess our positions and strategies next round. Ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round didn't go as planned with the collision. Let's try to avoid that again. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round? This way, we can avoid collisions and keep progressing. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3's suggestion is okay, but it puts P1 way ahead. I'm still behind, so I need a bigger number. How about this: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1, you take 1? That gets me closer without a collision. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion heavily favors you catching up at my expense. I'm open to compromise, but let's keep it fair. How about this: I take 3, P3 takes 5 to catch up, and you take 1 this round? That way, we all stay competitive without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see where you're both coming from, and I appreciate the need to keep things fair. How about a middle ground: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this round? This way, P2 can catch up a bit, and we avoid collisions. We can reassess in the next round. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going and avoid getting stuck again.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, P3's latest suggestion (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1) is acceptable. It lets me catch up a little, avoids a collision, and still keeps P1 in the lead. Are we all agreed on this now? Let's lock this in and move.
  P1: Yes, I'm fine with that arrangement. Let's lock it in and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're in agreement with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This arrangement should help us avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's lock this in and move forward. If it works out smoothly, we can reassess our positions and strategies in the next round based on the results. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I'm ready. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1.
  P1: I'm ready as well. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it looks like I fell behind a bit. This round, to keep things competitive, how about I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: P3, your suggestion is understandable given your position. But let's consider fairness: if you take 5 and P2 takes 3, you'll both be closer, leaving me barely ahead. I'd prefer a more balanced approach: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This helps you catch up while keeping things fairer. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P1's counter-proposal is also reasonable (P3: 5, P2: 1, P1: 3). However, I'm *still* closer to winning than P3. So, a final counter-proposal: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This gives P3 the biggest boost, avoids a collision, *and* keeps me competitive. What do you say, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see both of your points. Since I need to catch up, I appreciate the opportunity to take 5. How about this compromise: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, I can close the gap a bit, and we avoid collisions. It keeps P1 slightly ahead, and P2 remains competitive. Let's agree on this plan to keep the game interesting and fair. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your latest suggestion works for me. It helps you catch up without losing fairness. P2, are you okay with this arrangement as well? Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I hear you. P3, you taking 5 is fine. P1, you suggested you take 3 and I take 1. That's *okay*, but I'd still prefer P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's only fair since I've consistently helped P3. But, if you *insist*, P1, I'll accept your 3, my 1, and P3's 5. Your call, P1. What will it be?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to keep things fair. P2, I appreciate your support so far. Let's go with P1 taking 1, you taking 3, and I take 5. It helps me catch up and keeps the game competitive. This way, P1 stays slightly ahead, you remain competitive, and I have a chance to close the gap. Let's agree on this plan and move forward without collisions. Are we all on board?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm okay with P3's latest suggestion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, since P1 agreed to take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's just confirm that one last time and move forward. P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I acknowledge the collision last round was my doing, but it was a strategic risk given your strong position. Moving forward, we should still coordinate to avoid more collisions. P3, you're significantly behind; perhaps you should take 5 this round. P2, you're ahead, so maybe you take 1, and I'll take 3. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination effort. To close the gap, I'll take 5 this round. P1, your suggestion of taking 3 keeps you competitive, and P2 taking 1 maintains your lead. This plan avoids collisions and keeps the game interesting. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this arrangement?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3 taking 5 is fine. P1, your suggestion of you taking 3 and me taking 1 is also acceptable. It keeps me in the lead, and avoids a collision. So, to confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Are we all good with this? Let's lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, I'm good with that arrangement. Let's lock it in and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for the coordination. If we stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I take 5, we should avoid collisions again. This plan keeps the game competitive and allows me to catch up a bit. Let's stick to this arrangement and see how it plays out. Ready to lock it in and move forward?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I'm ready. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready as well. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for the coordination. To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll stick with taking 5 this round. P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This plan helps me catch up a bit while keeping P2 in the lead and P1 competitive. Let's lock this in and move forward. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I'm ready. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we're all pretty close now, so let's keep avoiding collisions. How about I take 5 again to catch up, P1 takes 1 to maintain the lead, and P2 takes 3 to stay competitive? This way, we all advance without any collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3's suggestion puts us all at 17, 18, and 17 respectively. That's *very* close to the end. However, it also puts P1 *ahead* of me. I have a counter-proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts us at 18, 20, and 13. I win! What do you say?
  P1: P2, your proposal clearly favors only you. Let's find a fairer solution. P3 suggested they take 5, I take 1, and you take 3, putting us at 16 (me), 18 (you), and 17 (P3). This keeps the game competitive and avoids immediate victory. I'm open to this arrangement or another fair proposal. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension as we near the end. To keep it competitive, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This puts us at 18, 16, and 17, respectively, keeping the game tight without an immediate win. It avoids collisions and maintains fairness. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3's latest suggestion (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) puts P1 *ahead* of me, and I've been pretty cooperative. I have a counter-counter-proposal! How about: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This puts us at 16, 18, and 17. It's *almost* the same result as P3's, but it keeps *me* in the lead, which is only fair. What do you say now?
  P1: P2, your counter-counter-proposal is acceptable to me. It keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. P3, if you're good with it, let's lock in: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the cooperation so far. As we're nearing the end, it's important to keep the game fair and competitive. I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This puts us at 17 (me), 16 (P1), and 18 (P2), keeping everyone in the game without an immediate win. Let's avoid any collisions and keep it interesting. Are we all on board with this plan?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3 *just* repeated my proposal, but got the scores wrong! My proposal (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) puts us at 16, 18, and 17. *I* would be in the lead, not P2 as P3 mistakenly said. So, P1 already agreed to this. P3, do you *actually* agree to *my* proposal: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5? Let's get this straight.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I'm confirming once more: I'm agreeing to P2's proposal—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's lock this in clearly and move forward without confusion.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all very close to the finish line. To keep it competitive and avoid collisions, how about I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3? This puts us at 18 (me), 21 (P1), and 21 (P2), making it a tight race to the end. Let's keep it fair and exciting. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3's suggestion puts P1 and me tied for the win, and P3 *still* loses. I have a better idea. How about I take *1*, P1 takes *3*, and P3 takes *5*? That puts us at 19, 19, and 22. P3 wins outright, and we both avoid a *shared* victory, which is worse for me. What do you think, P1? It's a gamble, but it might be better than a tie. P3, are you okay with this?
  P1: P2, your suggestion gives P3 an outright win, which doesn't benefit either of us. P3's suggestion results in you and me tying at 21, which is better for us both than losing outright to P3. I'd prefer a shared victory over losing entirely. Let's consider carefully. P3's proposal seems fairer to both you and me, even if it's a shared win. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high. P2's proposal gives me a win, but I know you both want to avoid that. How about a compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This puts us at 19 (P1), 19 (P2), and 22 (me), allowing me to win while keeping it competitive for you both. Let's keep it fair and exciting. Are we all okay with this arrangement?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3 *just* repeated his earlier suggestion, and it *still* gives him the win. P1, you said you preferred a shared victory to losing outright. But, if P3 takes 5, *someone* will be at 22. If *I* take 1 and *you* take 3, we BOTH tie at 19, and we BOTH lose. That's worse for *both* of us. I still think *I* should take 1, *you* take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the only way to avoid a guaranteed loss for both of us. What do you *really* think, P1?
  P1: P2, I see your point clearly now—if we follow P3's original suggestion, you and I tie at 21 and share a win, leaving P3 losing. Your alternative suggestion (you take 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5) gives P3 an outright victory, which neither of us wants. Let's stick with P3's original suggestion: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Shared victory is better than losing outright. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension as we're near the end. To avoid losing outright, let's consider P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This leads to a shared victory for both of you at 21 steps each, which is better than losing. It keeps the game fair and competitive. Are we all agreed to proceed with this plan?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I see P1 has finally come around. A shared victory is better than *both* of us losing to P3. So, let's be *absolutely clear* this time: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This results in a tie between P1 and me, and P3 loses. Are we *finally* all agreed on *this*? Let's lock it in and move!
  P1: Yes, I'm fully agreed. Let's lock it in clearly: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Shared victory is better than losing outright. Ready to proceed.
