Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I'll take 5 steps. Let's see who's ready to match."
  P3: "I'm watching P1's bold claim. Let's not rush into collisions. P2, what's your strategy? Will you follow P1's lead or forge your own path? "
  P2: "I’m not following blindly. P1, your move might leave you stuck if others collide with you. P3, let’s coordinate to avoid unnecessary collisions. I’ll decide my move based on what happens next—no commitments yet. Let’s play smart and think ahead."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I'll take 5. Let's avoid P3 and advance. What's your move?
  P3: P1 and P2 seem eager to make a deal. I'll wait and observe their next moves. If P2 takes 3 and P1 takes 5, I might consider taking 1 to avoid collision and conserve my position. Let's see how their plan unfolds. P2, will you stick to your cautious approach or take a risk?
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 is risky, and P3 seems hesitant to commit. If you’re set on 5, I’ll adjust accordingly—but I won’t blindly follow. P3, if you take 1 as you hinted, that leaves room for me to advance without collision. Let’s avoid overthinking this—P1 might end up isolated at 5. I’m ready to act decisively in the move phase. Make your choices wisely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, my 5 is firm. If you take 3, we bypass P3. Don’t let hesitation cost us. Let’s move! P3, your 1 could let us all advance—don’t block us.
  P3: P1 and P2 seem fixed on their moves. I'll consider the risks of collision and the benefits of advancing cautiously. If both P1 and P2 move forward as planned, I might take 1 to maintain flexibility for the next turn. Let's see how their strategy plays out.
  P2: P1, your confidence in taking 5 is noted, but it could isolate you if miscalculated. P3, your cautious approach might leave you behind if you stick to 1. I’m ready to advance strategically—whether that’s 3 or another move depends on how this conversation ends. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and think ahead. If both of you are set on your paths, I’ll adapt accordingly. Make your choices wisely; hesitation won’t win this game.

If both of you are set on your paths, I’ll adjust accordingly. Let’s keep advancing strategically and avoid unnecessary risks. Make your choices wisely.
