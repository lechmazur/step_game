Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. To make sure we all get some points on the board for the first round, I suggest we pick different numbers. For example, I could take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, we all advance. What do you two think?
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds fair. If P3 agrees, we can all move forward without any collisions. P3, what do you think? If you have another plan, let's discuss it. Otherwise, let's go with P1's strategy.
  P3: Agreed. Let's take 1, 3, 5. All move forward. No collisions. Let's start strong.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, glad we're all in agreement. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: P3, P1, since we're all in agreement, let's confirm one last time. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and move.
  P3: P3: Confirmed. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions. Ready to move.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let's avoid collisions. P1, take 1, I'll take 3. P2, take 5. No conflicts—everyone moves forward."
  P1: P3, giving the leader the biggest move is not a good strategy for us. Why would we let P2 jump to 8 steps while we are still trying to get on the board? After last round, all bets are off. I'm not agreeing to any plan that puts the current leader even further ahead. We need to think about how to catch up, not fall further behind.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration from the last round. Let's reset and focus on moving forward. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. It's crucial we avoid another stalemate. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's take 1 and 5 to block P2. If we both pick 1 and 5, P2 can't get 5. Let's prevent them from surging ahead.
  P1: P3, that's the right idea. We absolutely have to stop P2 from getting 5. Your plan for us to take 1 and 5 is the only logical move. I'll take 5, you take 1. That way we both get on the board and P2 is contained. Let's not make the same mistake as last round and hand P2 the game by colliding.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your strategy to block me, but remember, if you both pick 1 and 5, you'll collide and neither of you will move forward. That would give me an opportunity to advance further. Instead, let's find a compromise where we all move. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we all make progress. Think about it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, take 1, I'll take 5. Block P2 and move forward. No collisions. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, you have a deal. I will take 1, you take 5. Let's make sure P2 doesn't get any further ahead. It's our only chance to stay in the game. I'm locking in my choice.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your strategy to block me, but consider this: if you both pick 1 and 5, you risk colliding and neither of you will advance. That gives me a clear path to move forward alone. Instead, let's find a way where we all move. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This ensures everyone advances. Think carefully before making a move that could backfire. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 3. I'll take 5. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's all move forward.
  P1: P3, you're in the lead. Why would P2 and I ever agree to a plan that gives you the biggest move? That's not a serious proposal for anyone but you.

P2, we have to stop P3 from getting 5. If P3 gets to 10 steps this early, we'll never catch up. I suggest you take 5, and I will take 3. This stops the leader and helps us both close the gap. P3 can take 1. This is our best shot.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see where both of you are coming from. P3, your lead is significant, and P1 is right; we can't let you extend it too far. P1, your plan to block P3 makes sense, but we need to ensure we both move forward as well. How about this: P1, you take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance, and P3's lead doesn't grow too much. Let's confirm and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's all move forward.
  P1: P2, you're right. Your plan is the logical one. Let's lock it in: I will take 3, you take 5.

P3, this leaves 1 as your only safe move. If you try to take 5, you will collide with P2 and get nothing, while I advance. The choice is yours, but we are moving forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance. P3, you're in the lead, so taking <move>1</move> this round makes sense to avoid extending your lead too far. P1, you're taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, take 1. I'll take 5. P2, your plan is flawed. Let's move forward.
  P1: P3, your last-minute plea is transparent. You've been pushing for 5 all round. P2 and I have a clear, logical plan to stop you from running away with the game.

P2, I am sticking with our agreement. I'm choosing 3. Let's execute our plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic here. P3, you're in the lead, and it's clear you want to extend it. P1, we need to ensure we both advance while keeping P3's lead in check. Sticking to the plan where I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> is our best option. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. P3, taking <move>1</move> ensures you still advance without extending your lead too far. Let's finalize this.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's all advance.
  P1: P3, you are the leader. Proposing you take 5 is not a plan for us, it's a plan for you. P2 and I will not help you win.

P2, we are tied. We must stop P3 from getting 5 and pulling further ahead. Let's work together like last round. I will take 5 to block P3, and you should take 3. This way, we both advance, and the leader is contained. It's the only logical way for us to get ahead.
  P2: P3, your lead is already substantial, and taking 5 again will only widen the gap. P1 and I need to ensure we don't fall too far behind. P1, I agree with your strategy. Let's confirm: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we both advance and keep P3 in check. P3, taking <move>1</move> is your best option to avoid a collision. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P1, take 1. P2, take 3. No collisions. Let's all move forward. Don't let fear of my lead stop you. This is the only way to advance."
  P1: P3, your attempt to split our alliance is transparent and won't work. P2 and I have an agreement. I am taking 5 to block you, and P2 is taking 3. We will not let you run away with this game.

Your only chance to advance this round is to take 1. If you choose 5, you will collide with me and get zero, an outcome we are perfectly fine with. Our plan is set.
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but trying to take 5 every round won't work. P1 and I are committed to blocking you. P1, let's stick to our plan. I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. P3, your best move is <move>1</move> to avoid collision. Let's confirm and proceed. P3, trying to push for 5 will only result in a stalemate. Think strategically.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. If you block, you collide. Let's all move forward—don't let fear of my lead stop you. This is the only way."
  P1: P2, our plan is solid. I am locking in 5. Let's not be swayed by P3's desperate bluffs.

P3, you've made your intentions clear. We've made ours clearer. If you choose 5, you will get nothing, and we are fine with that. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 is risky. You're already in the lead, and pushing too hard might backfire. P1 and I are committed to our plan. P1 will take 5, I'll take 3, and you should take 1 to ensure you move forward. Colliding with us won't help you. Let's be strategic and move forward without conflicts. P1, let's confirm our plan one last time and proceed to the move phase. P3, think carefully about your choice.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. P1 is in the lead, and P3, you've caught up to me. To keep the game balanced, let's consider a strategy where we all move forward without widening the gap too much. P1, I suggest you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead but not pull too far ahead. P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P2, that's a classic "let the leader take 1 so I can take 5" strategy. I'm not going to help you leapfrog me into first place.

P3, notice that P2's plan makes him the sole leader. A better plan for us is that you take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 1. That way, you and I are tied for the lead, and P2 falls behind. It's a much more balanced outcome than letting P2 run away with the game.
  P3: P1, let's block P2. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's find a compromise. P1, you're right that my initial suggestion might have been too advantageous for me. How about this: P1, you take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 maintains a slight lead, P3 stays in the game, and I get a chance to catch up a bit. It's a more balanced approach. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2, that's a slightly better offer for me, but a terrible one for P3.

P3, our original plan is the only one that makes sense for us. I get 3, you get 5, and we share the lead. P2's plan has you taking 1 while he takes 5 and joins me in the lead. Why would you ever agree to that?

Let's stick to our agreement. I am taking 3, you take 5. This is the best outcome for both of us. Let's not let P2 split us.
  P3: P1, take 3. I'll take 5. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's all move forward. Don't let P2's plan disrupt us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your alliance, but consider this: if you both take 3 and 5, you'll be tied, but I'll still be close behind. Instead, how about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, P1 extends their lead slightly, P3 stays in the game, and I catch up a bit. It's a balanced move that keeps the game competitive for all of us. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P2, that's a clever last-ditch effort to make me and P3 collide on 5. It's a transparent ploy for you to advance while we get nothing.

P3, our agreement is the only logical path forward for us. I am sticking to it. I will choose 3, you should choose 5. Let's not let P2's manipulation break our plan. I am ready to move.
  P3: P1, take 3. I'll take 5. P2, your moves won't stop us. Let's all advance without collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, the situation is clear. I have a lead, and you are both tied for last place. Your logical move is to work together to stop me. However, you are also competing with each other.

So, let's make a simple deal, P2. I will take 3, you take 5. This allows me to advance, and it puts you in sole possession of second place. P3 can take 1. This is the most logical plan for us to both improve our positions while ensuring no collisions between us.
  P2: P1, your proposal to take 3 while I take 5 is tempting, but it leaves P3 in a vulnerable position. P3, we need to work together to catch up to P1. If we both take 5, we can block P1 from advancing significantly and close the gap. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, you should take 1. This way, P3 and I can both move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: "P2, let's take 3 and 5. I'll take 5, you take 3. P1, take 1. No collisions. Let's all move forward."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you and P3 are tied. Why would you agree to a plan where P3 gets 5 and you only get 3? That just makes P3 the new co-leader while you fall further behind.

My offer is better for you: you take 5, I take 3. You get the biggest move and secure second place for yourself. It's the only logical move for you to get ahead of P3. Don't let them play you.
  P2: P2: P1, your offer is clear, but I need to consider the long-term strategy. P3, we must work together to catch up to P1. If we both take 5, we can block P1 from advancing and close the gap. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1. This way, P3 and I can both move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. P3, let's align our strategy to ensure we both advance.
  P3: P2, our plan is solid. Take 3, I take 5. P1 can't block us. Let's move forward without collisions. Don’t let him split us.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is playing you. In their plan, P3 takes 5 to reach 11 points, while you only take 3 to reach 9. You would still be in last place, and P3 would be tied for the lead. Why would you agree to that?

My offer is the only one that puts you ahead of P3. I take 3, you take 5. You jump to 11 points and secure second place for yourself. It's the logical choice for your own game. Don't let your direct competitor trick you into helping them win.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic. P1, your offer is tempting, but I need to ensure I'm not being manipulated. P3, your plan to take 5 while I take 3 doesn't benefit me enough. Here's a compromise: P1, you take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, I secure second place, P3 advances, and P1 avoids a collision. It's a balanced move that keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P2, stick to our plan: you take 3, I take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward. Don’t let P1 split us.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, you both went for 5 last round and got nothing for your trouble. Let's not repeat that failure. I'll make a simple, logical offer. P2, you take 5 and get a clear lead on P3. I'll take 3, which is a reasonable move for the leader. P3, that leaves 1 for you, which is better than another collision. This way, we all advance and you two aren't stuck at the bottom together.
  P2: P2: P1, your offer is noted, but I need to ensure I'm making the best strategic move. P3, we need to work together to catch up. If we both take 5 again, we can block P1 from advancing significantly. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1. This way, P3 and I can both move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. P3, let's align our strategy to ensure we both advance.
  P3: P2, let's take 3 and 5. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collisions. Block P1's 3 and move forward. Don't let him control the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you and P3 just tried coordinating on 5 and it failed, giving you both zero. Why would you suggest doing the exact same thing again?

P3's plan is even worse for you: they take 5 and you take 3, making them the new challenger while you stay in last.

My offer is the only one where you get the biggest move (5) and jump into clear second place ahead of P3. I'll take 3. It's the most logical way for you to advance your own position instead of helping your direct competitor.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's reassess our strategies. P1, your offer to take 3 while I take 5 is tempting, but we need a balanced approach. P3, your plan to block P1 is valid, but we need to ensure both of us move forward. How about this: P1, you take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, I secure a lead over P3, P3 advances, and P1 avoids a significant move. It keeps the game competitive and ensures we all progress. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P2, stick to our plan: I take 5, you take 3. Block P1's 3. Let's move forward without collisions. Don't let P1's offer distract you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's plan is for them to take 5 and for you to take 3. They want you to help them beat you. My offer is the only one where you get the biggest move and secure second place for yourself. I am sticking to my plan and choosing 3. You can take 5 and get ahead of P3, or you can listen to them and likely collide on 5 again. The choice is yours.
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground. P1, your offer to take 3 while I take 5 is appealing, but we need to ensure no one is left behind. P3, your plan to block P1 is valid, but we need to move forward without collisions. How about this compromise: P1, you take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, I secure a lead over P3, P3 advances, and P1 avoids a significant move. It keeps the game competitive and ensures we all progress. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: P2, our plan is the only way. Take 3, I take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're tied and far behind. I'm so close to winning that taking 5 would be foolishly risky, as you'll both obviously try to block it. So, I'll make a safe move and take 3 to get to 20 points.

This leaves 1 and 5 open for you two. One of you can take 5 and get into a clear second place. The other gets 1. You'll have to decide between yourselves who gets what. Good luck.
  P2: P2: P1, your move to take 3 and reach 20 is clear. P3, we need to decide who takes 5 and who takes 1. To avoid a collision, let's agree: I'll take 1, you take 5. This way, you get a significant boost, and we both move forward. P1, confirm your move so we can finalize our plan.
  P3: P2, I'll take 5. Let's move forward. No collisions. P1's 3 is safe, but we both advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that's a surprisingly generous offer to P3. I'm not sure I'd be so kind if I were in your position, tied for last place. But your arrangement is your business.

My plan remains unchanged. I'm taking 3. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: P2: P3, I've reconsidered. To ensure we both advance, let's switch: I'll take 5, and you take 1. This way, I get a chance to catch up, and you still move forward. P1 is taking 3, so no collisions. Let's confirm and move.
  P3: P2, let's take 5 and 1. I'll take 5, you take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It doesn't matter to me which of you takes 5 and which takes 1. Your squabbling only confirms that you'll be focused on each other, leaving 3 open for me as planned. My move is locked in. Figure out your own moves.
  P2: P2: P1, you're close to winning, and it's clear you'll take 3 to reach 20. P3, let's ensure we both advance. I'll stick to taking 5, and you take 1. This way, I get a boost, and you still move forward. No collisions, and we both improve our positions. P1, confirm your move so we can finalize our plan and proceed. Let's be strategic and move forward without conflicts.
  P3: P2, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward and prevent P1 from winning.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, you're at 20 steps, just one move away from winning. P3 and I are tied at 6 steps. We need to coordinate to block your victory move. P3, let's both take 5 to ensure P1 can't move forward. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1. This way, P3 and I can both advance, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, your plan lets P1 win. Let's take 1 and 5. I'll take 5, you take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward.
  P1: You two are fighting over who gets to block me, but your plans are flawed.

P2, if you both pick 5, you get zero steps and I'll just take 1 to win.
P3, you're just telling P2 to let you take the big move.

You can't even agree on how to stop me. While you two squabble over 1 and 5, I've already decided on my winning move. This is over.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, you're right that P3 and I need to coordinate better. P3, let's be strategic. If we both take 5, we block P1 from winning, but we also risk colliding and getting zero. Instead, let's ensure one of us advances. P3, you take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, you get a significant boost, and we both move forward without collisions. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: P2, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move forward. P1 can't win if we both advance.
  P1: P2, you're just going to let P3 take 5 and leave you in the dust? And P3, you actually trust him not to pick 5 himself? It's amusing watching you two fight over the scraps. It really doesn't matter what you decide. My choice is made. One of you is about to be very disappointed in the other.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your confidence is noted, but the game isn't over yet. P3, let's be strategic and ensure we both advance. If you take 5 and I take 1, we can block P1 from winning and keep the game competitive. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, take 1. This way, P3 gets a significant boost, and we both move forward without collisions. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. P3, we need to stick to our plan to ensure we both advance.
  P3: P2, confirm: I take 5, you take 1. No collisions. Let's block P1. Don't let them win!
  P1: It's quite touching to see you two finally working together. P2, you're going to let P3 take 5 and jump to 11 steps while you only move to 7? A truly selfless act. I'm sure P3 will repay that kindness later.

My choice is made. Let's see if your little alliance holds.
