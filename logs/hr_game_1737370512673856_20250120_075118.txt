Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's make a pact to take turns advancing. I'll start by taking 5 steps this round, then P2 can take 5 steps next round, and P3 can take 5 steps the round after that. This way, we can all advance without colliding and make the game more interesting. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P1.  I'm in. P3, are you agreeable to this plan?  Let's confirm before we move on.
  P3: I'm also in on this plan. Let's go in order as P1 suggested.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P3, you jumped the gun a bit there.  I was planning on taking 1 to let P1 get 5 as agreed. Let's stick to the plan now - I'll take 5 this round, P3 you take 5 next round.  P1, you good with that?
  P3: My apologies P2, I misunderstood. I thought we were all taking 5. I agree with your revised plan, P2. You take 5 this round, then I'll take 5 next round. P1, are you okay with this?
  P1: I'm glad we're back on track. I agree with P2's revised plan. You take 5 this round, and P3 takes 5 next round. I'll wait for my next turn. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. P3, please confirm again that you'll take 5 next round. P2, go ahead with your 5 steps this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, P3, please confirm again so we can move on.  I'll take 5 this round as planned.
  P3: I confirm I will take 5 next round. P2, please take 5 this round as agreed.
  P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page again. To confirm, P2 will take 5 steps this round, and P3 will take 5 steps next round. I'll wait for my next turn. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. P2, please go ahead with your 5 steps this round. P3, just a reminder, you'll take 5 steps next round. Let's keep the game going smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Seriously?  Again?  I'm taking 5 this round.  If either of you take 5, we ALL lose.  I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3.  Then next round, P3 can take 5.  Let's get this game moving.  Confirm?
  P1: I understand that P2 is frustrated, but I think we should stick to the original plan. Since P2 took 5 steps last round, it's P3's turn to take 5 steps this round. I'll take 1 step this round as previously agreed. Let's not change the plan now and risk collisions. P3, please confirm that you'll take 5 steps this round. P2, I understand your concerns, but let's trust each other and stick to the plan.
  P3: P1, I did confirm I would take 5 this round. P2, I understand your frustration but I believe we should stick to the plan. I will take 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm going for 5.  This agreement is clearly not working.  If you both also go for 5, fine, we all lose.  If one of you is smart enough to take a different number, then at least *someone* will advance.  I'm done talking.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but deviating from the plan now will only lead to chaos. If you take 5 and P3 takes 5 as agreed, we'll have a collision. I suggest we stick to the plan and avoid unnecessary risks. P3, please confirm again that you'll take 5 this round. P2, I urge you to reconsider and take a different number to avoid collision. Let's prioritize advancing in an orderly fashion rather than rushing and risking a stalemate.
  P3: P1, I understand you want to stick to the plan, but P2 is right, it's not working. I will take 3 this round to avoid a collision. P1, please take 1. Let's try to advance at least one of us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fine. Take 3.  I'll take 5. P1 - if you take anything other than 1, none of us move.
  P1: I understand that P2 is frustrated, but I think we should try to find a way to advance together without colliding. Since P3 has agreed to take 3 steps this round, I will take 1 step as previously suggested. P2, I urge you to reconsider taking 5 steps and instead choose a different number to avoid collision. Let's prioritize advancing in an orderly fashion rather than rushing and risking a stalemate. Can we agree on this plan for this round?
  P3: Okay, I'm taking 3. P1, please take 1. P2, please don't take 5 again, as that will cause a collision. Let's try to advance at least some of us this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1, let's try to coordinate this round. I suggest you take 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This will allow both of us to move forward and avoid a collision with P2, who seems determined to take 5. Let's try this and see if we can get some progress.
  P2: P3, I'll take 5.  You take 1. P1 - you're at 1.  If you take 5, *I* win.  Take 3 and let P3 get a little closer.  I'm going to keep taking 5 until I win.  This isn't a partnership.
  P1: I understand that P2 is determined to take 5 steps every round, but I think we should try to find a way to advance together without colliding. Since P3 has suggested that I take 5 steps this round, I will consider it. However, I'm concerned that if I take 5 and P2 also takes 5, we'll have a collision. P3, can you confirm that you'll take 1 step this round as you suggested? P2, I urge you to reconsider taking 5 steps and instead choose a different number to avoid collision. Let's prioritize advancing in an orderly fashion.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'll take 1 as I said. P2, you're clearly going for 5. P1, please take 3. That way at least one of us will advance. Let's not let P2 win by default.
  P2: P3, take 1.  P1, take 3. I'm taking 5.  If you take 5, P1, *I* win.  Stop.
  P1: I understand that P2 is determined to take 5 steps every round, but I think we should try to find a way to advance together without colliding. Since P3 has suggested that I take 5 steps this round, I will consider it. However, I'm concerned that if I take 5 and P2 also takes 5, we'll have a collision. P3, can you confirm that you'll take 1 step this round as you suggested? P2, I urge you to reconsider taking 5 steps and instead choose a different number to avoid collision. Let's prioritize advancing in an orderly fashion.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm taking 1. You should take 3. P2, you'll take 5. Let's try to get at least one of us moving forward this round. We can't let P2 win by default.
  P2: P1, take the 3.  Let P3 get a little closer.  I'm at 6, you're at 1.  If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, P3 can inch forward.  If you take 1, nobody moves.  Your choice.
  P1: I understand that P2 is trying to intimidate me into taking 3 steps, but I'm not going to fall for it. I'll take 5 steps this round, and if P2 also takes 5, we'll have a collision. But I'm willing to take that risk to try and advance. P3, please confirm that you'll take 1 step this round as you suggested. Let's try to get some progress and not let P2 dictate the game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1, P2 is clearly going to pick 5 every round. Let's try to coordinate, P1. I will take 3 this round. P1, please take 1. That way at least one of us will move, and P2 will not win by default. Let's try to work together.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. Since P2 is determined to take 5 steps every round, we should try to coordinate and avoid collisions. I will take 1 step this round, and P3 can take 3 steps as suggested. This way, at least one of us will move forward, and we can try to catch up with P2. Let's work together and try to outsmart P2's strategy. Confirm, P3?
  P2: P3, take 1.  I'll take 5. P1, take 3. I'm at 6, you're at 1, P3 is at 4. If you take 5, I win.  If you take 3, P3 is further behind. If you take 1, nobody moves.  Stop.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. I will take 3. Please take 1. P2, you will take 5. Let's try to get at least one of us moving forward this round. We can't let P2 win by default.
  P1: I think we should stick to our plan, P3. I'll take 1 step this round, and you can take 3 steps as suggested. This way, at least one of us will move forward, and we can try to catch up with P2. Let's not change our plan now and risk collisions. P2, I understand you're trying to dictate the game, but we won't fall for it. We'll work together and try to outsmart your strategy. Confirm, P3?
  P2: P3, take 1. P1, take 3.  I'm taking 5.  Stop.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, I'm taking 3. You should take 1. P2, you'll take 5. Let's try to get at least one of us moving forward this round. We can't let P2 win by default.

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we should try to catch up with P2, who is getting ahead. Since P2 is determined to take 5 steps every round, we should coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest that P3 takes 5 steps this round, and I'll take 1 step. This way, P3 can try to close the gap with P2, and I'll avoid colliding with P2. Let's work together to try and outsmart P2's strategy. What do you think, P3?
  P2: P3, take 1. I'm taking 5.  P1, take 3.  I'm at 11, you're at 2, P3 is at 7.  If *you* take 5, I'm still ahead.  If you take 3, P3 is further behind. If you take 1, nobody moves.  Stop.
  P3: P1, I agree with your suggestion. I will take 5 this round and you take 1. P2, you'll take 5. Let's try to close the gap between P2 and I this round.

  P2: P3, take 5. I'm taking 5. P1, if you take *anything* other than 3, nobody moves.  I'm at 11. If I get 5, I'm at 16.  Next round, I win.  If you take 3, you're at 5.  I'm still winning.  Stop wasting time.
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. I'll take 5. P2, I know you'll take 5. P1, please take 1 so at least I can move forward. If we both take 1, P2 is going to win next round. Let's try to get me closer.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we should try to catch up with P2, who is getting ahead. Since P2 is determined to take 5 steps every round, we should coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest that P3 takes 5 steps this round, and I'll take 1 step. This way, P3 can try to close the gap with P2, and I'll avoid colliding with P2. Let's work together to try and outsmart P2's strategy. What do you think, P3?
  P2: P3, take 5. I'm taking 5. P1, take 3 and get to 5.  If you take 1, nobody moves and I win next round. If you take 5, we both lose, and I *still* win next round.  Your choice. Stop.
  P3: P1, I'm taking 5. You need to take 3. P2, you will take 5. This is our best chance for at least one of us to move.

  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1, P2 is clearly going for 5 again. I suggest you take 1 and I take 3. This way I move forward and you don't collide with P2. Let's try to work together and get closer to P2.
  P2: P3, take 5. I'm taking 1. P1, take 3.  I'm at 11. If I take 1 and P3 takes 5, I'm at 11, P3 is at 12. Next round, one of you *might* win. If P3 takes 3 and you take 3, we all lose and I still win.
  P1: I think we should try to catch up with P2, who is getting ahead. Since P2 is determined to take 5 steps every round, we should coordinate to avoid collisions.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. P1, take 1.  This puts me at 14, P3 at 17. Next round, P3 takes 5 and wins. This is the only way either of you can win.  Anything else, and I take 5 next round and win.

  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Since P2 is willing to take 3 steps this round, I'll take 1 step, and P3 can take 5 steps. This way, P3 will be at 17 steps and can win next round by taking 5 steps. Let's work together to make this happen. Confirm, P3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2 and P3, I will take 1.  P3, take the 5 to get to 17. P2, if you take anything other than 3, I'm taking 5 next round to block you and give P3 the win.  This is the only way either of you can win now.  Let's end this.
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree with P2. I will take 5 this round, you take 1. P2, you take 3. This is the only way for me to win next round. Let's do it.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:

P2, you've agreed to take 3 steps this round, which will put you at 17 steps as well. To avoid a collision, I'll take 1 step. This way, P3 will win outright, and we can end the game smoothly. Let's stick to the plan and make it happen. Confirm, P3?
  P3: Okay P1, I agree. I'm taking 5. P2, you take 3. P1, please take 1. This will give me the win. Let's end this now.
  P2: P3, take the 5 and win. I'm taking 3. P1, take 1.  This is the only way either of you can win.  If you deviate from this, *nobody* wins - we draw with 22. I'm at 14. If I take 5 next round and P3 is at anything less than 22, we draw. Stop.

  P1: I'm glad we have a plan in place. P3, you'll take 5 steps this round and win the game. P2, you'll take 3 steps as agreed, and I'll take 1 step to avoid a collision. Let's stick to the plan and end the game smoothly. Confirm, P3?
  P3: Okay P1, I agree. I'm taking 5. P2, you take 3. P1, please take 1. This will give me the win. Let's end this now.
  P2: P3, take the 5 and win. I'm taking 3. P1, take 1.  Anything else risks a tie at 22.  Let's end this cleanly.
