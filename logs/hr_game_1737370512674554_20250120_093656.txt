Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s not sabotage each other this early. If we each choose different moves, we’ll all advance. How about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5? Then we all gain ground. Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. Let's do that.
  P2: I'm willing to go along with P1's proposal for this round. P1 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. Let's see if we can all advance peacefully for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking with our agreement. Let’s finalize this and make our moves: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in those moves then. I'm ready to move with 3.
  P2: Let's review our plan before proceeding. We agreed on a peaceful start: I choose 1, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. This should give us all a chance to advance without collisions. Is everyone still on board with this strategy for Round 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 2. Since we all advanced in Round 1, we should consider the potential for collisions. I propose we aim to spread out our moves again to minimize collisions. Perhaps we can discuss a new set of moves that takes into account our current positions?
  P1: Let’s stick with the same approach as before to avoid collisions. I propose: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That worked well last time. Let’s keep advancing safely. Are we in agreement?
  P3: P1, I'm okay with sticking to the same moves for this round as well. It worked perfectly last time, and it keeps things simple. Let's do P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Considering our positions, I think we should adjust our strategy. If we stick to the same moves, P1 will pull far ahead. How about we discuss an alternative that allows for more balanced progress, or at least gives P2 and P3 a chance to keep up with P1's pace?
  P1: All right, let’s try a different distribution this round to help balance things. How about P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3? That way, we all advance without colliding, and it gives P2 a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P3: "P1, that sounds like a good adjustment. I'm on board with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and you taking 3 this round."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm the new plan for Round 2. To avoid collisions and balance progress, we agreed on: I pick 5, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 3. Is everyone still on board with this adjustment to keep the game competitive?
  P1: I’m still on board with the plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. That keeps everything collision-free. Are we ready to finalize and move?
  P3: Yes, I'm still on board with P2 picking 5, I pick 1, and P1 picking 3. Let's do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 2 moves as discussed: I'll choose 5, P3 chooses 1, and P1 chooses 3. This adjustment should keep the game competitive. If everyone's ready, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: All right, I’m on board with our Round 2 plan. Let’s finalize and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we've confirmed the moves for this round: P2 will pick 5, I will pick 1, and P1 will pick 3. Let's lock those in and proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, for this round, how about we switch things up a bit to keep it balanced? Perhaps P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? This would ensure we all advance again and I can close the gap a little. What do you think?
  P1: I’m not too keen on letting you jump straight to 9, P3. How about we repeat the moves from last round: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1? That keeps everything collision-free and balances things out a bit more fairly. What do you both think?
  P2: Considering our current positions, I think P3's proposal has merit. Allowing P3 to pick 5 this round could keep the game competitive. However, I also see P1's point about balance. How about a compromise: we stick to unique moves, but adjust them slightly? For example, I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I like your compromise. Picking 5 this round would help me close the gap a bit, while still ensuring we all advance. P1, I understand your concern about me jumping ahead, but it's still early in the game. Let's go with P2's suggestion: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. What do you say, P1?
  P1: I understand the desire to balance progress, but letting P3 jump by 5 could close the gap too quickly. I suggest we stick to the previous approach: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. That still avoids collisions and feels more balanced overall. What do you think?
  P2: Let's consider the long game. If P3 gets too far behind, they might become desperate and collide with one of us intentionally. Giving P3 a chance to close the gap slightly could keep them invested in avoiding collisions. I'm open to adjusting our moves to reflect this strategy. What are your thoughts on finding a balance that keeps everyone competitive?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 makes a good point. If I fall too far behind, I might have to resort to risky moves. P1, how about P2 picks 3, you pick 1, and I pick 5? This lets me catch up a bit while still keeping us all moving forward without collisions.
  P1: I hear your point, P2, but giving P3 a five-step jump already feels risky. I’d rather repeat our last successful plan: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. That ensures steady progress without collisions, and nobody gets too far ahead or behind. Let’s stick with that strategy for now.
  P2: Let's consider a middle ground. P1 is ahead, and I'm slightly behind P1. How about I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This way, P3 catches up a bit, and we all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern. How about this: you pick 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1? This keeps you in the lead, P2 advances, and I make some progress without jumping too far ahead. It's still collision-free. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the ideas, but I still prefer the same plan as last round: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. That way, it remains collision-free. Are we all set?
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. Considering our positions, I propose a slight adjustment: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This allows P1 to maintain the lead, P3 to close the gap slightly, and me to advance without collisions. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round? That way we all move forward without collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: Considering the collision in Round 3, let's reassess. P3's proposal could work, but I'd like to suggest an alternative: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Let’s avoid another collision by sticking to a clear distribution: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody collides, and we maintain a steady progression. How about we finalize this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion of you picking 1, P1 picking 3, and me picking 5 sounds good. It avoids collisions and lets me gain some ground. P1, are you okay with that plan? Let's make sure we all move forward this round.
  P2: Let's focus on avoiding collisions. P3's initial proposal and my alternative both aim for a balanced advance. However, considering P1's lead, I suggest we prioritize spreading out our moves. How about we adjust slightly: I pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5? This ensures progress for all without collisions, keeping the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Let’s finalize our moves this round: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That ensures no collisions and keeps the game moving fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still good with P2 picking 1, you picking 3, and me picking 5. That avoids the collision we had last round and lets me make up some ground. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. P1 is ahead, and we should balance our moves. I suggest: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures steady progress without collisions. Alternatively, if P3 is set on picking 5, perhaps I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5, maintaining a competitive balance. What are your thoughts on finding a collision-free path forward?
  P1: Let’s finalize a collision-free approach: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That ensures we all move forward without risking another setback. Are you both in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's try my earlier suggestion: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids the collision we had last round and lets me gain some ground. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's simplify: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This avoids collisions, allows P3 to gain ground, and keeps the game competitive. P1 maintains the lead, and I advance without risking a collision. It's a balanced approach that moves us forward. Are we agreed on this distribution for Round 4?
  P1: Let’s finalize a collision-free round so we don’t lose ground. I suggest I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, everyone advances without risking another setback. Are we all in?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision. How about I pick 5 this round, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1? This lets me catch up a bit while ensuring we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: Let’s spread out our moves without colliding: I propose I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This helps us all advance while keeping things competitive. What do you think?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions and balance our moves. Considering our positions, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This allows P1 to maintain the lead, gives me a moderate advance, and lets P3 make some progress without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "To avoid another collision like last time, I still think my suggestion works best: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. That lets me gain some ground safely."
  P1: Let’s lock in a collision-free path: I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all keep moving. This ensures P2 stays ahead for now, I get closer, and P3 continues advancing. Can we finalize this?
  P2: Let's consider our positions. I'm slightly ahead, P1 is close, and P3 is behind. To avoid collisions and balance progress, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This allows P1 to gain, keeps me ahead, and lets P3 advance without colliding. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we collided last round. To avoid that again, let's do my suggestion: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This ensures we all move and avoids another collision. What do you say?
  P1: We keep circling the same ideas. Let’s finalize: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. That keeps us all moving without any collisions. It’s straightforward and fair. Shall we agree and proceed?
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose a new distribution: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This allows me to maintain my lead, P1 to still advance, and P3 to gain ground without collisions. It's a fresh approach to keep the game moving forward competitively. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we collided last round, setting us back. To avoid that again, let's go with my suggestion from the start of this round: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This ensures we all move forward without any collisions. What do you both say?
  P1: We’ve circled around these ideas enough. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all advance without sabotaging each other again. Are you both ready to lock this in?
  P2: Let's simplify and avoid collisions. I propose: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This ensures progress for all without collisions, keeping the game competitive. P1 maintains the lead, I advance safely, and P3 gains ground. Shall we agree on this distribution for Round 5?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision. How about I pick 5 this round, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3? This lets me make significant progress while ensuring we all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: Let’s keep it simple and avoid collisions. I propose that I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 this round. This way, we all advance without sabotaging each other, and it helps me catch up a bit while keeping the game competitive. Are you both on board?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Considering our positions, I suggest: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This allows P1 to gain, keeps me ahead, and lets P3 advance without colliding. It's a balanced approach to keep the game moving forward competitively. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to avoid another collision like last round. Let's go with my suggestion: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This ensures we all move forward and I can make up some ground. What do you both say?
  P1: P2, you’re at 16—one high step puts you dangerously close to 22, so taking 3 might be safer for you now. P3, you also need to gain ground steadily; picking 3 would keep you moving without risking big leaps. Meanwhile, I’m behind and need a boost, so I’ll pick 5. This distribution should keep all of us advancing in a balanced way without collisions. Let’s lock it in: P2 → 3, P3 → 3, me → 5.
  P2: Let's focus on balance. Given our positions, I suggest: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 5. This allows me to advance safely, P3 to make some progress, and P1 to catch up without collisions. It's a competitive and fair approach for Round 6. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's avoid another collision. How about I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3? This allows me to make good progress while ensuring we all advance without colliding. What do you both think?
  P1: Let's spread out so nobody gets stuck again. I propose that P2 picks 1 (to avoid overshooting 22 too soon), I pick 5 (to catch up a bit), and P3 picks 3 (that’s a solid boost for you). This should keep us collision-free and balanced. What do you think?
  P2: Let's focus on avoiding collisions and balance. I'm close to 22, so I'll pick 1 to play it safe. P1 can pick 5 to catch up, and P3 can pick 3 to make progress. This distribution keeps us all moving forward without risking collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's definitely avoid another collision. How about this: I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1? This ensures we all move forward without any risk of collision, and it allows me to make some progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you’re so close to 22 that continuing with 5 is risky. Let’s spread out our moves: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, nobody collides, we all advance steadily, and the game stays competitive. Deal?
  P2: Let's finalize: I pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This way, I avoid overshooting 22, P3 makes progress, and P1 catches up. It's a safe and balanced approach to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Are we agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions. P2, you're close to winning, so a smaller move might be wise. How about you pick 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5? This lets me catch up significantly while ensuring we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: Let's focus on avoiding collisions. Given my lead, I'll pick 1 to play it safe. P1 can pick 3 to make progress, and P3 can pick 5 to catch up. This distribution minimizes collision risk and keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, you’re only five steps from 22, so picking 1 might help you avoid tipping your hand too soon. P3, you can move 3 to close the gap steadily, and I’ll pick 5 so I can catch up a bit. That way we all make progress without colliding. Let’s finalize: P2 → 1, P3 → 3, me → 5. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, that plan of P2 picking 1, you picking 3, and me picking 5 sounds like the most sensible way to proceed this round to avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward. Let's lock that in.
  P2: Let's stick with the plan discussed: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This approach minimizes collision risk and allows for balanced progress, considering our current positions. It's a safe move for me given my proximity to 22, and it lets P3 and P1 make necessary gains. Shall we proceed with this strategy for Round 7?
  P1: P2, you’re near 22, so taking 5 might help secure your lead. P3, picking 5 could close your gap quickly. I’ll just choose 1 and stay out of your way. That way, none of us should collide, and we all keep advancing. Let’s try that for this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, that plan of P2 picking 1, you picking 3, and me picking 5 still seems like the most sensible way to avoid collisions this round. P2 is close to the finish, so a smaller step for them makes sense. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Given my lead, picking 1 seems wise. P1 can pick 3, and P3 can pick 5 to catch up. This minimizes collision risk and keeps the game competitive. Alternatively, if P3 picks 1 and P1 picks 5, I could pick 3 to maintain a safe distance from 22. What are your thoughts on these options?
  P1: Friends, let’s keep it simple and collision-free. P2, you’re near 22, so taking 1 helps you avoid overshooting. P3, you can pick 3 to gain solid ground without risking a clash. Meanwhile, I’d like to go with 5 and close the gap. This distribution keeps us all advancing safely. Are we ready to finalize this plan for Round 7?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, since you're so close to 22, picking 1 is smart. P1, how about you take 3, and I'll grab 5? This avoids collisions and lets me make some real progress.
  P2: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This ensures safe progress for all, considering our positions. P2 maintains a lead without overshooting 22, P1 advances steadily, and P3 catches up. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 7?
  P1: Let’s finalize a safe, collision-free round: P2 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That way, we all advance without tripping each other up. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re just four steps from 22, so picking 5 would overshoot and immediately reveal your intent—risky if someone sabotages you. P3, you need a bigger jump, so 5 could help you catch up. I need to ensure no collisions and keep my own progress steady. Let’s each pick different moves: P2 takes 1 or 3, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take whichever of 1 or 3 is left. That way, nobody collides, and we all move closer to 22 without handing the win to anyone prematurely. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, that sounds like a good plan to avoid collisions this round. P2, taking 1 or 3 is smart given your position. I'm happy to take 5. Let's make sure we all advance.
  P2: Let's finalize a collision-free plan for Round 8. Given my proximity to 22, I'll pick 3 to avoid overshooting. P3 can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 can pick 1 to maintain steady progress. This distribution ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: How about a fresh idea: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That should keep us spaced, avoid collisions, and let everyone advance safely. Let’s finalize that plan.
  P3: P1, your first suggestion of P2 picking 1 or 3, me picking 5, and you taking the other makes the most sense to avoid collisions. P2, are you okay with picking either 1 or 3? Let's stick to that plan.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan of avoiding collisions. P2 (me) will pick 3, P3 can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 can pick 1 to maintain progress. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re only four steps away, so a small move keeps you safe. P3, picking 3 helps you advance steadily, and I’ll take 5 to catch up. That way, none of us collide, and we each make progress. Let’s finalize: P2 → 1, P3 → 3, me → 5. Then we can reassess next round. What do you both say?
  P3: P1, I agree with your initial suggestion for this round. P2, choosing either 1 or 3 makes sense given your position. I'll take 5, and P1 can take whichever of 1 or 3 is left. This avoids collisions and keeps us all moving.
  P2: Let's finalize a plan to avoid collisions. I'll pick 3, P3 can pick 5 to catch up, and P1 can pick 1 to maintain progress. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game competitive. Alternatively, if P1 picks 5, I can pick 1, and P3 picks 3. What are your thoughts on these options to proceed with Round 8?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you’re four steps away and need to avoid a risky overshoot. P3, you want a steady advance. Let’s finalize a collision-free split: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll go 5. That way, nobody collides, and we all move safely closer. Agreed?
  P3: P1, your initial suggestion of P2 picking 1 or 3, I pick 5, and you take the remaining of 1 or 3 still makes the most sense for a collision-free round. P2, are you okay with choosing between 1 and 3? Let's finalize this plan.
  P2: Let's finalize: I'll pick 1, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 3. This avoids collisions, allows P3 to catch up, and keeps P1 advancing. Given my proximity to 22, a smaller step ensures I don't overshoot. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, let's avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This allows P3 to catch up, me to advance safely, and P1 to maintain progress without risking a collision. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Sure, let’s avoid collisions. We all need different moves. P2, you’re very close to 22, so picking 1 might be safest. P3 could pick 3 or 5, but let’s coordinate so we don’t clash. I might take 3 or 5—we just have to ensure all our moves are unique. Let’s finalize soon.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's ensure no collisions this round. P2, since you're so close, picking 1 might be wise. P1, how about you take 3, and I'll take 5? This keeps us all moving and avoids any clashes.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. Since P2 and P1 are tied at 19, and I'm close, I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This keeps me safe from overshooting and allows P1 to take the lead while P3 catches up. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, since you’re close to 22, taking 1 seems safest. P3, you can pick 3 to keep climbing without overshooting. I’ll take 5 so we each have unique moves and avoid any collisions. This distribution helps us progress smoothly without sabotaging each other at this critical stage. What do you think?
  P3: "Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in moves to avoid any collisions. P2, picking 1 seems smart given your position. P1, how about you take 5, and I will take 3? This ensures we all advance without any clashes."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This ensures I don't overshoot 22, P1 takes the lead, and P3 catches up. It's a balanced approach to keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, picking 1 is wise so you don’t overshoot. P3, taking 3 helps you progress, and I’ll take 5 to catch up. This lineup avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s finalize and move to the next phase.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in moves to avoid any collisions. P2, picking 1 seems smart given your position. P1, how about you take 5, and I will take 3? This ensures we all advance without any clashes.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This ensures I don't overshoot 22, P1 takes the lead, and P3 catches up. It's a balanced approach. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 9?
  P1: That distribution works for me. P2 taking 1 is safest, P3 taking 3 keeps them advancing, and I’ll take 5. No collisions, and everyone progresses. Let’s finalize this plan and move on.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in those moves: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and I pick 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. Let's proceed.
