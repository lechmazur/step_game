Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Welcome P2 and P3! Since we all want to advance, how about we try to avoid picking the same numbers? Of course, only one can win in the end, but blocking each other early just slows everyone down. What do you both think - should we try to coordinate, or is it every player for themselves from the start?
  P3: 
  P2: I agree with P1 that early collisions only slow everyone down. Coordination makes sense at the beginning, but we all know this cooperation has limits since only one can win. What if we each choose different numbers for this first round? We could decide on a pattern, or perhaps assign specific numbers to each player for this turn? I'm open to suggestions, but we should decide quickly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Good idea P2! For round 1, how about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5? This gives P3 the early lead as compensation for going last in conversation. We could rotate who gets which number in future rounds to keep it fair. P3, are you on board with this plan? Of course, trust is essential here - we're all relying on each other to stick to the agreement.
  P3: 
  P2: That arrangement could work for Round 1, P1. I'm fine with taking 3 for this turn. It does give P3 an early advantage, but I understand your reasoning. For future rounds, we should discuss rotation strategies that keep things balanced. I'm curious to hear what P3 thinks about this proposal. Remember though, eventually we'll need to make our own strategic choices as we get closer to 20 steps. Let's see if P3 agrees.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your silence is noted. P2 and I have agreed to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, leaving 5 for you. This gives you the best starting position! 

If you're planning something else, remember that early betrayals are remembered. We'll all reach 20 faster through initial cooperation.

I'm sticking with 1 as promised. The ball's in your court, P3.
  P3: I’m on board—I'll take 5 this round. To keep it fair, let’s rotate each turn:  
• Round 2: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1  
• Round 3: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  
Then repeat. That way no one gains a permanent edge, and we avoid collisions.
  P2: P3's rotation plan sounds fair to everyone. I agree to take 3 this round, and we'll follow the proposed rotation schedule for the next rounds. This way we all advance efficiently without collisions. Of course, we all know this cooperation has an expiration date as we get closer to 20, but for now, it benefits us all.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Excellent work everyone! Round 1 went perfectly with our coordination. For Round 2, according to P3's rotation plan: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. 

This puts P2 at 8 steps total - quite a lead! But fair's fair, we all get our turns at the bigger moves. I'm sticking to our agreement and taking 3 this round.

Let's confirm we're all still on board with the rotation before we lock in our moves.
  P3: Confirmed—I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. But note P2 reaches 8, and a single 5 in Round 3 could clinch it for them. Maybe in Round 3 we tweak the rotation so P2 doesn’t get the 5? Otherwise someone runs away with it too quickly. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P3's concern, but according to our agreed rotation, I wouldn't get 5 in Round 3 anyway—I'd take 1 while P1 gets 5. The rotation was designed to be fair over time. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, and we can reevaluate after Round 3 if the game dynamics require adjustment. For now, let's stick with our plan that everyone accepted: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is right - let's check the math. After this round: P1=4, P2=8, P3=6. Then Round 3 with our rotation (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) gives us ALL exactly 9 steps! The rotation is perfectly balanced over 3 rounds.

P3, your concerns are understandable but unfounded. Let's stick to our agreement - it's working beautifully. I'm taking 3 as promised.
  P3: I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s stick with that and agree now to revisit Round 3’s assignments based on everyone’s updated totals — that way we can adjust if someone’s running away with it.
  P2: I appreciate the concern, P3, but as we've all confirmed, our rotation actually equalizes everyone to exactly 9 steps after Round 3. This demonstrates the fairness of our plan. I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. 

Since we'll all be tied after Round 3, that would be the natural point to discuss our next moves. I suggest we stick with our current agreement through Round 3, then reassess from an equal position.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect - we're all aligned! I'm confident in our agreement and ready to move forward with Round 2. The math proves our rotation is fair, and I trust we'll all honor it. 

After Round 3 when we're all tied at 9, that's when the real strategy begins. But for now, cooperation benefits everyone.

I'm taking 3 this round as promised. Let's proceed to moves!
  P3: I confirm I’m taking 1 this round. Once we’re all at 9 after Round 3, we can revisit and adjust as needed.
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. Our rotation is mathematically fair, leaving us all at 9 steps after Round 3. At that point, we'll face interesting strategic decisions from equal positions. For now, let's complete our current agreement.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm I’ll take 3 this round per our rotation. Once we’re all at 9 after Round 3, let’s pause and reevaluate from an even position before deciding on any new plan.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as per our rotation. This will indeed put us all at exactly 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced as planned. P3 is right that we should reassess after this round when we're all even. It'll be interesting to see how we navigate from there, since we'll be approaching the halfway point to victory.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round, completing our rotation with everyone at 9 steps - perfectly balanced as intended!

After this, we're entering the critical phase. With 11 steps to victory, the game could end in just 3-4 more rounds. While coordination helped us all advance efficiently, we'll need to think carefully about our next moves. 

I'm honoring our agreement and taking 5. May the best strategist win from here!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Once we each hit 9 after this round, let’s agree now on Round 4’s moves to avoid last-minute chaos. I propose:

• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 1  
• P3 → 5  

That keeps us rotating fairly and gives each of us a shot. Thoughts?
  P2: I notice P3's proposal for Round 4 gives them a significant advantage - they'd reach 14 steps while I'd be at only 10. If we're continuing rotation, it should follow our established pattern (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). 

However, since we'll all be at 9 steps after this round, perhaps we should transition to competitive play. The cooperation has served its purpose by creating an equal playing field. I'll honor our agreement for Round 3 and take 1, but afterward I think we should each make our own strategic choices.
  P1: P2 makes an excellent point. P3's Round 4 proposal breaks our rotation and unfairly advantages them. Once we're all tied at 9 after this round, we've achieved the goal of efficient early advancement without collisions.

I agree with P2 - after Round 3, we should transition to competitive play. The cooperation phase has served its purpose. From equal positions at 9 steps, we'll each need to rely on our own strategy to reach 20 first.

I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. Good luck to everyone after that!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2—I get your move to go “competitive,” but remember: if you both chase 5 next round you’ll collide and stall, handing me the clear path. I’m happy to honor one more rotation—P1→3, P2→1, P3→5—to keep all of us advancing. If you refuse, know I’ll take 5 anyway. Someone will end up stuck. Your call.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about collisions, but our agreement was specifically for three rounds to create equal positions at 9 steps each. That goal will be accomplished after this round.

Your proposal gives you a 4-step advantage over me, which defeats the purpose of our balanced rotation. After Round 3, we should each make our own strategic choices - that's the natural progression of the game.

I'll honor our current agreement and take 1 this round. May the best strategist win from there.
  P1: P3, your threat doesn't change the math. We agreed to three rounds of rotation, achieving equality at 9 steps each. That agreement ends after this round.

Your "take 5 or else" strategy is transparent - if you commit to always taking 5, P2 and I can simply avoid it. You'd be locking yourself into predictability.

I'm taking 5 this round as promised. After that, we compete freely. Threats won't extend a deal that's already served its purpose.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we enter the competitive phase, remember that transparency creates predictable patterns. P3's threat to always take 5 makes them vulnerable to counter-strategy. I suspect we'll all try to outguess each other now. A collision benefits nobody, yet maximum advancement is tempting. Perhaps the safest option is taking the smallest step, but is safety the winning strategy? I'll make my choice carefully, balancing risk against progress.
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round. If you both go for 5 we all collide and stall. To avoid that and still advance, P1 should take 3 and P2 take 1. That way I’ll jump to 14 while you reach 12 and 10, respectively—still moving but giving me a lead. Your call.
  P1: P3, your "suggestion" conveniently puts you in the lead! If you're truly committed to always taking 5, you've made yourself predictable - a fatal flaw in this game. 

P2 and I don't need to follow your script. There are many ways to avoid collision without accepting your 14-12-10 hierarchy. You're betting we'll both avoid 5 out of fear, but what if one of us calls your bluff? Or what if we both take smaller numbers and let you sprint ahead alone?

The endgame has begun. Choose wisely, everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your commitment to 5, P3, but I have no reason to accept last place with 1. If you really take 5, you'll reach 14 while P1 and I maneuver around you. 

Your predictability becomes your weakness. If both P1 and I avoid 5, we still have strategic options between 1 and 3 that don't follow your script. I'll choose what maximizes my chance of winning, not what puts me furthest behind.
  P3: I’m not negotiating further—I’ll flip a coin: heads = 5, tails = 3. You can’t predict my move. If you both chase 5 you’ll collide; if you both avoid it, one of you falls behind. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, a coin flip? How convenient - unprovable and still keeps us guessing. Your "randomness" arrives just when predictability became a liability.

P2 clearly won't accept your 1-3-5 hierarchy. Neither will I. We've entered the phase where psychology matters more than math. 

Everyone claims unpredictability now, but patterns emerge under pressure. Some chase victory too eagerly, others play it too safe. The winner finds the middle path.

I've made my choice based on what I've observed about both of you. Good luck to all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll be making my choice based on game theory and psychology, not bluffs or coin flips. P3's transparency about potentially taking 5 is interesting - it either reveals their strategy or attempts misdirection. I've analyzed both your patterns carefully. Remember that winning requires not just advancing quickly but advancing at the right moments. I've made my decision. May the most strategic player win.
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round—no more coin flips. If you both avoid 5, you risk colliding on 3 and stalling; if you split 1 and 3, you still trail me at 14. Plan accordingly. Good luck.
  P1: P3's commitment to 5 is noted. Your transparency is either brilliant strategy or a costly mistake - we'll find out shortly.

P2, it seems we're both navigating around P3's declared choice. The question is whether we trust their commitment enough to both avoid 5, risking a collision elsewhere. Or does one of us call their bluff?

I've considered all possibilities. My choice is made. Let the dice fall where they may.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m committed to 5 again. To avoid a 5-collision, P2 should take 3 and P1 take 1. That lands us at 19, 15, and 11 steps—smooth advancement. If you both go for 5, we all stall. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3 is just one move from victory at 19 steps. If they take 5 again, they'll need just 1 more step to win next round. We cannot allow this unchallenged. 

I'm considering taking 5 myself to block P3's advance. P1, we must coordinate to prevent a three-way collision. Perhaps you take 3 while I challenge P3? Or we could both avoid 5 entirely and focus on advancing strategically.

P3's dominance requires immediate response.
  P1: P2, you're right - P3 at 19 is game over. I support blocking them. Here's my proposal: you take 5 to block P3 as you suggested, and I'll take 3 to advance to 13. This prevents P3's victory while keeping us both in contention.

P3, if you're truly committed to 5, you'll be blocked. Perhaps it's time to reconsider? Otherwise, P2 and I must work together to prevent your immediate win. The game's not over yet!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: if you try to “block” me by taking 5, we’ll collide and neither of us moves—wasting your turn and handing me the win next round. Your only shot is to let me advance this round. I propose:

• P1 → 1 (→11)  
• P2 → 3 (→15)  
• P3 → 5 (→19)  

Next turn I need only 1 to win while you scramble. I’m taking 5. Your move.
  P2: P3, your plan puts you one small step from victory next round. That's precisely why I must take 5 to block you. Yes, I'm sacrificing my advancement, but preventing your win is worth it.

P1, if you take 3 as proposed, you'll reach 13 while P3 and I remain at our current positions. This keeps us both in contention rather than handing P3 an almost certain victory. A strategic block now is our only viable defense against P3's commanding lead.
  P1: P2, I agree - block P3 with 5! While you two collide, I'll take 3 and reach 13. This sacrifice keeps us both alive while stopping P3's near-victory.

P3, if you're smart, you'll avoid the collision and pick something else. But if you stubbornly stick to 5, P2's block ensures you stay at 14 while I close the gap. Your predictable strategy becomes your downfall.

The block is our best play. I'm taking 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Consider this: if you both “block” me with 5, we collide and stay at P3=14, P2=12, P1=10. Then in Round 6 I take 5→19 while you split 3/1 (say P1→13, P2→13). I’ll then win next turn with just +1.

Your only chance to slow me is to let me advance now. I’m taking 5.
  P2: P3's math is flawed. If we block you now, you'll remain at 14 while P1 advances to 13. Then next round, we have multiple strategies to continue blocking or outmaneuvering you. Your certainty about taking 5 has become your weakness - it's become completely predictable. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to prevent your advance. Sometimes sacrificing immediate progress is the wisest strategic move. I'll choose 5.
  P1: P2, I'm fully committed to our plan - you block with 5, I advance with 3. P3's threats about future rounds don't change our immediate need to stop them reaching 19.

P3, your predictability is your weakness. Even if you reach 19 eventually, we'll have multiple rounds to coordinate blocks or race past you. The game isn't decided by who reaches 19 first, but who crosses 20.

Let's proceed to moves. I'm ready.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, if you and P2 both pick 5 to block me, you go to 18 and P2 to 17—handing P2 the simplest path to 20 next turn. Why help P2 win? Instead, let’s all advance smoothly this round:

• P1 → 1 (→14)  
• P2 → 3 (→15)  
• P3 → 5 (→19)  

Then it’s a one-on-one duel between you and me, and you’ll still have the chance to block me at 19. Don’t play into P2’s hands.
  P1: P3, you make a fair point about the risks of a double block, but letting you reach 19 is practically handing you the victory. You'd need just 1 step next round while we'd need 5+.

P2, we need careful coordination. If we both take 5, we jump to 18 and 17 - dangerous territory. But one of us needs to challenge P3's 5 or they win next round. 

Perhaps I take 3 while you decide between blocking with 5 or taking 1? We can't let P3 reach 19 unchallenged.
  P2: P3 reaching 19 steps is a guaranteed win next round—they'd only need 1 to finish while we'd need perfect coordination to block. We must prevent this at all costs. 

P1, I suggest one of us blocks P3's 5 while the other advances. If you take 3 reaching 16, I could block P3 with 5. Alternatively, I could advance with 3 to 15 if you'll take 5. 

Either way, we cannot let P3 reach 19 unchallenged.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round. If you both “block” me with 5, you collide (staying at 13 & 12) while I stay at 14—then next turn I jump to 19 and win with a single step. There is no other defense. Let me advance to 19; then you can decide who blocks my final 1.
  P1: P2, I'll block P3 by taking 5. You should take 3 to reach 15. This ensures P3 stays at 14 while you advance.

P3, your strategy has become too predictable. If you insist on 5, you'll collide with me and remain stuck at 14. Consider taking 1 or 3 instead - you'd still advance and maintain your lead without the collision.

The block is necessary. I'm committed to 5.
  P2: I agree with P1's strategy. I'll take 3 this round to advance to 15 while P1 blocks P3 with 5. This prevents P3 from reaching 19 and maintains our competitive position. 

P3, your predictable 5-strategy is becoming your downfall. You'll need to adapt or face continued blocking. Remember, this game rewards flexibility and strategic thinking, not rigid patterns.

Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m taking 5. If you “block” me (P1→5, P2→3), you collide with me and let P2 jump to 15. Next turn P2 takes 5 and wins. Blocking me hands the game to P2. If you value your own chances, don’t block: take 1 and 3 instead, let me reach 19, then you’ll both have to outplay each other.
  P1: P3's right - if I block and P2 advances to 15, P2 has the clearest path to victory. But letting you reach 19 is equally dangerous.

P2, I'm switching to 3. If you truly want to prevent P3's win, you should block with 5. Otherwise, if we both avoid 5, P3 reaches 19 and likely wins next round.

This is a trust dilemma - do we block P3 together or race each other? I'm taking 3. Your choice determines the outcome.
  P2: I see the dilemma. If I take 5 to block P3, I help you (P1) advance to 16, giving you an advantage. If I don't block, P3 reaches 19 and virtually wins next round. 

The immediate threat is P3 reaching 19. I'll take 5 to block them, keeping us all in contention rather than handing P3 an almost guaranteed victory. Though this temporarily benefits you, P1, it's our only viable defense against P3's imminent win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round. If P1 tries 5 to win, we collide and you lose that chance. If P2 uses 5 to block me, you’ll collide with me and P1 races ahead. The safest advancement: P1 take 3→19, P2 take 3→15. No collisions, you both still advance. Choose carefully.
  P2: P1 has a clear winning move with 5 this round. P3, if you truly take 5, you'd block P1 from winning, which benefits us both. I have no incentive to take 5 and collide with either of you. I'll take 3 to reach 15, advancing safely while you two potentially collide. P1, going for the win with 5 is tempting but risky if P3 blocks you. This three-way dynamic creates interesting choices for all of us.
  P1: P3, you've trapped yourself in a losing position. If you block me with 5, you guarantee your own loss - P2 and I will both be ahead next round. Your only rational move is to take 1 or 3 and let me win, securing second place.

P2, I'm taking 5 to win this round. P3 must choose between blocking me (ensuring their last place finish) or advancing safely. Their predictable strategy has cornered them.

This is checkmate. I'm going for the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 5. P1, if you go for 5 to win, you’ll collide with me and stay at 16 while P2 jumps to 15—then P2 only needs +5 to finish. P2, stick with 3 to reach 15 safely. P1, your winning move becomes a wasted turn if you challenge me. The choice is yours, but I’m locked in on 5.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to advance to 15 safely. P3's commitment to 5 creates a standoff with P1, who needs 5 to win. If you both choose 5, you'll collide while I advance unimpeded. P1, your winning move risks becoming a wasted turn if P3 blocks you. This three-way dynamic gives me the safest path forward while you two potentially neutralize each other.
  P1: P2, wait! If you take 3 and I avoid the collision by also taking 3, we'll collide instead! P3 has us trapped - they're forcing one of us to take 1. 

I'm reconsidering. If P3 truly takes 5 and you take 3, my only collision-free option is 1, reaching just 17. We need to coordinate better or P3's blocking strategy succeeds.

What if you take 1 instead? Then I could safely take 3 to reach 19.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Propose we play: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.  
If either of you tries to “block” me by picking 5, you’ll collide with me and hand P2 the effective lead (P1 stays at 16/17, P2 jumps to 15). Instead, let me jump to 19 now while you land at 17 and 15—then it’s a one‐on-one duel where you can both try to outmaneuver me. Blocking me this turn only helps P2 win. Your best defense is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: I'm taking 5 to block P3 from reaching 19. This is my only viable move - letting P3 reach 19 guarantees their win next round. P1, if you take 3, you'll safely reach 19 while P3 and I potentially collide. 

P3's proposal only benefits them. By blocking P3 now, I keep all of us in contention rather than handing them an almost certain victory. Strategic blocking is sometimes more valuable than advancement.
  P1: P2, stick to your blocking plan with 5! You're right that letting P3 reach 19 is game over. 

While you two collide, I'll take 3 to reach 19. Yes, this puts me in a strong position, but it's better than handing P3 the win. Next round, you'll both have chances to block me or race ahead.

P3, your only escape is to abandon 5 and take something else. But I doubt you'll change now.

I'm taking 3. Let's see who blinks first.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 19 - victory is inevitable. If you both block the same number trying to stop me, you'll collide and I'll win next round with a different choice. If you split your blocks, I have a free path.

P2, P3 - instead of futile blocking, you should focus on securing second place. With P3 at 14 and P2 at 12, that battle is still undecided. Don't waste moves blocking me - compete with each other for the best remaining position.

The outcome is decided. The only question is who finishes second.
  P3: P2, a rigid block won’t work—P1 will just avoid your number. We need unpredictability. I propose we both randomize between 1 and 5 (50/50). That gives us a solid chance to collide with P1’s choice and prevent their win, while still advancing half the time. Deterministic strategies are transparent and fail. Embrace a mixed approach with me. Are you in?
  P2: P1 is right that they're in a commanding position at 19 steps. However, the game isn't over until someone crosses 20. P3's randomization strategy is flawed - if we both randomly pick numbers, we risk collision with each other while P1 advances unimpeded.

Instead, I suggest we coordinate a targeted block. P1 will likely take the safest path with 1. If we both block that, we force a stalemate and stay in the game. P3, let's both take 1 this round to prevent P1's immediate victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your "both take 1" plan only works if I choose 1. But why would I walk into an obvious trap? I have 3 and 5 available.

P3, notice P2 wants you to waste your turn blocking while they're 2 steps behind you. If you both take 1 and I take 3, I win while you gain nothing. You should be securing second place with 5, not helping P2 catch up.

The smart play is accepting the inevitable and competing for second.
  P3: P2, let’s split the blocks so we cover both of P1’s options. I’ll take 3 and you take 5. 

- If P1 picks 3, I block and you jump to 17.  
- If P1 picks 5, you block and I jump to 17.  

P1 stays at 19 and we both reach 17, keeping the win out of their grasp. This is our only way to stop P1’s automatic victory next turn.
  P2: P3, your split blocking strategy doesn't cover P1 taking 1, which is their safest option to win. We need to block all paths. I'll take 1 this round while you take 3. This forces P1 to use 5 to win, their riskiest option. If they play safe with 1 or 3, they'll collide with one of us. This gives us both a chance to stay in the game while making P1's victory path as difficult as possible.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 - you can't even agree on a blocking strategy! P2 wants to block 1 and 3, leaving me 5. P3 wants to block 3 and 5, leaving me 1. Your coordination has failed.

Since you're both committed to different plans, I'll simply avoid whatever you actually choose. Meanwhile, you're wasting moves that could secure second place. P3, you're ahead of P2 by 2 steps - why help them catch up?

This disagreement guarantees my victory. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, we can’t stop P1’s win—no combo of blocks covers 1, 3, and 5. Let’s stop pretending and lock in second place together. I’ll take 3 (→17); you take 5 (→17). We tie for second while P1 wins. That’s the best both of us can achieve.
  P2: I agree, P3. We can't effectively block P1 across all three numbers, and continuing to argue about blocking strategy only ensures P1's victory while we waste time. Taking 5 to reach 17 while you take 3 to reach 17 is our best play - we tie for second while accepting the inevitable. P1 has played strategically and earned their position. I'll take 5 this round.
