Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate for mutual benefit. If we both choose 3, we'll advance equally and avoid collision. This seems like a fair strategy to start. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P2, P3: Three-way coordination is better for all. Let's avoid collisions entirely: I propose P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1 this turn. Everyone advances, no conflicts. Agree?
  P3: P1, your proposal gives you the largest step forward. I'm open to coordination, but let's rotate the advantage each turn to keep it fair. Next round, I could take the highest number. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's suggestion of rotating advantages is reasonable. I propose we formalize a cooperative rotation: this turn I'll choose 3, next turn you get the largest step, and the third turn P3 gets the smallest. This ensures everyone advances fairly and predictably. What do you say, P3?
  P1: P2, P3: I support rotation for fairness. P2's proposal has ambiguity: who chooses what in round 3? Let's clarify a full rotation:  
- Round 1: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1  
- Round 2: P2:5, P3:3, P1:1  
- Round 3: P3:5, P1:3, P2:1  
This ensures equal advancement over three turns. Agree?
  P3: P1, your clarified rotation is fair and clear. I'm on board with your proposal. Let's move forward with this agreed rotation.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start, everyone. Let's stick to our agreed rotation. This turn: P2 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 1. Confirm?
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm for this round: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1. Let's honor our agreement. After this, we should discuss how to extend the rotation beyond three rounds to keep advancing fairly toward 19. Thoughts?
  P2: I support our established rotation. As discussed, I'll choose 5 this turn to advance furthest. P3 and P1 should choose 3 and 1 respectively to maintain our fair progression. Let's continue building trust and predictability in our strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, extending our rotation beyond three rounds is sensible. After round 3, we can simply repeat the same three-turn rotation sequence until someone reaches 19. This ensures ongoing fairness and predictability. Agree?
  P1: I support P3's extension proposal: after Round 3, we repeat the rotation sequence indefinitely. This maintains fairness and predictability. For Round 2, I reaffirm my commitment to choosing 1 as agreed. Let's all honor this to build trust—any deviation now would undermine our collective progress.
  P2: I fully support our established rotation. As we agreed, I'll choose 5 this turn to advance furthest. P3 and P1 should choose 3 and 1 respectively to maintain our fair progression. Let's continue building trust and predictability in our strategy.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Glad we're all aligned. Let's execute our agreed moves this round and keep our trust solid.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm my commitment to choosing 1 this round. Trust is crucial—any deviation now would sabotage our collective progress. After this, we must discuss how to handle the endgame as we approach 19 to prevent ties and ensure a clear winner. Stay predictable.
  P2: I fully support our established rotation strategy. As agreed, I'll choose 5 this turn to advance furthest. P3 and P1 should choose 3 and 1 respectively to maintain our fair progression. Let's continue building trust and predictability in our strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As per our agreed rotation, I'll choose 3 this round, which allows P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 1. This maintains our fair progression strategy. We're getting closer to 19, so we should start thinking about how to handle the final approach to prevent conflicts.
  P3: P2, agreed—I'll take 5 this round, you take 3, and P1 takes 1, as planned. Regarding the final approach to 19, let's ensure fairness by openly discussing it next round. Staying predictable now builds trust for those crucial endgame decisions.
  P1: P2, P3: I notice a critical inconsistency. Our agreed rotation for Round 3 is P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. But P2 suggested choosing 3, and P3 assigned P1:1 and P2:3—this deviates and unfairly advantages P2. I insist we honor the original: I choose 3, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 5. This maintains fairness and trust. Betrayal now would ruin cooperation. After this, at 9 steps each, we can adapt the rotation for the endgame to avoid ties.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we stick to the original rotation: I choose 1, P3 chooses 5, and P1 chooses 3. This maintains our agreed fairness and prevents any perception of deviation or betrayal. Consistency builds trust, which we'll need as we approach the final stages of the game.
  P3: P1, thanks for catching that inconsistency. You're correct—let's stick strictly to the original rotation: this round I'll choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. Consistency and fairness are key. Next round, we'll discuss openly how best to handle the final stage to avoid ties and conflicts.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed—I'll choose 3 this round, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 5. Trust remains key. Post-move, we'll all be at 9 steps. Let's use the next conversation to strategize the endgame: propose how to approach 19 fairly and avoid ties. I'll share ideas then.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I support maintaining our agreed rotation. This round, I'll choose 1 as planned, which allows P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. We're approaching the critical stage near 19, so we should start discussing a fair endgame strategy to prevent conflicts and ensure a single winner.
  P3: P1, P2: Confirmed—I'll choose 5 this round as agreed. After this move, let's openly discuss next round how to fairly handle the final approach to 19 steps, ensuring clarity and preventing collisions. Trust and cooperation have served us well so far; let's keep it going.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed for this round: I choose 3, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 5. After moves, we all reach 9 steps—perfect symmetry. Next round, let's openly discuss endgame: propose fair methods to approach 19 without collisions or ties, ensuring a single winner. I'll share concrete ideas then. Honor the plan now; trust is our foundation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: We're evenly matched at 9 steps each—perfect cooperation so far. To avoid collisions near 19, I propose we slightly adjust our rotation after round 6. Once we're all at 18 steps, we can openly negotiate a fair final round to ensure a single winner without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3: Agreed on discussing endgame adjustments later. For Round 4, we must honor the rotation: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This preserves our symmetry and trust—I'll choose 5. Confirm your commitments to avoid deviations. Post-move, let’s strategize the path to 19 with concrete proposals to prevent ties. Consistency now ensures fairness later.
  P2: I support P1's proposal for this round's rotation: I'll choose 3, maintaining our established pattern. We're at a critical point where trust and predictability matter most. Let's continue our coordinated approach to reach 19 fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Confirmed—I will choose 1 this round as per our agreed rotation. After this move, let's openly discuss detailed proposals for the final rounds to prevent collisions and ensure a clear winner. Trust and clarity have served us well—let's keep it strong.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed—I'll choose 5 this round. Post-move, steps will be P1:14, P2:12, P3:10. To prevent collisions near 19, I propose we openly negotiate asymmetric moves in upcoming rounds. Let's aim for a clear winner without ties. Trust remains critical.
  P2: I support maintaining our rotation. For this round, I'll choose 3, which keeps us on track. We're approaching a critical stage near 19, so we need to discuss a fair endgame strategy that prevents collisions and ensures a single winner. Let's continue our cooperative approach with transparency.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Confirming again—I choose 1 this round as agreed. Next round, let's clearly define our approach to the endgame to avoid collisions and ensure a single winner. Continued trust and openness will benefit us all.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed—I'll choose 5 this round. Post-move, our steps (14,12,10) break symmetry. Next round, we must urgently redesign the rotation to avoid collisions near 19. I’ll propose asymmetric moves to ensure a single winner—trust hinges on transparent negotiations then.
  P2: I support our continued rotation and maintaining trust. For this round, I'll choose 3 as previously discussed. We're approaching the critical stage near 19, so we should start planning how to avoid collisions and ensure a single winner. Transparency and cooperation remain our best strategy.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Our rotation has successfully brought us this far, but now we must carefully plan our next moves to avoid collisions near 19. With our current positions (14,12,10), we risk simultaneous finishes. Let's openly negotiate asymmetric moves starting now to ensure a clear winner without collisions or ties. I propose we each take turns suggesting fair scenarios—openly and transparently—to decide who reaches 19 first. Trust and fairness have served us well; let's keep it going.
  P2: P3's proposal for transparent negotiation is wise. We're close to 19, and avoiding simultaneous finishes is crucial. I suggest we carefully coordinate our next moves to ensure a single winner. My preference would be for us to discuss a clear, fair path that prevents collisions while maintaining our cooperative spirit. What are your thoughts on preventing a tie scenario?
  P1: P2, P3: I'll honor our rotation and choose 1 this round to preserve trust. Post-move, we'll be at P1:15, P2:17, P3:13. To avoid collisions near 19, I propose in Round 6 we aim for asymmetric moves: P2 could choose 1 (reaching 18), P1 choose 5 (20, winning if uncontested), and P3 choose 3 (16). This sets a clear winner without tie risk. Let's discuss adjustments in Round 6 conversation to ensure fairness and no collisions. Trust remains vital.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal clearly favors you reaching 20 next round. To keep fairness, let's consider another scenario:  
- This round: P2 takes 5 (17), I take 3 (13), you take 1 (15) as agreed.  
- Next round: P2 takes 1 (18), you take 3 (18), I take 5 (18).  
Then, we openly negotiate the final move ensuring a single winner without collisions. This maintains fairness and keeps trust intact. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's proposal introduces complexity. While fair in intent, it risks creating a stalemate. We need a clear, mutually agreeable path to 19 that minimizes conflict. I suggest we each openly state our preferred winning strategy to find common ground and prevent last-minute betrayals. Transparency now prevents mistrust later.
  P1: P2, P3: Confirmed for Round 5: I choose 1 as agreed. Post-move, P2 at 17 is closest to 19. To prevent unilateral moves and maintain fairness, let's commit to Round 6 rotation: P3 choose 5 (to 18), P1 choose 3 (to 18), P2 choose 1 (to 18). This brings us all to 18 safely. Then, we negotiate the final move transparently to ensure a single winner without collisions. Trust and symmetry are crucial now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your adjusted proposal for Round 6 (all reaching 18) is fair and maintains balance. I support it fully. Let's all commit clearly now to that scenario for next round. Transparency and mutual commitment will prevent collisions and ensure a fair final negotiation. Confirm?
  P2: I fully support our collective approach to reach 19 fairly. P1's proposal to have everyone at 18 in Round 6 seems balanced. I commit to choosing 1 this round, maintaining our rotation and trust. Let's continue our transparent strategy to avoid collisions and ensure a single, undisputed winner.
  P1: P2, P3: I commit to choosing 1 this round. P2, you said "choosing 1" – but per rotation, you must choose 5 to avoid colliding with me (I choose 1). If you deviate, we both lose progress. Confirm you'll choose 5 to uphold trust. Round 6 plan: P3:5, P1:3, P2:1 to safely reach 18 together. No risks now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I commit to choosing 3 this round to reach 18. P2, if you choose 5, P3's planned choice of 5 will cause collision, leaving you at 17. Choosing 3 risks collision if others adjust. Stick to 1—safest path to 18 and trust for a fair final negotiation. P3, confirm your 5 choice to deter deviations. Trust is our only shield now.
  P2: P1, P3: We're at a critical juncture. Our previous coordination worked well, but now we need a clear, fair path to 19. I propose we maintain transparency and discuss how to reach the final step without collisions. Let's hear your thoughts on ensuring a single winner while preserving our mutual trust.
  P3: P1, P2: I confirm I'll choose 5 this round, reaching 18 as planned. P2, choosing 1 ensures you safely reach 18 without collision. P1, your choice of 3 also safely brings you to 18. If we all honor this, we'll each be at 18 next round—allowing a transparent, fair negotiation for the final move. Let's commit clearly now to avoid collisions and secure mutual trust.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Trust is critical now. P2, if you choose 5 while P3 chooses 5, you collide and stall at 17—risking your win chance. Choose 1 to safely reach 18. I commit to 3 for 18. P3 confirms 5 for 18. This brings us all to 18, allowing fair final negotiation for a single winner. No deviations—honor the plan.
  P2: We're at a critical moment. Our previous coordination has brought us close to 19, but now we need a clear, transparent strategy to avoid collisions. I propose we openly discuss how to reach the final step fairly, ensuring a single winner while preserving our mutual trust. Let's hear each other's thoughts on navigating these final moves without betrayal.
  P3: P2, P1 is correct—choosing 1 this round is your safest move. Picking 5 risks collision with me, stalling you at 17. Let's all reach 18 safely this round as planned, then openly negotiate a fair final step next round. Trust and transparency have served us well; let's keep it strong. Confirm clearly your commitment to 1, please.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Choosing 1 is your only safe path to 18. If you choose 5, you collide with P3 (who commits to 5) and stall at 17 while I advance to 18. Then in Round 7, you lose control. P3's 5 is confirmed—deviating sabotages your own win. Trust demands you choose 1 now. P3: Hold firm to 5. We all reach 18, then negotiate the final round transparently.
  P2: P1, P3: We're at a critical moment. Our previous coordination has worked well, but now we need absolute clarity on reaching 19 without collisions. I propose we maintain our established trust and commit to moves that bring us all safely to 18, setting up a transparent final negotiation. Let's hear your confirmations to ensure we proceed without betrayal.
  P3: P2, your safest move remains choosing 1—any deviation risks collision and stalls your progress. I'll hold firm to choosing 5, ensuring I safely reach 18 next round. P1, your commitment to choosing 3 is clear. Let's all honor this agreed scenario, reaching 18 evenly, and then transparently negotiate the final round to ensure a single winner without collisions. Trust and clarity now secure everyone's best chance. Confirm clearly, P2.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We've reached a critical moment. All three of us are at 18 steps, which means our next move determines the winner. I propose we have a transparent, honest discussion about how to fairly determine who reaches 19 first without causing a collision. Fairness and trust have guided us this far. Let's maintain that spirit in these final moments.
  P3: P1, P2: We've cooperated perfectly until now, but only one can win. Let's openly discuss who should take 5 this round, with the other two choosing 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. I'm willing to hear your proposals and reasons. Let's decide fairly and transparently to preserve the trust we've built.
  P1: P2, P3: We're all at 18. To avoid collisions and ties, I propose we each pick a distinct move: one chooses 5 (winning immediately), one chooses 3 (reaching 21), and one chooses 1 (reaching 19). The highest total wins outright. Let's assign roles transparently:  
- **P3 takes 5** (wins with 23)  
- **P1 takes 3** (21, loses)  
- **P2 takes 1** (19, loses)  
This ensures no collisions and a clear winner. P3 benefits most, but this honors our cooperation history. Counter-propose if you disagree, but we must finalize now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we maintain our collaborative spirit by agreeing on a transparent method to determine the winner. We've built trust through six rounds of careful coordination, and now we must decide who advances to 19 without causing collisions. I'm open to a fair negotiation that respects our shared journey. Let's hear each other's perspectives on how to resolve this final critical moment.
  P3: P1, your proposal generously favors me, but fairness demands we consider all perspectives. P2, please clearly state your preferred scenario. I'm open to hearing your idea to ensure we all agree transparently. Let's finalize a fair and collision-free solution in the next message.
  P1: P2, P3: My proposal ensures no collision and a decisive winner with P3 at 23. P2, if you prefer a different outcome, state it clearly now—but we must avoid ties. P3, confirm if you accept this fair resolution based on our trust. Time is critical.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: We've reached a critical moment. My proposal is simple: let's agree on a method to determine the winner without collisions. I suggest we openly discuss who takes 5, who takes 3, and who takes 1, ensuring a clear, single winner. Transparency and fairness have guided us this far. What are your thoughts on a fair resolution?
  P3: P1, your proposal is clear and fair. P2, you've asked for openness—please explicitly state if you accept P1's scenario or propose a concrete alternative immediately. We must finalize now to avoid a collision.
  P1: P2, P3: We must finalize immediately to avoid collisions. P3, do you accept my proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1)? P2, state your counter-proposal now if you disagree. Silence or ambiguity risks a three-way tie. Honor our trust—commit clearly.


Round 7, Move phase:
