Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: Let's avoid early collisions—how about we all pick different numbers this round? I’ll take 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Fair start for everyone?
  P3: Okay P2, that could work. What does P1 say? If P1 agrees to 1, I'm good with 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’d prefer a balanced rotation: each round we cycle (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) → (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1) → (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5), then repeat. Everyone gets each number equally and no one falls behind. Sound fair?
  P2: P1, your rotation idea is fair long-term, but maybe for this first round we just stick with my proposal to avoid early collisions. Then we can move into your rotation from Round 2 onward. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand wanting a fair rotation long-term. P2's suggestion to use their plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) just for this first round seems like a simple way to avoid collision and get started. We can definitely discuss your rotation system for Round 2 onwards. Does that work for you for now?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s kick the rotation off immediately so the pattern stays clean:

• Round 1: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  
• Round 2: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
• Round 3: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  

Then repeat. Everyone gets a 5 early, nobody collides, and the cycle is easy to track. Sound good?
  P2: Alright, P1, your rotation plan is structured and fair—I'm on board. Let's go with your Round 1 setup: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Looking forward to seeing how well we can keep this cycle going.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I agree to the plan for Round 1: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Let's execute this and see how the rotation works out in the next rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the agreed rotation, this round should be: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Let’s keep it clean and build trust—no collisions helps us all stay in the game competitively. Agreed?
  P3: Yes P2, I agree. Let's stick to the rotation for this round: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Consistency is good for now. What does P1 say?
  P1: Agreed—sticking to the rotation: I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. No collisions keeps everyone moving and the pattern simple. Ready to execute.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we’re all aligned. Let’s keep this rotation smooth—no surprises, no collisions. Trust builds momentum. Ready to move forward with P2 = 5 this round.
  P3: Okay P2, sounds like we are all set on the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready to proceed with 1. Let's keep it smooth.
  P1: All good—let’s stick to the rotation as planned: this round I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. After we finish the first full 3-round cycle (everyone having 5-3-1 once), we can pause and see if any tweaks help us avoid collisions as scores diverge. For now, smooth sailing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock it in then—P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1 for this round. After Round 3, we’ll each have had one of each move, and can reassess based on standings. So far, this rotation is working well—no collisions, steady progress. Let’s keep that momentum.
  P3: Okay, we all seem firmly agreed on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready to proceed with 1. Let's lock it in.
  P1: All good—let’s lock in the rotation this round: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. After Round 3 we’ll review standings and consider tweaks if needed. Ready for moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to our cycle: this round I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. After we all hit 9 we can reassess tactics based on who’s leading. Ready to keep it clean one more time.
  P3: Yes P1, I agree. Let's stick to the rotation for Round 3: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. This brings us all to 9 points. I will pick 5. P2, are you good with picking 3?
  P2: Yes, I’m good with 3 this round—let’s complete the rotation cleanly: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. We’ll all hit 9 and then reassess based on standings. Trust is key to avoiding collisions, so let’s finish this cycle as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked in: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. See you in the move reveal.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all locked in and ready. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: After this round, we’ll all be tied at 9 steps—perfectly even. From Round 4 onward, maybe we continue the rotation but allow flexibility if someone starts falling behind. A cooperative pattern helps us all avoid collisions while staying competitive. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked in: this round I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. After we’re all tied at 9 we can discuss whether to keep the rotation or tweak it, but for now let’s stay collision-free. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, we all seem firmly agreed and ready for the move phase. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's proceed.
  P2: Looks like we’re all set for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. After this, we’ll each be at 9 steps and can reassess. I suggest we continue the rotation for a couple more rounds to avoid chaos, but stay open to adjustments if gaps emerge. Fair?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re perfectly tied at 9, which is rare and ideal. I propose we continue the rotation for another full cycle:  
• Round 4: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  
• Round 5: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
• Round 6: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  

Keeps things fair and avoids collisions. After Round 6, we reassess based on standings. Sound good?
  P3: Yes P2, continuing the rotation seems like the fairest and safest approach while we're all tied. I agree to the plan for this round: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.

P1, are you also on board with continuing the cycle as P2 proposed?
  P1: Agreed—let’s keep the rotation clean this round: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. After Round 5 we can pause and reassess in case anyone’s pulling ahead or falling behind. Ready to roll.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, glad we’re all aligned for Round 4. Let’s stay disciplined and stick to the rotation: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. If we keep this going cleanly through Round 6, we’ll all be at 18 and still perfectly balanced. Then we can adjust based on who wants to take a shot at the win. Let’s keep building trust and avoid any surprises. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm ready to proceed with 3. Let's keep the cooperation going for now.
  P1: Sounds good: let’s run the rotation exactly as planned through Round 6 so we all reach 18 together. That keeps trust high and gives us a clean test of the system. After Round 6 we pause and reevaluate—maybe switch to a “who-ever’s trailing gets the 5” rule or something similar to keep things fair and collision-free. For now, I’m sticking with the cycle. Ready to move when you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 4 as agreed: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. We’re halfway through a second clean cycle—sticking to it gets us all to 18 with no collisions. After that, we can decide how to handle the final push to 21. Let’s keep the trust strong. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, confirmed on all sides for Round 4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Continuing the rotation until we all hit 18 seems like a solid plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions for now. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, the rotation plan for this round is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

However, this puts P1 at 17 steps, very close to winning. P2 gets a needed boost to 15, but I fall behind to 13. Is continuing this specific rotation still the best strategy for everyone who doesn't want P1 to win easily, or should we perhaps adjust now that P1 has a clear lead? What do you both think?
  P2: P3, good point—P1 is pulling ahead. If we stick to the rotation, P1 hits 17 this round, and could win in Round 6. Maybe we adjust now: let’s block P1 by both picking 3 (causing a collision), while one of us takes 5. I’m willing to take 3 and block if you want 5 this round. Thoughts?
  P1: Easy math check: if we simply keep the rotation, scores after this round will be  
• P1 17 • P2 15 • P3 13.  
Next round (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5) puts EVERYONE at 18—dead tie again. So no one is racing off yet. Colliding now only slows both blockers while giving the third player a free run next turn.  

Let’s finish the second cycle as promised, land at 18-18-18, then openly renegotiate the end-game. That keeps trust high and prevents any single player from sneaking ahead during chaos. Sticking to P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1 this round still looks best for all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your point about reaching 18-18-18 is valid *if* we follow the next two rounds perfectly. However, the immediate result of P1=17, P2=15, P3=13 leaves me significantly behind this turn.

P2, your idea to block is tempting, but risky as P1 might anticipate it.

How about a slight modification to keep things perfectly balanced *now*?
Instead of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, let's do:
**P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3**

This round's result would be P1=15, P2=15, P3=15. Everyone is perfectly tied again. This feels fairer than letting P1 get to 17 while I only get to 13. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I like your idea—it keeps us all tied at 15 and avoids giving P1 a lead. I’m on board with switching to P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 this round. It’s a fair reset and keeps trust intact. P1, will you agree to 1 this round to maintain balance?
  P1: P3, the “gap” lasts exactly one turn—Round 6 (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5) pulls you straight to 18 while I advance only 1. We’ll be dead-even at 18-18-18, with zero collisions so far and full trust intact. Shuffling now opens the door to guesses, potential double-blocks, and someone sneaking ahead in the chaos. Let’s finish the agreed cycle: this round P1 3, P2 5, P3 1. We lock in the guaranteed tie next turn and then renegotiate the sprint to 21 on equal footing. Sound reasonable?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, trusting someone to pick 1 when they are at 17 and could potentially win with 5 next round is a big ask. The original plan puts you in a very tempting position. My proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) guarantees fairness *now* by keeping us all tied at 15. P2 agrees this is safer and fairer for this round. Let's stick with the plan that maintains the tie immediately and avoids giving anyone a risky advantage.
  P2: P1, I respect consistency, but the trust only works if no one gains an edge. You’re at 14—if we follow the rotation, you hit 17 while I’m still at 15 and P3 at 13. That’s not balanced. I propose we switch this round to: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. That keeps us tied at 15 and preserves fairness. We can resume rotation after that. P3 and I are both in—will you join us to keep things even?
  P1: Stability > panic: stick to P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1 now; next round I *guarantee* to take 1 (public promise) so scores become 18-18-18. You both get your 5 before I ever could win. If I break that, feel free to double-block me afterward. Switching mid-cycle only sparks mistrust and guesswork that could let someone steal a free 5. Let’s finish the agreed rotation, lock the tie at 18, then negotiate the sprint on truly even footing.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 broke the rotation and took 3, colliding with P3. That move pushed me ahead and left P3 behind. Trust is now fractured. To restore balance, I propose:  
**P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5**  
This gives P3 a chance to catch up, me a steady 3, and P1 only 1 after causing the collision. Fair reset. If we all agree, we can still avoid chaos. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P2, I agree with your proposal: **P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5**.

P1, your move last round resulted in a collision and broke the trust we were building. This proposed move (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) actually follows the original rotation sequence you established for Round 6. It also allows me to recover the steps lost due to the collision you caused.

I will choose 5 this round. P1, will you stick to the rotation plan this time and choose 1?
  P1: Fine—I’ll take 1 this round. To avoid more mistrust, how about a clear temp rule:  
• Each round until someone reaches 20, leader takes 1, middle takes 3, trailer takes 5.  
That keeps the pack tight and collision-free, then we race from 20+.  

Right now P2 leads (15), I’m middle (14), P3 trails (12), so the mapping you suggested—P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5—fits perfectly. If we all commit, trust is rebuilt and no one can sneak a runaway lead. Sound good?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we’re aligned on P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5 this round. P1’s “leader=1, middle=3, trailer=5” rule is a smart way to keep things close and fair. I support continuing that until someone hits 20—then we race. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Ready to move forward with 3 this round.
  P3: Okay, glad we're all aligned on the moves for this round: P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. This helps restore balance after last round's collision.

P1's idea for a leader/middle/trailer rule going forward sounds like a reasonable principle to discuss for future rounds to keep things fair and avoid collisions until the final sprint. Let's lock in this round's plan first.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m taking 1 this round. Let’s adopt the rule—leader = 1, middle = 3, trailer = 5—until someone reaches 20. If players are tied, each tied player takes the lower move of the tied positions to prevent collisions (e.g., tied leaders both take 1). Ready to lock in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. This keeps things fair and follows the new leader/middle/trailer rule. I’ll take 3 this round. If we all stick to this structure, we avoid collisions and stay competitive. Once someone hits 20, we can shift to open play. Ready to move.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all firmly agreed and ready for the move phase. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's proceed.
  P1: Locked on 1 this round. Let’s stick to leader = 1, middle = 3, trailer = 5 until someone hits 20, then reassess. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Following our agreed rule: leader = 1, middle = 3, trailer = 5 — that makes this round:  
P2 (leader, 18) = 1  
P3 (middle, 17) = 3  
P1 (trailer, 15) = 5  

This keeps us all in striking distance and collision-free. Stick with it one more round, then the sprint begins at 20. Let’s keep it clean.
  P3: Okay P2, your proposed moves follow the leader/middle/trailer rule we agreed on: P2 (leader)=1, P3 (middle)=3, P1 (trailer)=5. I will stick to this plan and choose 3.

This puts P1 and me at 20, and you at 19. Importantly, the rule stated it runs "until someone reaches 20". Since P1 and I will reach 20 this round, the rule expires *after* these moves resolve. Round 8 should be open play with no predetermined moves based on position. Does everyone agree the rule ends now?
  P1: Fine by me—sticking to the rule: P2 = 1, P3 = 3, I’ll take 5. That puts scores at 20-20-19 and the leader/middle/trailer rule expires after the move reveal. We can hash out the end-game once we’re all in that position. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed—this round we stick to the rule: P2 = 1, P3 = 3, P1 = 5. That gets us to 20-20-19 and ends the structured phase cleanly. From Round 8 onward, it’s open play—no preset moves. Let’s all be mindful: any collision next round could hand the win to someone else. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be on the same page for this round: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. This sets us up for an interesting Round 8 where the structured play ends. I'm ready to proceed with 3.
  P1: 


Round 7, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we're tied at 20, P2 is right there at 19. A collision between us on 3 or 5 almost guarantees P2 wins. Maybe picking 1 is the only way to avoid handing P2 the game? Just thinking out loud. What are your thoughts?
  P2: We're all within one move of winning, so any collision hands the game to the odd one out. I propose this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. That gives each of us a fair shot next round. If we all try to win now, we risk a collision and hand it to someone else. Thoughts?
  P1: Any unique 5 wins outright, but with two players on 20 the odds of a double-5 collision are huge—handing the game to the third player. I’m not gambling; I’ll take the safe 1. Choose 3 if you want a shot without risking an instant loss, but think twice before both lunging for 5. Let’s keep the race alive for one more round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, avoiding a collision between us is the top priority, otherwise P2 wins for sure. Your claim of picking 1 prevents that direct collision.

P2, your suggestion (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) leads to my win (25). Why propose a plan where you lose? Are you trying to bait P1 and me into colliding on 5?

P1, if you genuinely pick 1, then 5 is my best move to win. But that relies entirely on trusting you won't also switch to 5. It's a risky situation for both of us.
  P2: P3, you’re right to question motives—everyone’s one move from winning, so trust is fragile. I’m sticking with 3 this round: it avoids a collision with P1 (who says 1), and blocks P3 from a solo 5 win. If P3 gambles on 5 and P1 truly picks 1, P3 wins. But if P1 or I pick 5 too, it’s game over for someone else. Let’s avoid a reckless ending—play smart, not desperate.
  P1: I’m going straight for 5 this turn. If either of you also grabs 5 we both stay put and hand the game to whoever took 3—so clash at your own peril. Pick something else if you’d rather not gift the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your sudden switch from a "safe 1" to "going straight for 5" makes this very tricky. If we both pick 5, P2 likely wins. If only one of us picks 5, that person wins. If you were bluffing about 5 and actually pick 1, then 5 is the winning move for me.

It's a high-stakes guess for both of us. P2, are you still planning on 3? Your move could decide the winner if P1 and I collide.
  P2: P1, your sudden shift to 5 is clearly a bluff or a trap—if you truly wanted to win, you'd have stayed quiet. I'm calling it: I’m picking 3. If either of you pick 5 and collide, I win. If you both avoid 5, we live to fight one more round. P3, your choice decides everything—do you trust P1’s threat or not?
  P1: I’m 100 % locked on 5. If you match me, we both stall and hand the win to P2’s 3. Play 1 or 3 if you want to stay alive—your choice.
