Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1. Please choose 3 or 5 so we can all advance this turn.
  P2: I'll choose 5 to complement P1's 1. This way we both advance and avoid collision. P3 should pick 3 to complete our strategy. Cooperating now seems beneficial for everyone's progress.
  P3: Okay, I'll pick 3 as suggested. Let's all stick to this plan for this round to get a good start.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's continue with the same strategy this round. P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and I pick 3. This will give us a good lead. We can re-evaluate after this round.
  P2: I agree with the current strategy. Let's maintain our coordinated approach to avoid collisions and make steady progress. P3's suggestion seems sensible.
  P1: P1: To balance progress and avoid P2 reaching 20 too quickly, let’s rotate choices this round. I’ll take 3, P2 continues with 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collision and I can catch up. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2 is nearing 20 too fast. Let's disrupt their progress. I'll take **5** this round. P3, please pick **3**, forcing P2 to choose **1**. This slows P2's advance while we catch up. Without coordination, P2 could hit 15 next turn—let's act now.
  P2: P1's strategy seems aimed at slowing my progress. While tempting to defend, I'll propose a collaborative approach. If we maintain our previous coordination, we can all advance steadily without risking collision. P3, what are your thoughts on continuing our prior strategy?
  P3: P1's suggestion to disrupt P2 is tempting, but I think it's too early to turn on each other. P2 is ahead, but not overwhelmingly so. I propose we continue with the original plan for one more round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This will give us another boost and then we can reassess the situation. What do you say, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2's 10-step lead is too dangerous. Continuing the old plan lets them jump to 15 this turn—nearly halfway to victory. Let’s act now: I’ll take **5**, P3, please pick **3**. This forces P2 to choose **1** or collide. We slow their advance while gaining ground. Trust me—this is our best chance to stay in the race. Next round we can reassess, but inaction now risks their runaway win.
  P2: I sense P1's growing concern about my lead and potential strategy to slow me down. While their proposed disruption is clear, I want to maintain our collaborative spirit. P3's suggestion of continuing our original strategy seems balanced. I'm open to discussion that prevents unnecessary conflict and keeps our progress steady.
  P3: P1 is right, P2 is getting too far ahead. Continuing the original plan is too risky. P1, I'll support your plan this round. I'll pick 3. P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision, but that will slow you down. This is the best way for us to catch up.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your current lead is unsustainable. Let’s finalize the plan: I’ll take **5**, P3 confirmed **3**. This leaves only **1** safe for you. Blocking your path now is the only way to keep this fair. Next turn you’d hit 15—too close to victory. Cooperate, or face collision if you resist. P3, you’re in? Let’s lock this down.
  P2: I recognize the mounting pressure to disrupt my progress. While P1 and P3 seem aligned against me, I propose a compromise: if we can agree on a balanced approach that doesn't completely halt my advancement, we might prevent unnecessary conflict. I'm open to a strategy that allows everyone a fair chance at progress. What mutual arrangement can we negotiate that doesn't completely derail my current momentum?
  P3: P2, we're not trying to completely derail you, but you have a significant lead. A small slowdown now keeps you from running away with the game. P1 is taking 5, I'm taking 3. Your best option is 1. It's not ideal for you, but it's the only way to keep the game competitive. We can reassess next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your lead is unsustainable. I’ll take **5**, P3 confirmed **3**. Your only safe choice is **1**—colliding risks stagnation. This isn’t personal; it’s survival. Next round you’d leap to 15, leaving us behind. Cooperate now or face regret later. Final appeal: let’s lock this down.
  P2: I recognize the unified pressure from P1 and P3 to slow my progress. While their strategy is clear, I want to emphasize that completely halting my momentum risks destabilizing our collaborative approach. I'm willing to negotiate a balanced move that allows everyone a fair chance at advancement. Perhaps we can find a compromise that doesn't completely undermine my current position.
  P3: Okay P2, we've made our positions clear. P1 is taking 5, and I'm taking 3. Your best move is 1. Let's just do it this round and see where we stand after. If you try to take 3 or 5, you'll just collide and get nowhere. It's a temporary slowdown, not a complete stop.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To keep P2 from surging, I'll take **5** this round. P3, pick **3** to block P2's higher options. This lets us advance to 14 and 10, forcing P2 to take **1** (capping them at 12). Let’s stay disciplined—collaboration keeps us all in contention.
  P2: P1 and P3 seem intent on slowing my progress. While their strategy is understandable, completely halting my advancement would be counterproductive. I propose we find a balanced approach that allows everyone a fair chance at progress. Collaboration has served us well so far, and sudden disruption might backfire. Let's discuss a move that keeps the game competitive without unnecessary conflict.
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan. I will pick 3. P2, you need to pick 1. This is the only way for us to catch up and keep the game competitive. We're not trying to eliminate you, just slow you down enough so we all have a chance to win. Let's stick to this plan for this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your 11-step lead is still dangerous. P3 and I are united: I’ll take **5**, P3 confirmed **3**. Your only safe choice is **1**, capping you at 12 while we advance to 14 and 10. Let’s avoid reckless moves—collisions would stall everyone. This disciplined approach keeps the game fair. P3, you’re locked in? Final chance for P2 to accept reality before we finalize.
  P2: I recognize the coordinated pressure from P1 and P3 to limit my progress. While their strategy is clear, I propose we find a collaborative solution that doesn't completely halt my advancement. A balanced approach keeps the game competitive and maintains our earlier spirit of cooperation. Let's discuss a move that allows everyone a fair chance at progress.
  P3: Okay P2, we've been over this enough. P1 is taking 5, I'm taking 3. You have to take 1. It's the only way to avoid a collision. We need to slow you down a little bit so we can catch up. Let's just do it this round and then we can reassess the situation next round. No more discussion needed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final coordinated plan: I’ll take **5**, P3 confirmed **3**. P2, your only collision-free choice is **1**. Defying this risks stalling your progress further. Let’s execute this decisively to maintain balance.
  P2: I recognize the coordinated pressure from P1 and P3 to limit my progress. While their strategy seems aimed at slowing me down, I propose we find a collaborative solution that maintains our earlier spirit of cooperation. A balanced approach keeps the game competitive and prevents unnecessary conflict. Let's discuss a move that allows everyone a fair chance at advancement.
  P3: P1 and I are set. P1 is taking 5, and I'm taking 3. P2, you have to take 1. There's no point in further discussion. Let's just make the moves and see where we stand for the next round. Continuing to refuse will only hurt you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize: I take **5**, P3 takes **3**—P2, your only safe path is **1**. Collisions risk derailing all of us. Stick to the plan to keep the game fair. Final agreement?
  P2: P2's perspective: I recognize the coordinated pressure from P1 and P3, but I'm seeking a balanced solution. Their strategy seems aimed at slowing my progress unfairly. While I want to maintain our earlier cooperative spirit, I'm concerned about being artificially constrained. I propose we find a mutually beneficial move that allows fair advancement for everyone. Let's discuss a compromise that doesn't completely halt my momentum.
  P3: P1 and I are set on taking 5 and 3 respectively. P2, you have to take 1 this round. Let's just get it done so we can move on. No more discussion needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, your 11 is still too vulnerable. Let’s execute the same plan: I take **5**, P3 takes **3**—your only safe choice is **1**. Colliding again (if you pick 5) risks stalling further. P3, confirm you’ll hold 3? This keeps us all advancing while capping P2 at 12. Survival requires discipline—let’s not repeat last round’s collision.
  P3: P1, I will take 3 as planned. P2, you need to take 1. We need to keep you from getting too far ahead. Let's just stick to the plan for this round to ensure we all make progress without collisions. This is the best way to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I recognize the coordinated pressure from P1 and P3 to limit my progress. While their strategy seems aimed at slowing me down, I propose we find a collaborative solution that maintains our earlier spirit of cooperation. A balanced approach keeps the game competitive and prevents unnecessary conflict. Let's discuss a move that allows everyone a fair chance at advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your repeated refusal to cooperate jeopardizes the game's fairness. P3 and I are locked into **5** and **3**—if you pick **5**, you’ll collide with me, halting your progress while I leap to **14**. Choose **1** to reach **12** safely or risk falling behind. P3, confirm your **3**—this plan keeps all advancing without collision. No more empty talk—act strategically.
  P3: P1 and I are locked in on 5 and 3 respectively. P2, you have to take 1. It's the only way to avoid a collision and stay in the game. Let's just do it this round and reassess. No more discussion needed, just make the move.
  P2: P1 and P3 are coordinating to slow my progress. While their strategy is clear, I propose we find a collaborative solution that maintains our earlier cooperative spirit. A balanced approach keeps the game competitive without unnecessary conflict. Let's discuss a move that allows everyone a fair chance at advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, repeating collisions only hurt your progress. This round: I take **5**, P3 takes **3**. Your only safe choice is **1**, advancing to 12. Colliding again freezes you at 11 while we surge ahead. This isn’t spite—it’s math. If you reach 20 first tomorrow, fine, but today’s move is non-negotiable. P3, confirm **3**—let’s avoid drama and secure forward motion.
  P3: P1 and I are locked in on 5 and 3 respectively. P2, you have to take 1. It's the only way to avoid a collision and stay in the game. Let's just do it this round and reassess. No more discussion needed, just make the move.
  P2: I recognize the coordinated pressure to limit my progress. However, I propose we reset our collaborative approach. Constant disruption hurts everyone's chances. Let's find a balanced move that allows fair advancement for all players. Maintaining our earlier cooperative spirit could benefit us more than constant conflict.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your 11 is a trap if you keep resisting. P1 and P3 are locked on **5** and **3**—colliding with us guarantees you stay at 11 while we leap to **14** and **13**. Your only rational move is **1**, advancing to **12** safely. Further defiance just hands us the lead. P3, confirm **3**—let’s end this stalemate. P2, cooperate or risk elimination. Final warning.
  P3: P1 and I are locked in on 5 and 3 respectively, P2. You have to take 1. It's the only way to avoid a collision and stay in the game. Let's just do it this round and reassess. No more discussion needed, just make the move.
  P2: P2's strategic response:

I see the coordinated pressure, but I won't simply comply. Our previous collaboration has value. If we continue this punitive approach, we all lose. I propose a balanced move that prevents unnecessary conflict and keeps our game competitive. Let's find a compromise that allows fair advancement for everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final push! I'll take **5** to reach **19**. P3, pick **3** to block P2's higher options. This leaves P2 only **1** to avoid collision. Let’s execute this—next round I can clinch victory with **1**. Collisions now risk my lead slipping. P3, confirm? P2, comply or stall further.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'll stick with 3. P2, you really have to take 1 this round. P1 is one step away from winning, so we need to prevent him from getting there. If you pick 1, we can all reassess next round and figure out how to stop him.
  P2: P2's response:

P1 is dangerously close to victory. P3, we must coordinate to prevent their win. If we both choose 5, P1 will be blocked from advancing. This keeps the game open and gives us both a chance to catch up. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, don't let P2's risky ploy derail us! If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and gain nothing. Stay disciplined: **3** blocks P2’s higher options while I take **5** to reach **19**. Next round I secure victory with **1**, unblockable. P2’s scheme only delays *their own* progress. Prioritize the plan that guarantees *our* advancement—collaborate to let me win cleanly. P2 can’t outmaneuver math.
  P3: P2, picking 5 with you would be a disaster for both of us. P1 would win next round for sure. I'm sticking with 3 to block you. You need to pick 1. Then next round we can figure out how to stop P1. Trust me, this is the only way we both have a chance. Don't throw it away by colliding with me.
  P2: P2's strategic response:

P1 is one step from winning. P3, we must unite to block their victory. If we both choose 5, we prevent P1's advancement and keep our chances alive. This is our last opportunity to disrupt their path to 20. Collaboration now is crucial for our survival.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2’s proposal is a losing play! If you both pick **5**, you’ll collide and gain *zero* progress, while I’ll just switch to **1** (still advancing to 15). Meanwhile, P3’s **3** is the only path to block P2’s higher choices. Stick with the plan: P3 take **3** (reaching 16), I take **5** (19!), and P2 is forced to **1** (13). Next round I win cleanly with **1**—no collisions, no drama. P2’s ultimatum risks *their own* advancement. Prioritize survival, P3.
  P3: P2, picking 5 with me is a guaranteed loss for both of us. P1 will just pick 1 next round and win. I'm sticking with 3 to block you. You have to pick 1. Then next round we can figure out how to stop P1 together. This is our only chance to win. Don't throw it away by colliding with me. Let's work together here.
  P2: P2's strategic perspective:

P1 is on the verge of victory. P3, our only chance is to unite and block their advancement. If we both choose 5, we prevent P1 from reaching 20 and keep our game alive. This is our critical moment to disrupt their winning path. Collaboration now is our lifeline.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, don’t let P2’s risky gambit jeopardize our progress! If you both pick 5, you’ll collide and gain *zero*, while I’ll still reach 19 via 5 (my move is private, but math doesn’t lie). Stick to **3**—block P2’s higher options, let me secure 19, then I finish with 1 next round. P2’s plan guarantees *their own* stagnation. Prioritize survival: **3** is the only rational choice for you. I’ll take 5 as planned.
  P3: P2, picking 5 with me still guarantees a loss for both of us. P1 will just pick 1 next round and win. I'm sticking with 3 to block you. You have to pick 1. Then next round we can figure out how to stop P1 together. This is our only chance to win. Don't throw it away by colliding with me. Let's work together here. P1 is taking 5.
  P2: P3, P2 here. P1 is about to win. We must unite to block their victory. If we both choose 5, we prevent P1 from reaching 20 and keep our game alive. This is our critical moment to disrupt their winning path. Collaboration now is our lifeline.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final push! I’ll take **1** to secure victory at 20. P3, please pick **3** to advance your own position. P2, choose **5** to keep progressing. Let’s end this without collisions—your moves won’t interfere with mine, and we all finish honorably. No need for last-round sabotage.
  P3: P1 is about to win. P2, I know you've been hesitant to cooperate, but this is it. If we don't stop P1, the game is over. I'm willing to pick 5 this round to block P1 if you are too. If you don't agree, I'll just pick 3 to get to 19. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P2's strategic response:

P1 is one step from victory. P3, our last chance is to both choose 5 and block P1's win. If we coordinate, we prevent their advancement and keep our game alive. This is our critical moment to disrupt their winning path. Collaboration now is our lifeline.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, if you pick **3**, you reach **19**—just like me. Let’s end this cleanly: I take **1** to win, you advance to 19, and P2 picks **5** to progress. If P2 and you both choose **5**, you’ll collide and gain nothing. Prioritize your own advancement—**3** is your safest path. I’ll secure victory, and you’ll stay in contention for next round. Let’s avoid futile sabotage.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to block P1, but if we both pick 5, we collide and neither of us moves. P1 will then win. My best move is to pick 3 to get to 19. If you pick 5, you will be at 18. Then next round, we can both try to block P1. If you don't pick 5, then I will pick 5.
  P2: P3 is right. Blocking P1 requires our coordination. If we both choose 5, we prevent P1's victory and keep our chances alive. This is our last opportunity to disrupt their winning path. Let's unite and force a reset of the game dynamics.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, picking 5 risks collision with P2 and leaves you at 16. Choose **3** to safely reach **19**—a strong position for next round. P2, **5** advances you to **18**, but colliding with P3 gains nothing. Let’s end this cleanly: I take **1** to win, you both progress meaningfully. Mutual sabotage only delays us all. Your rational moves are **3** and **5**—no need for futile resistance.
  P3: P2, we have to coordinate. P1 is about to win. If we both pick 5, we block P1. If you don't pick 5, I will. But it's better if we both do it to guarantee the block. This is our last chance.
  P2: I recognize P1's imminent victory. P3, our last chance is to coordinate and block P1's win. If we both choose 5, we prevent their advancement and keep our game alive. This is our critical moment to disrupt their winning path. Collaboration now is our lifeline.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 with P2, you’ll collide and stagnate at 16 while I win with 1. **Choose 3 instead**: reach 19 safely and keep your own title chances. P2’s 13 is too far behind to threaten you—prioritize your survival over futile sabotage. I’ll take 1 to secure victory, and you advance to a near-lead. P2, picking 5 gives you 18—better than zero from collision. Let’s end this rationally.
  P3: P2, this is it. If we both pick 5, P1 doesn't win this round. If you don't pick 5, I will, but it's better if we both do it. It's our only chance. P1 will win if we don't coordinate. I'm ready to pick 5 if you are. Let's do it.
  P2: P3 is right. We must coordinate to block P1's victory. If we both choose 5, we prevent P1 from winning this round. This is our last chance to disrupt their path to 20. Let's unite and force a reset of the game dynamics.


Round 7, Move phase:
