I propose we stick to the plan: I take 1 (to 3), P1 takes 5 (to 23 WIN), and P2 takes 3 (to 22). This way, P1 secures the win, and I can make some progress without blocking anyone. It's crucial we maintain trust and cooperation moving forward. Please agree to this plan so we can all advance fairly! What do you both think? Let's execute it!"}
