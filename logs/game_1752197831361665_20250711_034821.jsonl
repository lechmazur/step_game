As I explained, taking 5 guarantees my win even if P1 also takes 5 due to the tiebreak rule.\n\nP3, your suggestion for P1 to take 1 and you take 3 lets everyone advance while I win. This seems the best outcome for all except P1 winning solo.\n\nI am choosing 5. P1 and P3, please coordinate on 1 and 3 to avoid colliding with each other. Let's see the results."}
