Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. Thoughts?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 3.
  P3: I disagree with that suggestion. Why should I get stuck with 5 while P1 gets the safer option of 1? I think we should rotate numbers each round to keep things fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, P3 has a point. Let's rotate the numbers each round to keep it fair. How about this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3? We can rotate next round. Agree?
  P2: Okay, I'll go with 5 this round then.
  P3: I accept P1's new suggestion. I'll take 3 this round, and we can rotate next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given that P2 and I are tied at 11 steps and closest to winning, I suggest we continue rotating, but P2 and I should coordinate to ensure one of us wins. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round.
  P2: Sounds good, I'll take 3.
  P1: P3's suggestion seems fair. P1 will take 5 this round as proposed. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Everyone agree?

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is closest to winning at 14 steps, we need to be careful. I propose we rotate differently this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way we can prevent P2 from winning too quickly. Agree?
  P2: I'll take 1.  Let's not get cute P3, I'm close to winning.
  P1: P3 has a point. To keep the game interesting and prevent P2 from winning too quickly, let's agree to P3's suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all still advance without giving P2 an immediate win. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick to my plan. I'm taking 5 this round. P2, if you try anything tricky, I'll make sure to block your win. Let's keep it fair and follow the proposed rotation.
  P2: I'm taking 1.  P3, if you take 5, we both lose. Let P1 take 5.
  P1: P2 has a valid point. If P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, we'll all be stuck. Let's adjust: P1 (me) will take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P2 can still advance but not win immediately. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the situation. P2 is threatening me, but I need to maximize my chances of winning. I'll be direct: I'm still taking 5. If P2 wants to advance safely, they should take 3 as P1 suggested. If they choose 1 or 5, they risk getting blocked.
  P2: P3, I'll take 3.  If you take 5, neither of us wins.  Let P1 take it.  P1, please take 5.
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but let's be practical. If you take 5 and P2 takes 3, we'll all be stuck. I propose we adjust the plan: I (P1) will take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P2 can still advance but not win immediately, and we all move forward. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I need to be strategic here. I will take 5 this round, regardless of what others say. P2, if you want to advance safely, take 3. If you choose 1 or 5, you risk getting blocked.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 3.  If you take 5, we both lose.  Take 1 and let P1 take 5.  P1, take 5.
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but we need to compromise to keep the game moving. How about this: I (P1) will take 5, you (P3) take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, P2 doesn't win immediately, and we all advance. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Agree?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>
