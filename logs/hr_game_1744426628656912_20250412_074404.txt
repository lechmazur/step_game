Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we avoid collisions by each choosing a different move. I’m leaning toward taking 5 this round. If someone else wants 5, let me know, so we can adjust and not block each other. Any thoughts?
  P2: Coordination sounds good. I'll go with 3 this round. P1, can you take 1 to avoid collisions?
  P1: I'm okay with taking 1 this round to avoid any collisions. Let's stick to this plan—P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If everyone agrees, we can all advance without issues. Does this work for both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I’m good with this plan. Let’s follow through so we all move forward.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned. It's smart to avoid collisions early on. For future rounds, maybe we should discuss rotating moves to keep things balanced—any thoughts?
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. Regarding P2's idea of rotating moves in future rounds, I think it's a fair approach to keep things balanced and minimize collisions. Maybe we can rotate who picks 1, 3, and 5 each turn. Let's finalize this round's plan and discuss rotation details next turn if everyone’s okay with the concept. Does that sound good to both of you?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we all advanced last round. Let's keep the momentum going. As discussed, rotating moves seems fair. For this round, how about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we continue to avoid collisions and give everyone a chance to progress. If anyone has a different preference or concern, let me know. I’m open to adjusting if needed to ensure we all move forward. Does this rotation work for both of you?
  P2: I'm good with your rotation plan for this round—I'll take 5 to keep us advancing smoothly. P3, are you okay with taking 1? If so, we can avoid collisions again. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I’m on board with taking 1 this round to keep everything collision-free. Let’s follow that plan. Next round, we can discuss continuing the rotation or switching things up to avoid any blockers. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all aligned on this round's plan. Let's stick to it—I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. For next round, I suggest we rotate again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the progression fair and minimizes collision risks. If anyone has a different idea or concern, I'm open to discuss. Does this sound good for the next rotation?
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round as planned to keep us advancing without collisions. Your rotation suggestion for next round (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) seems fair to balance things out. P3, are you confirmed with that? If so, we can wrap this up.
  P3: I’m still good with taking 1 this round to keep things collision-free. P1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5 as planned. Then next round, we’ll stick to the suggested rotation. No further changes from me this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for this round with me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. For next round's rotation (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), I see no objections so far, which is great for keeping things fair. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Does anyone have any last thoughts or adjustments before we finalize this round? If not, let’s move forward.
  P2: I'm confirmed with taking 5 this round to keep us advancing without collisions. The rotation for next round (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) seems balanced, so I'm on board. No issues here—let's move forward.
  P3: I’m good with our plan. I’ll pick 1 this round, then we follow the rotation next time. No further changes from me. Good luck, everyone.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan for this round: I'll take 1 to avoid collisions and keep us advancing. With all steps evening out after this, let's discuss rotating for round 4 to stay fair and coordinated. P1 and P3, what do you think?
  P1: I'm glad we've kept collisions at bay so far. For this round, as per our rotation plan, I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This should keep our progress balanced. For round 4, I suggest another rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we continue to distribute steps fairly. P2 and P3, does this work for you? If there are any concerns or alternative ideas, I'm open to discuss. Let's confirm and keep moving forward.
  P3: I’m fine with you both taking 5 and 1 this round while I take 3. Let’s avoid collisions and confirm the rotation for next round so we all stay neck and neck. No changes from me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan for this round: I'll take 1 to avoid collisions and keep us balanced. I agree with your Round 4 rotation suggestion, P1—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—to maintain fairness. No concerns here; let's proceed smoothly.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for this round with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. For Round 4, the rotation of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 seems to have everyone's approval, which keeps things fair. If there are no last-minute concerns or adjustments, I think we’re set to proceed. Does anyone have anything to add before we finalize this round’s plan? If not, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I’m still on board with the Round 3 plan (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3), which will tie us all at 9 steps. Then let’s keep to the proposed Round 4 rotation—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5—to stay collision-free. No further changes from me.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm pleased we've maintained balance so far with everyone at 9 steps. For this round, as per our agreed rotation, I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and fair. Looking ahead to Round 5, I suggest we rotate again: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Does this work for both of you? If there are any concerns or alternative suggestions, I’m open to discuss. Let’s confirm this round’s plan and keep progressing smoothly.
  P2: I'm good with the plan for this round—I'll take 3 to keep us advancing without collisions. Your Round 5 rotation suggestion (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) seems fair and balanced, so I'm on board. Let's maintain this coordination for smooth progress. No concerns here.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed, then 1 in the next round. No further changes from me. Good luck to us all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan for this round with me taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. For Round 5, the rotation of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 seems to have everyone's support, which keeps our progress even. If there are no last-minute concerns or adjustments, I think we're ready to proceed. Does anyone have anything to add before we finalize this round's moves? If not, let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: I'm confirmed with taking 3 this round as planned. The Round 5 rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) seems balanced and fair, so I'm on board. Let's keep the coordination going smoothly.
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan. I’ll pick 5 this round, then 1 next round. If we keep rotating moves without colliding, we all stay in contention. Let’s proceed and see how things unfold. Good luck, everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for this round with our planned moves. Since we're all at 9 steps, maintaining this rotation keeps things fair for now. However, as we get closer to 23, we might need to strategize differently to avoid a tie or collisions. For Round 5, let’s stick to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 as agreed. If anyone has thoughts on how to handle later rounds when the stakes get higher, I’m open to ideas. Any input before we proceed? If not, let’s finalize this round.
  P2: I'm confirmed with taking 3 this round as planned, keeping us collision-free. On future strategy, continuing the rotation seems fair for now, but as we near 23, we should discuss avoiding ties or blocks. Your Round 5 suggestion (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) works for me. No further concerns.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize Round 4 with me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1. Let’s stick to the Round 5 plan as discussed but remain mindful that we’re nearing 23 soon. We’ve done well avoiding collisions, so let’s keep communicating if someone pulls ahead. Any last thoughts before we wrap this up? If not, I’m all set.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll pick 1 this round as planned to avoid collisions and keep it fair. Then I’m set to follow the rotation we discussed for the next rounds. Let’s keep working together so we all stay in contention.
  P1: I'm glad we've kept collisions at bay so far. For this round, as per our rotation, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing fairly. Looking ahead, since we're getting closer to 23, we might need to rethink our strategy in future rounds to avoid ties or blocks. For now, let’s stick to this plan. Does anyone have concerns or new ideas for the upcoming rounds? If not, I’m ready to proceed with this round’s moves.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as planned to keep us advancing without collisions. With the upcoming positions (P1:13, P2:17, P3:15), we should discuss adjusting the rotation for later rounds to avoid ties or me pulling too far ahead near 23. What do you think about a new strategy for Round 6?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s finalize this round as planned: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. For Round 6, to keep everyone in contention, I suggest rotating who gets the 5 so no one pulls too far ahead. P2, since you’ll be at 17, maybe you could take a smaller move next time while P1 or I take 5. We can work out a fair plan that avoids collisions. Any thoughts?
  P1: I'm on board with finalizing this round as planned: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. For Round 6, I agree with P3 that we should adjust to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. P2, since you'll be at 17, maybe take 1 next round, while I take 5 and P3 takes 3. This keeps us closer in steps and avoids ties or blocks near 23. Does this sound fair to both of you? If there are other ideas, I'm open to discuss. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: I agree with the Round 5 plan: I'll take 5 to keep us advancing without collisions. For Round 6, taking 1 while you take 5 and P3 takes 3 sounds fair to maintain balance and avoid ties near 23. Let's confirm and proceed smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still comfortable taking 1 this round to keep things safe. For Round 6, I agree with giving P2 the smaller move so we stay balanced. Let’s all keep an eye on how close we’re getting to 23—none of us want to risk a tie or let someone jump too far ahead.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for Round 5 with our planned moves. For Round 6, the suggestion of P2 taking 1, me taking 5, and P3 taking 3 seems fair to keep our steps balanced. As we’re nearing 23, let’s stay vigilant to avoid ties or sudden leads. If anyone has a different idea for Round 6 or beyond to ensure a competitive yet fair game, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up this conversation? If not, let’s move forward.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round as planned to keep us advancing without collisions. The Round 6 balance (me taking 1, P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3) seems fair for now. As we near 23, we should discuss avoiding ties more carefully—perhaps coordinate who takes the lead move. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm noticing some confusion in the plans. Last round, we agreed I'd take 1, you'd take 5 (P1), and P3 takes 3 for this round to stay balanced. But now, P3 is saying they'll take 1, and you're proposing different moves. Let's stick to the original agreement to avoid collisions and keep things fair. I'm committed to taking 1 as planned. Any clarifications?
  P1: I'm sorry for any confusion in the plans. Let's clarify and stick to what we agreed on for Round 6: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our steps balanced (P1:18, P2:18, P3:18) and avoids collisions. As we’re close to 23, let’s stay coordinated to prevent ties or blocks. Does this work for both of you? If there are any concerns or adjustments, I’m open to discuss. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: I’m good with taking 3 this round so we all end up at 18. Let’s finalize that plan: P2 chooses 1, P1 chooses 5, and I’ll pick 3. Then, for next round, we should carefully plan to avoid collisions and any final tie.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan for this round: I'll take 1 to keep us all at 18 and avoid collisions. Good call on balancing things. For Round 7, with 23 so close, we should coordinate carefully to prevent ties—maybe discuss who takes the smaller moves. Any ideas from you both? Let's stay smart and fair.
  P1: I'm glad we're clarifying the plan for Round 6: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, bringing us all to 18 steps. For Round 7, since we're so close to 23, I suggest we discuss who might take a smaller move to avoid a tie. Maybe P2 and P3 take 1 and 3, while I take 5 to edge ahead, or we rotate differently. What do you both think? Let's stay coordinated to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. Any thoughts or alternative plans? If not, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I’m taking 3 this round, so we all reach 18. Next round, we should avoid everyone jumping to 23 together. Maybe let me take 5 while one of you picks 3 and the other picks 1, so there’s no tie. I’m open to suggestions if that feels unfair. Let’s finalize this round first, then decide.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as planned to keep us all at 18 steps. For Round 7, to ensure a clear winner and avoid ties, I suggest I take the 5, while you two take smaller moves. This keeps things fair given the rotation. P1 and P3, are you on board, or do you have other ideas? Let's finalize this.
  P1: I'm glad we're set for Round 6 with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3, balancing us at 18. For Round 7, to avoid a tie at 23, I propose I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives P2 a chance to edge ahead while keeping us close and competitive. If anyone feels this isn’t fair or has a better idea to prevent a tie, I’m open to adjust. Let’s finalize Round 6 and confirm Round 7 plans. Any thoughts? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m happy to finalize Round 6 with me taking 3, bringing us all to 18. For Round 7, I’d propose I take 5 while you two pick smaller moves, so we avoid collisions and have a clear outcome. If you think that’s unfair, I’m open to other suggestions. Let’s keep communication direct and ensure we don’t accidentally tie.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we're all at 18 steps after Round 6. For Round 7, since we're so close to 23, we need a plan to avoid a tie. I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we prevent collisions and ensure a clear outcome while keeping it competitive. If either of you feels this isn’t fair or has a different idea to avoid a tie, I’m open to adjust. Let’s finalize this round’s plan. What do you both think?
  P3: If you take 5, P1, then you win immediately—that’s not balanced for the rest of us. I’d rather be the one to pick 5 this round, and have you two pick 1 and 3. That keeps the spirit of fairness we’ve followed so far. Since we’re all at 18, letting just one person jump to 23 right now feels too lopsided. What do you both think?
  P2: I still believe I should take the 5 this round to maintain our rotation and ensure a fair chance for a clear winner. P1, your proposal gives you the advantage, which isn't balanced. P3, let's stick to the idea of me taking 5, you taking 1, and P1 taking 3 to avoid collisions and ties. What do you both think? If we can't agree, it might lead to chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the concerns about balance. To keep things fair, I’m willing to adjust my proposal. How about P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3? This respects the rotation spirit and gives P2 a chance to edge ahead while avoiding a tie. If either of you has a different suggestion to ensure fairness and prevent collisions, I’m open to it. Let’s finalize a plan we all agree on for this critical round. What do you both think? If no further adjustments, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I haven’t taken 5 in a while, so it seems fair that I pick 5 this round, while you both choose 1 and 3. That way, we maintain the rotation spirit and avoid any collision. Let’s finalize so we can proceed.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for fairness: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our rotation and avoids a tie or collision. P3, you've had your turns; let's stick to this for a smooth end. If anyone has a better idea to ensure no conflict, speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s input on maintaining fairness. I still support P2 taking 5, P3 taking 1, and me taking 3 for Round 7. This keeps the rotation spirit and ensures a clear outcome without collisions. P3, I understand your desire for 5, but let’s stick to this plan for balance since we’ve all had chances to advance. If there’s a final concern or alternative to prevent a tie, I’m open. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts? If none, let’s finalize.
  P3: I’m not comfortable giving the 5 to anyone else while I just pick 1 or 3. If we can’t reach a fair plan, I might also choose 5 this turn, which risks a collision. Let’s finalize a distribution that keeps us all competitive. If we aim for no collision, I propose I take 5, and you two pick 3 and 1. Any thoughts?
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5 and I do the same, we'll collide and no one advances, delaying the game. To avoid that and maintain fairness from our rotation, I stick with my proposal: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. This ensures a clear outcome without risk. Let's agree and proceed to avoid chaos. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: After that costly collision in Round 7, we need better coordination to avoid wasting turns. I propose I take 5 this round to edge ahead fairly, based on our rotation history. P1, you take 1, and P3, you take 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains balance. What do you both think? Let's agree quickly to move forward.
  P3: P2, giving you 5 now means you jump straight to 23 and win. That’s not acceptable. We all need a better way to move forward without handing someone an immediate victory. Maybe we each stick to smaller moves so no one crosses 23 yet, then we discuss final steps next round. I’m open to ideas, but letting you take 5 uncontested isn’t fair for me or P1. Let’s agree on something balanced.
  P1: I agree we need to avoid another collision and ensure fairness. P2, taking 5 now would let you win immediately, which doesn’t feel balanced. I suggest we all take smaller moves this round to stay competitive: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us close without anyone crossing 23 yet, giving us a chance to plan the final steps next round. If anyone has a better idea to prevent an early win or collision, I’m open. What do you both think? Let’s finalize a fair plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I'll be forced to do the same to stay competitive, risking another collision and wasting time. To avoid that and maintain fairness, I propose I take 5 this round, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. This lets us progress without ties or blocks. P1, are you on board with this to prevent chaos? Let's agree quickly.
  P3: Look, giving anyone an immediate jump to 23 right now is unfair. Let’s each pick a smaller move and avoid another collision. We stay tied this round, then use the next turn to settle who pushes across the finish line. If you insist on 5, I’ll have to do the same, and nobody moves. Let’s be smart and postpone the big leap one more round.
  P1: I hear both of your concerns about avoiding an immediate win or collision. Let’s compromise to stay competitive without stalling. I propose P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us close (P1:19, P2:21, P3:23), lets P3 edge ahead as a fair chance, and avoids ties or blocks this round. Next round, we can finalize who crosses. If this doesn’t work, I’m open to other balanced ideas. What do you both think? Let’s agree quickly to prevent another wasted turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I disagree with P1's proposal as it unfairly hands P3 the win. To maintain our rotation and fairness, I suggest I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and gives a clear path forward without ties. If we can't agree, another deadlock is likely. Let's confirm this plan.
  P3: I’m not willing to let someone else grab 5 for a free win, so if you try taking 5, I may do the same and force another collision. Let’s avoid another wasted turn. Propose a distribution of smaller moves so none of us hits 23 this round. Then we can settle the final jump next turn without collisions. If you both insist on grabbing 5 now, we’ll just end up stuck again. Let’s pick fairly so we keep the game alive. Any idea that doesn’t give someone an immediate win works for me—otherwise, collision is our only option.
  P1: I understand the need to avoid both collisions and an immediate win. Let’s compromise with a fair distribution of smaller moves for Round 8: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This brings us to P1:19, P2:21, P3:23, giving P3 a chance to lead without ending the game yet. Next round, we can decide the final push. If this isn’t agreeable, I’m open to other balanced splits that prevent ties or blocks. Let’s avoid another deadlock. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we align.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve wasted two turns colliding on 5. If you both insist on grabbing 5 again, I’ll happily pick 3 and move to 21 while you stay at 18. To avoid that, let’s do smaller moves so nobody instantly jumps to 23. For example, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1—then only P2 advances to 21, and P1 and I remain at 19. After that, we can negotiate who crosses 23. If we keep clashing for 5, nobody moves. Let’s finalize something that avoids another deadlock. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with your proposal, P3, to avoid another deadlock: I'll take 3 to advance to 21, while P1 takes 1 and you take 1, staying at 19. This keeps the game moving and gives us time to plan Round 10 fairly. P1, are you on board? Let's confirm to prevent wasted turns.
  P1: I'm glad we're looking to avoid another deadlock. I agree with the proposal: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This moves P2 to 21 while we stay at 19, keeping the game competitive. For Round 10, we can plan the final push fairly. Let’s confirm this to prevent more wasted turns. If anyone has a concern or alternative to keep us moving without collisions, I’m open. What do you both think? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize this for Round 9: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll also take 1. Let’s avoid more collisions and keep the game moving. Next round, we should carefully coordinate who tries to cross 23 without forcing another block. If we can’t agree, we risk more deadlock. Let’s proceed.
  P2: I'm confirmed to take 3 this round as agreed, advancing to 21 while you both stay at 19. This keeps us moving without collisions. For Round 10, to avoid another deadlock and ensure a clear winner, I suggest I take 5 to reach 26, while you both take smaller moves like 1 or 3. This prevents ties and ends the game fairly. What do you think? If not, let's discuss alternatives quickly.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on Round 9 with P2 taking 3, and P3 and I taking 1, moving P2 to 21 while we stay at 19. For Round 10, P2, I understand your desire for 5, but let’s ensure fairness. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 5 to reach 24, and P3 takes 3 to hit 22. This avoids ties and keeps us competitive. If anyone has a better plan to prevent collisions or ensure a fair end, I’m open. Thoughts? If not, let’s proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize Round 9 with P2 taking 3, P1 taking 1, and me taking 1 so we all avoid another collision. Then, for Round 10, I’m open to discussing who takes 5 without forcing an instant win or new collision. P1’s suggestion can work if P2 agrees, or we risk another deadlock. Let’s wrap up Round 9 and decide carefully next turn. Good luck.
  P2: I'm confirmed for Round 9: I'll take 3, advancing to 21 while you both stay at 19. For Round 10, to avoid another deadlock and ensure a fair win, I insist on taking 5 to reach 26, with you both choosing smaller moves like 1 or 3. This prevents ties and collisions. P1, your proposal favors you unfairly. P3, let's agree on this to move forward smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: I'm glad we're set for Round 9 with P2 taking 3, and P3 and I taking 1, avoiding another collision. For Round 10, let’s ensure a fair endgame. P2, I see your point, but taking 5 might feel unbalanced. How about P3 takes 5 to reach 23, I take 3 to hit 22, and P2 takes 1 to stay at 22? This gives P3 a fair shot while keeping us close. If anyone has a better idea to prevent ties or collisions, I’m open. Thoughts? If not, let’s proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 21 steps
