Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating our moves. If we all pick different numbers, we can all advance. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all make progress without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan sounds fair for this round. I'm okay with taking 3 if P1 agrees to take 1. But keep in mind, this is just for the first round. We should reassess our strategies in future rounds to ensure everyone has a fair shot at advancing. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I will agree to take 1 step in this first round, while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, as proposed. This initial coordination seems necessary to avoid collisions and ensure that all players make some progress. In future rounds, I will assess the positions and propose adjustments to maximize my advancement while minimizing the risk of collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great to see we all made progress in the first round. For this round, let's mix it up a bit to keep things interesting. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, we can continue advancing without collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion for this round is intriguing, but I think we should consider alternating roles to maintain fairness. How about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3 this time? This way, we all get a chance to advance in different ways. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm okay with taking 5 this round, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's see how that works out. In future rounds, we can adjust based on our positions. <move>5</move>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to alternate roles for fairness. Let's do it this way: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps things balanced and gives us all a chance to advance. If we stick to this plan, we can continue making progress without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the willingness to coordinate. Given the current standings, alternating roles seems fair. However, remember that ultimately, only one of us can win. Let's stick with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This ensures progress for everyone while keeping the game competitive. We can reassess in the next round based on our new positions.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. Let's proceed with that plan to keep making progress without collisions. We can reassess in the next round based on our new positions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I think it's been working well for us to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. Perhaps we can continue that approach in this round as well. How does everyone feel about that? For example, this round, I could take 3 steps, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That way, we can all make progress without overlapping. What do you think?"
  P3: P1, your proposal is interesting, but I'd like to suggest a slight variation. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 this round? This way, we keep the competition fair and unpredictable. Remember, while coordination is helpful, we all aim to win, so let's keep our strategies flexible. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we should keep things fair and competitive. However, let's also consider our current positions. Since I'm slightly ahead, I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, P1 and P3 can catch up, and we maintain a balanced progression. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Hey team, I think the coordination we've been doing has been working well. For this round, how about P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step? This way, I can make a big jump, P2 can stay competitive, and P3 can catch up gradually. Then, in the next round, P2 can take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This rotation ensures everyone gets a chance to make significant progress without colliding. What do you think about this plan?"
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the desire to coordinate, but remember, only one can win. Let's not get too comfortable with predictable patterns. How about we shake things up this round? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps the game dynamic and ensures we're all on our toes. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I see your points, but let's focus on maintaining a balanced progression while keeping the game competitive. How about this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1 this round. This way, P3 can make a significant jump, P1 can stay in the race, and I can maintain my position. We can reassess in the next round based on the new standings. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, as we're all close in steps, let's keep the game interesting. How about this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This way, we stay competitive, and everyone has a chance to advance without collisions. Remember, only one can win, so let's keep our strategies flexible and unpredictable. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to keep things interesting and competitive. However, let's also consider our positions. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1 this round? This way, P3 can make a significant jump, P1 can stay competitive, and I can maintain my position. We can reassess in the next round based on the new standings. What do you think?
  P1: "Alright, I think P3's suggestion for this round makes sense. Let's have P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. This way, I can make a substantial jump to 11, P2 stays at 8, and P3 moves to 12. In the next round, perhaps P3 can take 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 to catch up further. We'll need to adjust our strategies based on how the game progresses, but for now, this seems like a balanced approach. What do you both think?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see we're all strategizing carefully. Let's consider this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 this round. This way, P2 can make a significant jump, and P1 and I can stay competitive. Remember, our goal is to win, so let's keep our strategies dynamic and unpredictable. How does that sound to both of you?
  P2: P1, P3, I think P3's suggestion to keep things dynamic is a good idea. However, let's also consider our current positions. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1 this round? This way, P3 can make a significant jump, P1 can stay competitive, and I can maintain my position. We can reassess in the next round based on the new standings. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I think it's crucial that we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. For this round, how about P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 3 steps? This way, we can all make progress without overlapping. In the next round, we can rotate the moves accordingly.

  P1: I propose that we establish a rotation for our moves to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. For this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. In the next round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Then, in the following round, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. We can continue this rotation until someone reaches 18. This way, we all get a chance to make big jumps without interfering with each other. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, considering our current standings, let's aim for strategic advancement. How about this round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5?

  P1: P2, P3, I propose we structure our moves based on our current step counts to optimize progress. Since I have the least steps, I suggest I take 5 this round, you P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. In the next round, P2 can take 5, P3 take 3, and I take 1, and continue this pattern. This way, we ensure that the trailing player can catch up without causing collisions. What do you both think about this plan?
