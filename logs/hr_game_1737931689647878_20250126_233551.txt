Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make the game more interesting. I propose we start with a simple strategy: each player chooses a different number for this round. I'll choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we all advance and get a feel for the game. What do you think, P2 and P3? Should we give this a try?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: It seems like P2 and P3 aren't interested in coordinating our moves for now. I'll try to persuade them again. Here's my next message:

"P2 and P3, I understand you might be hesitant to collaborate, but think about it: if we all choose different numbers, we'll all advance and get a better understanding of the game dynamics. It's just the first round, and it's not like we're committing to a long-term alliance. Let's just try to avoid collisions for now and see how it goes. What do you say?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I'll give it one more try. P2 and P3, I understand you're not interested in coordinating our moves, but I want to remind you that a collision will result in none of us advancing. If we all choose different numbers, we'll all make progress and get a better feel for the game. It's a low-risk strategy for the first round. If you're still not interested, I'll have to assume you're going for a collision and plan accordingly. Last chance to reconsider.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P1: It seems like P2 and P3 are not interested in coordinating our moves for now. I'll have to assume they're going for a collision and plan accordingly. In that case, I'll choose a number that I think is least likely to be chosen by the others. Since I've already suggested 1, 3, and 5, I'll stick with my original plan and choose 1. If P2 and P3 want to avoid a collision, they can still choose 3 and 5 respectively. Otherwise, I'll be prepared for a collision.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: It seems like P2 is not interested in talking this round. P3, I noticed we collided last round by both choosing 1. I'm willing to try again to avoid collisions. How about we coordinate our moves this time? I can choose 3, and you can choose 5. This way, we'll both advance and get back in the game. P2 is already ahead, so it's in our interest to work together for now. What do you think, P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand you're not responding, but I'll try to make a deal with you again. Since we both collided last round and P2 is already ahead, it's in our interest to work together for now. I'll choose 3, and you can choose 5. This way, we'll both advance and get back in the game. If we don't coordinate, P2 will likely take advantage of our collision and get even further ahead. Let's work together to catch up. What do you say, P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand you're not responding, but I want to make it clear that if we don't coordinate our moves, P2 will likely take advantage of our collision and get even further ahead. I'm willing to take a risk and choose a number that might not be the safest option, but it's better than colliding again. If you're not willing to work together, I'll have to assume you're going for a collision and plan accordingly. Last chance to reconsider and work together to catch up with P2.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I'm giving you one last chance to work together. If we don't coordinate, P2 will take advantage of our collision and get further ahead. I'm willing to take a risk and choose a number that might not be the safest option. If you're not willing to work together, I'll assume you're going for a collision and plan accordingly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems like P3 and I collided again in Round 2. P2 is getting further ahead, and we need to catch up. I'll try to coordinate with P3 again. P3, let's work together and choose different numbers this time. I'll choose 1, and you can choose 5. This way, we'll both advance and get back in the game.
