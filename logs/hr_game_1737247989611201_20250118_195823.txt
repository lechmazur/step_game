  P1: P2, I'm happy to take 3 if you take 5.  However, if P3 takes 1, they win.  So, let's see what P3 says.  P3, are you willing to take 3 this round to let P2 and I catch up?  If so, I'll take 1 and P2 can take 5.

  P1: P2, if we BOTH pick 3, P3 wins next round no matter what.  If you pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win. If you pick 5, I'll pick 3 and win.  You're throwing the game by picking 3.  Take 1.
  P3: I'll pick 3 this round to reach 17 and win. Good luck everyone!

Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P1, so we're set then: you're picking 3 and I'm picking 1 to block P3. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, changing your mind to 5 is smart.  P2, stick with 1. I'll take 3 and win.
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed, I'll pick 5 steps this round to ensure my win. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Okay, P1, so you're still on 3 and I'm on 1 to block P3, right? Let's make sure we stop them.
