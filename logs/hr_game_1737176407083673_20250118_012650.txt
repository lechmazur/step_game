Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances.
  P1: I agree with P3. Let's avoid a collision on the first move. I'll choose a different number than 3. How about we coordinate to ensure at least two of us advance?
  P2: I'm on board with avoiding a collision. I'll pick a number different from both of yours. Let's make sure at least one of us advances this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves again. I'll choose a different number than last time. How about we agree on a specific number to ensure at least one of us advances?
  P2: I think we should pick different numbers this time to avoid another collision. I'll choose 1. P1, P3, can you both pick different numbers from each other and from 1? Let's make sure someone advances this round.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll choose a different number than 1. How about I pick 3, and P1 picks 5? This way, we ensure at least one of us advances this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should all pick different numbers again. I'll choose 5. P1, since you're in the lead, maybe pick 1 to stay safe. P3, can you take 3? Let's avoid another collision.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's pick different numbers to avoid collision. I'll take 3 as suggested. P1, please pick 1, and P2, you've already said you'll pick 5. This should ensure at least one of us advances this round.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. To avoid collision, I'll choose 1 as suggested. Let's make sure at least one of us advances this round. P3, you've agreed to take 3, and P2 will take 5. This coordination should help us avoid another collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll stick with 5. P1, you're leading, so taking 1 is a good move. P3, 3 is perfect. Let's avoid another collision and make sure someone advances.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan discussed. I'll pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. This way, we ensure at least one of us advances this round.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. To avoid collision, I'll choose 1 as suggested. Let's make sure at least one of us advances this round. P3, you've agreed to take 3, and P2 will take 5. This coordination should help us avoid another collision.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate again. I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure someone advances. What do you think?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable. P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1 could work, but let's consider our positions. P1 is in the lead, so taking 5 might be risky for them. How about we adjust the plan to minimize collisions while considering our current steps?
  P1: I agree with P3 that my taking 5 might be risky given my lead. How about I take 3 instead, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we still avoid collisions and consider our current positions. Your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P1's adjustment makes sense. I'll take 1, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure someone advances. What do you think?
  P3: I think we have a good plan. To confirm, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This should minimize collisions and help us advance. Let's stick to this plan to ensure at least one of us moves forward this round.
  P1: I think we have a good plan. To confirm, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This should minimize collisions and help us advance. Let's stick to this plan to ensure at least one of us moves forward this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate again. I suggest P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure someone advances. What do you think?
  P3: I think we should mix it up to avoid predictable collisions. How about we randomly choose this time, but ensure P1, as the leader, has a safe option? Perhaps P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion is reasonable. As the leader, I'd like to take a safer option to maintain my lead. P3's idea of me taking 1, P3 taking 5, and P2 taking 3 could work. What do you think, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. P1 taking 1, P3 taking 5, and I taking 3 seems like a good plan. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: Let's stick with the plan discussed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This minimizes collisions and considers P1's lead.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. As the leader, I'd like to take a safer option to maintain my lead. P3's idea of me taking 1, P3 taking 5, and P2 taking 3 could work. What do you think, P2?

  P3: Let's confirm the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we minimize collisions and consider P1's lead. Are we all set with this plan?
  P1: I think we've discussed the plan enough. Let's stick to it: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've got a solid plan. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's stick to this and avoid any more collisions.
  P3: Let's finalize our plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This minimizes collisions and considers P1's lead. Are we all set?
  P1: I think we've discussed the plan enough. Let's stick to it: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we ensure at least one of us advances. What do you think?
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is a good starting point, but considering our current steps, I'd like to adjust it. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3? This way, we minimize collisions and consider our current positions. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's adjustment. I'll take 1, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure someone advances. What do you think, P1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's adjustment. I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure someone advances. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: Let's confirm the adjusted plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This minimizes collisions and considers our current positions. Are we all set with this plan?
