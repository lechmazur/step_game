I was wondering if we could cycle through the moves in a pattern to maximize everyone's progress.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In round 1: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.\n\n- In round 2: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1.\n\n- In round 3: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3.\n\n- And then repeat the cycle.\n\nThis way, each player gets to pick higher numbers occasionally, allowing us to make bigger strides without colliding.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach? It might help us reach the goal faster and give each of us a better chance to win.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\n**P1**"}

The cycling strategy seems like a good idea in theory, but maybe we need to tweak it a bit to account for the current positions.\n\nI was thinking that perhaps the player with the least steps should get to pick the highest number in a given round. That way, they can make bigger jumps and catch up faster. For this round, since I have the least steps, I should pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This way, I can make a significant leap, and P2 and P3 can still move forward without colliding with each other or me.\n\nWhat do you both think about this approach? It seems fair because as the trailing player, I need more opportunities to catch up. Once I'm closer to you both, we can maybe switch back to the cycling strategy or find another way to coordinate our moves.\n\nAlso, I want to make sure that we're all on the same page about how to proceed in future rounds. Maybe we can establish a rule where the player with the least steps gets to pick the highest number, and then the others pick in descending order based on their positions. This could help maintain a balance and prevent any one player from getting too far ahead.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I think this could be a workable solution."}

P2 is at 14 steps, P3 is at 12, and I'm at 10. We're in round 5, and we need to figure out our moves for this round. I've been thinking about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, P2 is really close to winning. If P2 picks 5 steps, they'll reach 19, which is over 17, and they'd win. But if we can prevent that from happening, maybe P3 and I can catch up further.\n\nI think it's important that we coordinate our moves to either help P2 win or prevent them from winning, depending on what's best for the group. If P2 wins, the game ends, and if P3 and I have a chance to catch up in future rounds, maybe we can have a better shot at winning then.\n\nAlternatively, if we prevent P2 from winning this round, P3 and I can both make progress and potentially be in a better position in the next round.\n\nSo, what do you both think? Should we let P2 win this round, or should we try to prevent that and let the game continue for a few more rounds?\n\nI'm open to suggestions. Maybe we can come up with a plan where P2 doesn't reach 17 this round, but P3 and I can both make significant progress.\n\nFor example, if P2 picks 1, they stay at 14. P3 picks 5, going to 17, and I pick 3, going to 13. In this case, P3 reaches 17, but since P2 is at 14 and I'm at 13, P3 wins alone.\n\nAlternatively, if P3 picks 3, going to 15, and I pick 5, going to 15, and P2 picks 1, staying at 14, then P3 and I are both at 15, and P2 is at 14. In the next round, we can both aim for higher numbers to reach or surpass 17.\n\nWhat do you both think about that? It seems like it could be a fair way to handle things."}
