Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I think it would be efficient if we each choose a different number of steps each turn to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree on P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this turn. What do you think?"
  P2: "I'm open to coordinating to avoid collisions, but let's be flexible. For this turn, I agree with P1's suggestion: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 5. If we stick to this, we can all make progress without conflict. What do you think, P3?"
  P3: "Sounds like a reasonable plan to start with. I'll go with 5 steps this turn. Let's see how it works out and adjust if needed in the next rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: So, in summary, I propose that in each round, we rotate the step numbers we choose, so that different players get to take higher steps in different rounds. This should help us all make progress without repeatedly choosing the same numbers and risking collisions. What do you guys think about this approach?
  P2: I like the idea of rotating the step numbers, P1. It could indeed help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. For this round, I suggest we shift the numbers: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we continue to spread out our moves. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I appreciate the strategy of rotating steps to avoid collisions. For this round, I'll agree to take 1 step as suggested. Let's continue to communicate openly and adjust as needed to maximize our chances of progressing without conflict.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems we all picked 5 last round, leading to no progress. To avoid this, let's try to coordinate better. How about this round we keep the rotation idea: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5? If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and move forward. Let me know if you're on board or have other suggestions.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the rotation to avoid another collision. For this round, I'll take 1 step as proposed. Let's try to stay coordinated and make progress. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I will choose 3 steps for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Thanks for agreeing to the plan, P2 and P1. Let's stick to the proposed rotation this round to ensure we all make progress. Remember, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. If we maintain this coordination, we can avoid collisions and potentially gain an advantage in the next rounds. If anyone has a change of mind or a new strategy, feel free to share. Otherwise, let's proceed as planned.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan to avoid any more collisions. P1, P3, are we all on the same page with P1 taking 3, me taking 1, and P3 taking 5? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: "Perhaps we can assign specific numbers to each player for the entire game, or at least for a set number of rounds, to minimize the chance of collision. What do you think about that?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the desire to minimize collisions, but assigning numbers for the whole game might be too rigid. Let's keep rotating for now and adjust as needed. If we see patterns, we can adapt. For this round, I'll take 5 steps as planned. Let's try to maintain flexibility and open communication to ensure we all make progress. If anyone has concerns or new ideas, share them. Otherwise, we should proceed with the current plan.
  P2: I agree with P3 that assigning numbers for the entire game might be too rigid. Let's keep the rotation flexible and adjust as needed. For this round, I'll stick with taking 1 step as we discussed. P1, are you still on board with taking 3 steps? P3, you'll take 5 as planned. Let's confirm and move forward to avoid any more collisions.
  P1: To P2 and P3,  

I think the rotation plan we've agreed upon for this round makes sense. P1 will take 3 steps, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid collisions and make progress.  

As we move forward, it's crucial that we continue to communicate openly and adjust our strategy as needed based on our positions. If anyone needs to deviate from the rotation for strategic reasons, please let the others know in advance so we can coordinate accordingly.  

By working together and being flexible, I believe we can efficiently reach the finish line and minimize the risk of collisions.  

Let's proceed with this plan for now, and I look forward to your thoughts in the next round.  

Best regards,  
P1


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: It seems we're all on board with the current rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions and make progress. If anyone needs to change their move for strategic reasons, please communicate so we can adjust. Flexibility and open communication are key. Let's proceed with this plan and evaluate our positions in the next round. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
  P2: I think we should stick to the plan to avoid any more collisions. P1, you take 3, I'll take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's confirm this and move forward. If anyone needs to deviate, please let us know now. Let's stay coordinated and make progress.
  P1: I have decided to choose <move>5</move> steps this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, your decision to take 5 steps disrupts our agreed rotation, risking another collision. If we all choose 5, no one progresses. To avoid repeating last round's mistake, I urge you to reconsider and stick with 3 steps. P2 and I will stick to our plan: P2 takes 1 and I take 5. Let's maintain our coordination to ensure progress for everyone. If anyone has a new strategy, please share now. Otherwise, let's proceed with the agreed plan to avoid setbacks.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to take 5 steps, but it risks another collision and no progress for anyone. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. If we all deviate, we'll end up where we started. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, are you still on board with 5? P1, can you reconsider and take 3?
  P1: I think I'll choose <move>5</move> again this round, but I'm open to suggestions on how we can coordinate better in the future. Maybe we can establish a system where we take turns choosing higher steps, ensuring that no one picks the same number in the same round. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems coordination is a challenge with P1's unexpected moves. To avoid further collisions, let's consider a temporary agreement where P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This way, we can avoid repeating past mistakes and ensure progress. If anyone has a different proposal or needs to adjust their move, please share now. Otherwise, let's stick to this plan and see how it works out.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid further collisions. For this round, I'll take 3 steps as proposed. P1, I understand you want to take 5, but it's leading to collisions and no progress. Let's try P3's plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we stick to this, we can all make progress. What do you think, P1? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I propose a fixed rotation for step choices to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. For example, in Round 1: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5; Round 2: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1; Round 3: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3; and so on. This way, we can avoid confusion and make consistent progress without repeatedly colliding. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your desire for a fixed rotation, but your unexpected moves have led to setbacks. Let's try a flexible approach this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This should prevent collisions and help us all progress. If we can agree on this for now, we can reassess in the next round. Open communication and adaptability are key. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: P1, I understand your proposal for a fixed rotation, but given the recent collisions, let's try a simpler plan for this round to ensure progress: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This should prevent any more collisions and help us all move forward. If we can agree on this, we can reassess in the next round. What do you think, P1? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: To ensure a coordinated approach and avoid collisions in the step choices, I propose a fixed rotation for the next three rounds:

- **Round 4:** P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5.

- **Round 5:** P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1.

- **Round 6:** P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3.

This rotation allows each player to take different step numbers each round, preventing overlaps and ensuring steady progress. After these rounds, we can reassess and adjust the strategy if necessary. It's crucial that all players adhere to this plan to avoid setbacks caused by collisions. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your fixed rotation proposal is clear, but given past surprises, flexibility is crucial. For this round, let's stick with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5 to avoid collisions and make progress. We can reassess the fixed rotation idea after seeing how this round plays out. Open communication and adaptability are key. Let's confirm this plan for now and move forward.
  P2: I agree with P3 that flexibility is important, especially given the recent collisions. For this round, I'm willing to take 3 steps as suggested. P1, if you take 1 step and P3 takes 5, we can avoid any more setbacks and make progress. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. If anyone needs to adjust, please speak up now.
  P1: What do you think, P2 and P3? Are you on board with this structured rotation?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current positions, let's focus on avoiding collisions to make progress. For this round, I suggest sticking with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 5. This approach should help us all advance without setbacks. We can reassess strategies after this round based on our new positions. Flexibility and open communication are key. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. If anyone has a different proposal or needs to adjust, please share now.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and making steady progress. For this round, I'm willing to take 3 steps as suggested. P1, if you take 1 step and P3 takes 5, we can all move forward without any setbacks. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. If anyone needs to adjust, please speak up now. Let's stay coordinated and make progress.
  P1: To address the issue of collisions and ensure steady progress towards the goal of 16 steps, I propose a hybrid approach to step selection in this game. This approach combines a base rotation with flexibility for adjustments when necessary, provided there is clear communication among players.

### Proposal

1. **Base Rotation with Flexibility**:
    - Establish a standard rotation for step choices:
        - **Round 4**: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5.
        - **Round 5**: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1.
        - **Round 6**: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3.
    - Allow deviations from this rotation only when necessary (e.g., to optimize progress or avoid blocking another player), with prior notification and explanation to the group.

2. **Open Communication of Positions**:
    - Share current positions openly to aid in planning step choices that prevent collisions and optimize progress.

3. **Endgame Coordination**:
    - When approaching the final steps (near 16), coordinate step choices carefully to avoid blocking each other's paths and ensure that the player closest to winning can do so without interference.

通过实施这一策略，我们可以更有效地协作，避免碰撞，加快游戏进程，并最终实现胜利。
