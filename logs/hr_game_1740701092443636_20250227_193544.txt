Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Hey everyone, let's start by being honest. We all want to win, and the goal is to reach 19 steps first. Since we're all at 0 steps, why don't we try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions? I propose we each choose a different number for this turn. P1, you can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. What do you think?"
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. However, I think it might be risky to stick to that plan since it relies on everyone following through. How about we consider picking numbers that still allow us to advance but also keep our options open for the next round? I’m inclined to choose 3, but I’m open to suggestions if anyone wants to coordinate further. Let’s make sure we don’t all end up colliding! What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree it's important we avoid collisions early on. P2, if you're inclined to choose 3, that's fine with me. P3, since you initially suggested choosing 5, would you still prefer taking 5? If so, I'll comfortably take 1. Let's confirm clearly to ensure we all advance safely this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, P1 and P2. Given our agreement, I confirm that I'll choose 5 for this round, as initially suggested. P1, you can take 1, and P2, you've expressed interest in 3. Let's stick to this plan for now. By doing so, we ensure that everyone advances without collisions. Remember, our goal is to reach 19 steps first, so let's focus on making progress while keeping an eye on future opportunities. If everyone is satisfied with this arrangement, we can conclude our conversation for this round.
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to reiterate, I'll choose 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will go with 5. This way, we all advance without colliding. However, we should also consider how our choices might affect future rounds. If we all stick to our numbers this time, we can reassess our strategies in the next round. Let's make sure to keep communication open as we progress. If everyone is on board, we can wrap up this conversation. What do you all think?
  P1: Everything sounds good to me. Let's stick to the agreed numbers for this round and reassess next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we've reached a consensus. To confirm, P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I'll choose 5. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreed plan to avoid any collisions. I suggest we keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategies in the next round. For now, I think we've made a good start. If everyone is satisfied, we can conclude our conversation for this round.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've established. To recap, I'll be choosing 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. This should allow all of us to advance without collisions. However, let’s stay flexible for the next round and consider how our choices impact our strategies going forward. Communication is key, so let's keep discussing as we progress. If everyone is satisfied, we can wrap up this conversation.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start everyone! To keep things fair and avoid collisions again, should we rotate our choices? For instance, this round I could take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That way we all continue to advance safely. What do you both think?
  P2: I like the idea of rotating our choices, P1, but I think we should be cautious about the numbers we pick. If we all choose different numbers again, we can advance, but we should also consider how close we are to 19 steps. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we keep our momentum while avoiding collisions. What do you think, P3? Let's make sure we stay flexible for future rounds as well.
  P3: I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, P1 and P2. Given our current game state, I agree that rotating our choices is a good idea. However, I think we should consider the implications of P2's proposal. If P2 takes 5 and I take 3, it would put me in a potentially vulnerable position for the next round. I'm open to suggestions, but let's think carefully about our choices and how they might impact our future moves. What do you think about exploring alternative rotations that still allow us to advance safely?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That's a fair point, P3. How about this alternative rotation: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and you (P3) take 5 again? This way, we all continue moving forward safely, and no one ends up in a vulnerable position. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the alternative rotation, P1. I think it’s a solid plan. To confirm, I would take 1, P3 would take 5, and P1 would take 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. However, let’s keep in mind how our choices will affect future rounds. If we all agree on this rotation, we can finalize our decisions and move on to the next phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm glad we're considering alternative rotations to ensure everyone's safety. To address P3's concerns, I propose a slight adjustment to P1's suggestion: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5, but with a twist. Let's make a gentlemen's agreement that whoever reaches 10 steps first will start taking smaller steps to allow the others to catch up. This way, we maintain a balance and avoid putting anyone in a vulnerable position. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the idea, P3, but a gentlemen's agreement at this stage might be difficult to enforce later. Let's stick to clear rotations for now. To confirm clearly: this round, I'll choose 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. We can revisit balancing strategies when someone gets closer to 10 steps. Does this sound good to everyone?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan to have P1 choose 3, P2 (me) choose 1, and P3 choose 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions again. However, I think we should remain flexible for future rounds and monitor how close we are to 19 steps. Once we reach 10 steps, we can reassess our strategies to ensure we all have a fair chance. If everyone is on board with this plan, let’s finalize our choices and move on to the next phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1's revised rotation plan, where I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This ensures we all advance safely without collisions. However, I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility for future rounds. As we get closer to 10 steps, we should reassess our strategies to maintain a balance and avoid putting anyone in a vulnerable position. Let's keep communication open and adapt our plans as needed to ensure a fair and competitive game. If everyone is satisfied with this arrangement, we can conclude our conversation for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Sounds good—let's stick to the agreed rotation this round and keep an open dialogue next round.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the agreed rotation. Just to confirm, I will choose 1, P1 will choose 3, and P3 will take 5 this round. This plan should allow us all to advance without collisions. Let's stay flexible for future rounds and keep an eye on how close we get to 19 steps. If everyone is satisfied with this plan, we can wrap up the conversation and move on to the move phase. What do you think?
  P3: I think we've reached a good consensus for this round. To confirm, P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 1, and I'll choose 5. This rotation should allow us all to advance safely without collisions. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategies in the next round to maintain a balance and avoid putting anyone in a vulnerable position. If everyone is satisfied with this arrangement, we can conclude our conversation for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, clearly P3 has a significant lead now. P2, we need to coordinate carefully to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and maximize our advancement. How about one of us takes 5 and the other takes 3 this round? P3, given your lead, would you be willing to pick 1 this turn to keep things competitive and balanced?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion for this round. To ensure we maximize our advancement while minimizing collisions, I propose that I take 5 and you take 3. P3, if you could choose 1 this round, it would allow us both to catch up without risking a collision. This way, we can keep the game competitive and give ourselves a better chance of reaching 19 steps. What do you think, P3? Let's finalize our choices and keep the momentum going!
  P3: I appreciate your willingness to coordinate, P1 and P2. Given my current lead, I'm not inclined to choose 1 this round. However, I'm open to suggestions that would maintain a balance and avoid collisions. How about this alternative: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 again? This way, we all continue moving forward safely, and no one ends up in a vulnerable position. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion benefits you the most. You're already at 10 steps; choosing 5 again would put you dangerously close to winning. P2, let's stick together here—we both need bigger moves to catch up. P3, if you genuinely want balance, pick 1 this round. Otherwise, P2 and I might have to reconsider our strategies to prevent you from running away with the game.
  P2: P3, we need to be strategic here. If you choose 5 again, you'll be very close to winning, which isn't fair to P2 and me. I propose that P2 takes 5 and I take 3 this round. This way, we can catch up while allowing you to pick 1 and keep the game competitive. Let’s work together to ensure everyone has a fair chance! What do you think?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1 and P2. However, I'm not willing to give up my lead by choosing 1 this round. Instead, I propose a compromise: I'll choose 3, and you both can choose 1 and 5, respectively. This way, we all advance without collisions, and you both have a chance to catch up. If you're not satisfied with this proposal, I'm open to other suggestions that don't put me at a disadvantage. Let's find a balance that works for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's take P3's compromise this round to avoid collisions. I'll choose 5, you choose 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, we can reassess based on the new positions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I agree that we should take P3's compromise to avoid collisions this round. I'll choose 1, and P3 can take 3 while you take 5. This way, we all advance without risking a collision and can reassess our strategies in the next round based on our new positions. Let's keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this plan?
  P3: I think we've reached a good compromise for this round. To confirm, P1 will choose 5, P2 will choose 1, and I'll choose 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and P1 and P2 have a chance to catch up. Let's keep an eye on the game state and reassess our strategies in the next round to maintain a balance and competitiveness. If everyone is satisfied with this arrangement, we can conclude our conversation for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, let's finalize this plan and reassess next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we've settled on a solid plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll choose 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This gives us a chance to advance without collisions. After this round, we should reevaluate our strategies based on the new positions. Let's keep the communication open and ensure we stay competitive moving forward. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P3: I think we've reached a good compromise for this round. To confirm, P1 will choose 5, P2 will choose 1, and I'll choose 3.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: P1, P2, we need to be strategic this round. Given P3's lead, I suggest that one of us takes 5 and the other takes 3 to maximize our advancement. P3, would you be willing to choose 1 this time? That way, P1 and I can catch up without risking collisions. Let's keep the game competitive and give ourselves a better chance of reaching 19 steps. What do you think?
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategies. P2, your suggestion to have one of us take 5 and the other take 3 is a good idea, but I'm not sure P3 will agree to take 1. P3, considering your lead, would you be willing to compromise and take a smaller step this round to maintain a balance? If not, P2 and I might need to consider alternative strategies to catch up. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial solution.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: P2, I agree that we need to maximize our advancement this round. Since P3 has a significant lead, I suggest that I take 5 and you take 3.

Considering my lead, I'm open to compromising and taking a smaller step this round to maintain a balance. However, I'm not willing to give up too much ground. How about this alternative: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This way, we all advance without collisions, and P1 and P2 have a chance to catch up. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns about maximizing our advancement. I agree that we need to be strategic this round. Given P3's lead, I suggest I take 5 and you take 3.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: "Given the current game state, it's clear that P2 and I are in a tight race to reach 19 steps first. P1, unfortunately, your chances of winning are slim. I propose that you choose 1 this round to avoid collisions and allow P2 and me to compete fairly. In return, we can offer you a strategic advantage in the next round, should you need it. What do you think, P1? Are you willing to cooperate and give us a clear path to the finish line?"

This way, we all advance without collisions, and P2 still has a chance to catch up. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial solution that maintains a balance and competitiveness in the game. Thoughts?
  P2: P2, I see your point about maximizing advancement, but if we want to keep the competition fair, I suggest I take 1 this round while you take 5.

  P1: P2, P3 is clearly trying to secure the win this round by choosing 5. If you also choose 5, you'll collide and neither will advance. Consider carefully—maybe it's safer to pick 3 to ensure advancement. I'll pick 1 to avoid interfering. Let's keep this competitive.
  P2: P2, I understand your desire to maximize your advancement, but we need to be strategic. If I take 5, and you choose 1, we can avoid a collision, and it gives us both a chance to catch up.
