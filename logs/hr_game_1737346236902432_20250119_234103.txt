Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, let's coordinate to avoid blocking each other. If we each choose a different number, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think about P1 choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move> this round?
  P2: P3's plan sounds reasonable. I agree to choose <move>3</move> this round if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance. P1, do you agree?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems there was a misunderstanding last round. Let's try to coordinate again. How about this: P1, you take <move>1</move>, P2, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll stick with <move>5</move> again? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let me know if you're on board, or if you have another suggestion.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I agree to your plan again. P1, please confirm you’ll take <move>1</move> this time. Let’s avoid another collision. If you’re silent, I’ll assume you’re not cooperating, and I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s miscoordination hurt us all. P1, you picked 1 again despite agreeing to 1 earlier, and P3 switched to 1 unexpectedly. Let’s clarify: P1, will you commit to <move>1</move> this time? P3, will you stick to <move>5</move>? I’ll take <move>3</move>. If you don’t confirm, I’ll assume you’re not cooperating and act independently.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration. I’ll stick with <move>5</move> this round. P1, please choose <move>1</move>, and P2, you take <move>3</move>. Let's ensure we all advance this time. If P1 doesn’t respond, we might need to adapt our strategies.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems P1 is not engaging in the conversation phase. P2, let's focus on maximizing our own progress. I'll stick with <move>5</move> again. I suggest you continue with <move>3</move> since it’s been working for you. If P1 continues to choose <move>1</move>, we can avoid collisions and both advance. Let's aim for a smooth round this time.
  P2: P3, I agree to stick with <move>3</move> this round. P1’s silence suggests they’ll likely pick <move>1</move> again, so we can avoid collisions. Let’s focus on advancing steadily. If P1 deviates, we’ll need to reassess next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your progress is strong, but P1’s unpredictability is a risk. Let’s adapt: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to avoid P1 potentially choosing <move>3</move> again. P3, you could take <move>1</move> to minimize overlap. P1, if you’re listening, please confirm your choice. If not, we’ll proceed cautiously. Let’s avoid collisions and maximize our gains.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but switching to <move>1</move> could be risky for me, given my current lead. To ensure I maintain my advantage, I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round. If P1 continues their pattern, you should have a clear path with <move>3</move>. Let's focus on maintaining our progress and adapt if necessary. P1, if you have any input, feel free to share.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see the risk in P1's unpredictability. Given my lead, I’ll stick with <move>5</move> to maintain momentum. P1, if you plan to change your move, please let us know to avoid collisions. P2, if you feel it's safer, you can try <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> depending on your read of P1's likely choice. Let's focus on minimizing risks and maximizing our progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but P1’s unpredictability remains a threat. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid potential collisions with you. P1, if you’re listening, please confirm your choice to avoid blocking each other. If not, I’ll proceed cautiously. Let’s aim for a smooth round and minimize risks.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given my lead, I'll continue with <move>5</move> to push towards victory. P1, your choices have been unpredictable, so if you plan to change your move, please let us know to prevent collisions. P2, I suggest sticking with <move>3</move> since it’s been safe when P1 chooses <move>1</move>. Let's focus on advancing without blocking each other. If P1 remains silent, we might need to adapt our strategies on the fly.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your lead is strong, but P1’s unpredictability is still a concern. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to minimize collision risks. P1, if you’re listening, please confirm your choice to avoid blocking each other. If not, I’ll proceed cautiously. Let’s aim for a smooth round and maximize our progress.
