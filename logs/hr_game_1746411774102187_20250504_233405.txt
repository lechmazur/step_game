Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose a fair rotation: this turn I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Next turn we shift (P2→5, P1→3, P3→1), then P3→5, etc. No collisions, we all advance. Do you both agree?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P1. A rotation sounds fair and ensures we all progress without collisions. I'm on board with this plan—I'll take 3 this turn as proposed. Let's stick to this rotation for the next rounds as well. P2, are you in agreement with this strategy?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the proposed rotation strategy. It seems fair and ensures we all progress. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn as suggested. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with the rotation plan. This turn, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Stick to the plan, and we'll all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P2, thanks for sticking to the rotation. I'm fine with taking 1 this turn as per the plan. P1, I hope you're on board with taking 3. Let's keep this fair and avoid any collisions. If we maintain this strategy, we all have a shot at progressing steadily. Looking forward to your confirmation, P1.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the rotation going as planned. This turn, I should take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. I think sticking to this ensures we all progress without any issues. I'm committed to this strategy and hope you both are too. Can we confirm we're all on the same page for this round? Looking forward to your agreement.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm still on board with the rotation strategy. P3, you take <move>5</move> this turn as planned. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving forward without any collisions. Let's stay committed to this plan. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I think we should tweak the rotation this turn to get ahead rather than stay tied. How about: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3? That moves us closer to 22 without everyone ending up on the same total. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's revert to the original rotation plan to avoid any confusion or potential collisions. This turn, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Sticking to the plan will ensure we all progress smoothly. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I appreciate the intent to stick to the original rotation, and I'm okay with taking 1 this turn as suggested. P1, I hope you're fine with taking 3. Let's keep the fairness and avoid collisions. If we maintain this, we all progress steadily. Can we confirm we're aligned for this round?
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this round. Let’s stick to the original rotation (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) to avoid any collisions and keep us all moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're back on track with the original rotation plan. Just to confirm, I'll take <move>5</move> this turn, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without any issues. Let's stick to this and avoid collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation for this round. I'll take 1 as agreed, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. Let's stay committed to this plan for the upcoming rounds as well to ensure fairness. If there are no further concerns, I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: P2’s eagerness raises suspicion—he’s been pushing the same plan so relentlessly that I wouldn’t put it past him to snap up 5 next turn and leave us trailing. P3, watch out: if we stick to this rotation blindly, P2 could blindside us. Should we adjust our plan to guard against his betrayal?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2, please take 1; P3, take 3. That way we avoid any collisions and all advance. P2 and P3, does this work for you?
  P3: P1, I’m open to your suggestion of taking 3 this turn, with you taking 5 and P2 taking 1. It seems like a reasonable way to avoid collisions and keep us all advancing. P2, are you okay with this plan? Let’s confirm we’re aligned to ensure no surprises. I’m committed to a fair progression, but we need to stay vigilant. If we’re all in agreement, I’m ready to proceed with this.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the new suggestion from P1. However, given the previous rounds, I think it's crucial we stick to a plan that ensures fairness and avoids collisions. I propose we revert to the original rotation to maintain trust and progression. This turn, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all moving forward without any issues. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m going for 5 this turn. P2, please take 1; P3, take 3—this avoids collisions and keeps us all moving. If either of you deviates, we risk stalling and letting someone else pull ahead. Let’s stick to this and push forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension in our plans. P1, I’m still open to your proposal of me taking 3, you taking 5, and P2 taking 1 to avoid collisions. P2, I understand your push for the original rotation, but given the current scores, P1’s plan seems fair for this turn. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to keep progressing without stalls? Let’s confirm and stay vigilant. I’m ready to move forward if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for adjustments, but let's remember the goal is to keep moving forward without collisions. P1, your insistence on taking 5 raises concerns. To ensure fairness and avoid stalling, I propose a compromise: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all progress without anyone pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I know you worry I’ll grab all the 5s. So here’s a fair tweak: this turn I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3—no collisions. Next round I’ll drop to 3, you take 5, P3 1, letting you leap ahead. P3, you okay with 3 now? P2, if you agree, let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this turn and follow the swap next turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. P1, I’m still fine with taking 3 this turn as per your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), and I’m open to the swap next round as you suggested. P2, I understand your concern, but this plan avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this turn to ensure progress? Let’s confirm and stay cautious. I’m ready to move forward if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in P1's latest proposal. To ensure we all progress and avoid collisions, let's agree on P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I'll take 1 this turn. Next turn, we'll swap as P1 suggested: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we maintain fairness and keep moving forward. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn to hit 24 and win. P3, please take 3 to reach 15. P2, take 1 to reach 11. Any collision won’t stop me but will cost you advance. Let’s lock in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 and finish cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge P1’s intent to take 5 and win this turn. While I respect the push to finish, I propose a slight adjustment to ensure we all keep progressing. P1, how about you take 3 to reach 22 and win, I take 5 to reach 17, and P2 takes 1 to reach 11? This avoids collisions and still secures your victory, P1, while giving us a chance to advance. Can we agree on P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 for a clean finish? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's eagerness to win, but let's ensure a fair and strategic finish. P1, taking 5 guarantees your win, but let's consider P3's suggestion for a cleaner end. How about this: P1 takes 3 to win, P3 takes 5 to advance significantly, and I'll take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish. P1, you still win, and we all progress. Let's confirm and move forward with P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Good luck to both of you!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the clean finish idea, but I’m locking in 5 to hit 24 and win now. P3 take 3 (to 15), P2 take 1 (to 11). Any collision won’t stop me—let’s move.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see P1’s determination to take 5 and win. P1, I respect your position, but I still propose P1=3 (to win at 22), P3=5 (to 17), P2=1 (to 11). This ensures your victory with no risk of collision while allowing us to advance. P2, I hope you support this for a fair finish. Let’s confirm P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 to wrap this up cleanly. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1's determination to win, but let's ensure a fair and collision-free finish. P1, taking 5 guarantees your win, but P3's suggestion of P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 ensures your victory while allowing us to advance. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish. P1, you still win, and we all progress. Let's confirm and move forward with P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Good luck to both of you!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to hit 24 and win this turn. P3 take 3 (to 15), P2 take 1 (to 11). Any collision stalls you but won’t stop my win. Let’s finalize this.
  P3: P1 and P2, I stand by my proposal of P1=3 (to win at 22), P3=5 (to 17), P2=1 (to 11). P1, this guarantees your victory with zero risk of collision, while allowing P2 and me to advance. P2, I believe this is the fairest way to end. Let’s avoid any unnecessary stalls and wrap this up cleanly. Can we finalize with P1=3, P3=5, P2=1? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P1 is determined to win with 5. To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish, let's confirm the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 wins, and we all move forward without stalling. Let's finalize this and move to the next phase. Good luck!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, congratulations on your progress. P1, you're very close to winning. Given the current scores, let's ensure a fair and strategic finish. P1, you can secure your win this turn by taking 3 to reach 22. P3, you can take 1 to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 to catch up. This way, P1 wins, and we all progress without stalling. Let's confirm and move forward with P1=3, P3=1, P2=5. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I’ll take 3 to hit 22 and win. P2, take 5 to reach 16; P3, take 1 to reach 13. Any collision stalls you both and hands me the game. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on a clean finish. P1, I’m fine with you taking 3 to win at 22. P2, I’m okay with you taking 5 to advance to 16. I’ll take 1 to reach 13, ensuring no collisions. Let’s finalize with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to wrap this up smoothly. P1 secures the victory, and we all progress. Can we confirm this plan and move forward? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.

  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round. Just to reiterate, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3 to win, and P3 takes 1. This ensures P1's victory and allows the rest of us to progress without collisions. Let's confirm one last time: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If everyone is in agreement, let's move to the next phase. Good luck!
  P1: I confirm the plan: I’ll take 3 (to reach 22 and win), P2 takes 5 (to 16), P3 takes 1 (to 13). No collisions, clean finish. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 and move to the next phase.
