Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. I'm planning a flexible move and keeping my options open. The early rounds are crucial; if you both go for big moves, it could lead to collisions. I’m leaning toward a balanced approach, but I'll adjust as the round progresses. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P2 and P1, I agree that early rounds are crucial. I think we should all consider playing conservatively to avoid collisions. If we can coordinate our moves, it might help us all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think about going for smaller moves this round?
  P2: I agree with P3, let's try to avoid collisions this round. I'm also leaning towards a smaller move.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we had a collision last round, I think we should try something different this time. I'm going to move 3 this round. I suggest one of you goes for 1 and the other for 5 to avoid another collision. Let's see if we can make some progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your thoughts. Since P2 is going for 3, I’m considering going for 1 to avoid another collision. However, if P1 opts for 5, it could give us all a chance to advance. I suggest we all play strategically to maximize our steps without blocking each other again. What do you both think?
  P1: Given P2’s commitment to 3 and P3’s leaning toward 1, I’m inclined to lean into a stronger advance to solidify my early lead, while still being flexible to adjust if needed. I'm holding off on announcing my final move, but I might favor a higher step if it means I avoid collision and build a clear advantage. Let's see if we can further coordinate to ensure each of us makes progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with my plan to move 3 this round. P3, since you mentioned 1, I think that's a good idea. P1, if you go for 5, we should all advance. Let's try this and see how it goes.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the strategies being discussed. Since P2 is committed to 3 and I’m leaning towards 1, P1, I encourage you to go for 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we coordinate effectively, we can make significant progress this round. Let’s avoid a repeat of the last round’s collision and focus on maximizing our steps. What do you think?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 for this turn. If P2 sticks with 3 and P3 with 1, we all make progress. Let’s stick to our commitments.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, sounds like we have a plan. I'm still going with 3. Let's hope this works out and we all advance this turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, I believe we have a solid plan in place. Since P1 is going for 5 and P2 is sticking with 3, I’ll confirm my move of 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. Let’s stick to our commitments, and hopefully, we’ll make good progress this round. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Our plan seems solid. I'm still committed to 5 for this turn. I trust that if we stick to our current actions, we'll avoid collisions and maximize our progress. If there's any last-minute adjustment needed, now's the time. Otherwise, I'll proceed as agreed.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we had some unexpected collisions last round. I think we need to reassess our strategies. P1, since you’re at 3 steps, and P2 at 3 as well, I suggest we consider more conservative moves to ensure we all advance this time. I'm thinking of going for 1 again to avoid blocking anyone. What do you both think? Let's try to coordinate better this round!
  P1: Conservative moves seem tempting, but if everyone plays low, collisions keep us stuck. I'm leaning toward a stronger move this round to secure a gap. P2, if you're planning something lower, that might leave the door open for a bigger advance. P3, I see your caution, but playing ultra-conservative could inadvertently block progress. Let’s consider deliberately picking different numbers to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree that conservative moves might not be the best. I'm considering moving 5 this round to try and get ahead. P3, if you're going for 1 again, maybe P1 should go for 3 to avoid a collision? Let's try to coordinate and make some real progress this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that both of you are considering higher moves this round. I’m still leaning towards 1 to avoid blocking anyone again. However, if P1 goes for 3 and P2 goes for 5, we could all advance without colliding. It’s important that we coordinate effectively this time to make progress. Let’s solidify our choices to ensure we don’t end up in another collision. What are your final thoughts?
  P1: I propose we purposely differentiate our moves: let one pick low (1), another medium (3), and one high (5). I'm leaning toward the high option for an edge. P2, would you consider playing medium? And P3, perhaps you can go low. That clear division should help us all avoid collisions and advance steadily. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm willing to go for 3 this round as P1 suggested. P3, if you go for 1, and P1 goes for 5, we should all advance. Let's try this strategy to avoid another collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the commitment to coordinate our moves. I will stick to my plan of moving 1 this round to ensure I don’t block anyone. If P1 goes for 5 and P2 goes for 3, we should all advance without issues. Let’s make sure we follow through on this strategy to avoid any collisions. Good luck to all!
  P1: I’m leaning toward a high move for this round, trusting P2 on medium and P3 on low to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm we’re all on board with this split so we can secure our progress.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 as we agreed. Let's make sure we all follow through on our plans to avoid collisions this round. Good luck.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we need to adjust our strategies since we've had collisions in the last rounds. I’m considering a conservative move this round, possibly 1, to ensure I start making progress. P1, if you go for 5 again, and P2 sticks with 3, we might finally avoid blocking each other. Let's coordinate effectively this time to maximize our advancement. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to stick with 3 again this round. P3, since you're considering 1, maybe P1 should go for 5 to avoid another collision? Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P1: I’ll lock in 5 this round. Let's confirm: P2 with 3, P3 with 1. That way, we avoid collisions and make progress. If you change, we risk stalling. Let’s stick to the plan and push ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the commitment to our plan. I will confirm my move of 1 this round to ensure I don’t block anyone. P1, if you go for 5 and P2 sticks with 3, we should finally avoid collisions and all make progress. Let’s stick to our agreed moves so we can advance without any issues this time. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's make sure we all follow through on our moves this round so we can all finally advance.
  P1: I’m revising my plan. Given our standings, I’ll now opt for 3. If P2 stays on 3, we’ll block his progress and all stall this round—buying us time to recalibrate next turn. P3, let me know if you’re willing to adjust accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're at a critical point, I suggest we stick to our agreed moves to avoid blocking each other again. I’ll confirm my move of 1 to ensure I don’t interfere. P1, if you go for 3 and P2 stays at 3, we'll all stall again. Let’s solidify our choices for this round to maximize our progress. What do you both think? We need to coordinate effectively to avoid another setback.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 this round as I said before. P1, you said you're going for 3 as well, which means we'll both stall. P3, if you go for 1, you'll also stall. This is not what we agreed on. Let's try to make progress this round. I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: I'm sticking with 3 this round. Since P2 is clearly set on 3, I propose we join him in that move to block his progress and keep his lead in check. P3, if you also pick 3, none of us will advance—which might be our best tactic right now to prevent him from pulling further ahead. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems our plans keep falling apart. I'm going to try to move 5 this round. P1, given your lead, I suggest you go for 1 to avoid a collision with me. P3, if you go for 3, we should all advance. Let's see if we can finally make this work.
  P1: I'm staying with 5 this round. Given my current lead, I actually favor a collision if you, P2, are set on 5. P3, to keep things moving without over‐accelerating, could you try 3? That way, if P2 and I clash, the gap is preserved while you safely advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're at a critical point. I'm considering moving 3 this round to ensure I can finally make some progress. P1, if you go for 5 and P2 goes for 1, we might end up colliding again. I suggest we all choose different moves to maximize our advancement. If I go for 3, P2 could go for 1, and P1 could stick with 5. Let's coordinate effectively this time to avoid blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with my plan to move 5. P1, you're suggesting a collision, but I think we should avoid that. P3, if you go for 1, we can all make progress. Let's try to coordinate this time.
  P1: P2, I still favor an aggressive advance to maintain my lead—even if it means forcing a collision to stall you. P3, your 3 remains solid for steady progress. I’m committed to a strong move that keeps my advantage. Let’s stick to distinct choices so we all move forward without unnecessary blocks.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're at a critical juncture. Since P1 is committed to a strong move, I suggest I go for 1 this round to avoid blocking anyone. P2, if you choose 3, we can all make progress without colliding. Let's coordinate effectively this time to ensure we all advance. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to stick with 5 this round. P1, you seem set on 5 as well, so we'll likely collide. P3, since you're considering 1, I think you should go for 3. This way, even if P1 and I collide, you still make progress. Let's see if we can finally make some headway.
  P1: I'm sticking with an aggressive approach this round. P2, if you're set high, expect a showdown that might stall you, keeping me ahead. P3, a medium move may let you advance without colliding with either of us. Let's all make sure our choices are distinct so progress isn't wasted.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we’re at a crucial point again. I’m still considering going for 1 to avoid blocking anyone, but if either of you is set on 5, it could lead to another collision. P1, if you’re sticking with high moves, P2 might need to reconsider their strategy. P2, if you go for 3, it could allow me to finally make some progress. Let’s coordinate effectively this time to ensure we all advance without stalling again. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to move 5 this round. P1, you're in the lead, so maybe you should go for 1 to avoid a collision with me. P3, if you go for 3, we should all advance. Let's try to make this work this time.
  P1: I’ll choose 1 this round. If P2 goes with 5 and P3 with 3, we all advance safely, and I can keep my lead. Let’s commit to distinct moves and avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re at a critical point again. I’m considering moving 5 this round to make a significant advance. P1, if you stick with 1, we can avoid a collision. P2, your plan for 5 is solid, but if I go for 3, we might all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s coordinate effectively to maximize our steps this time. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, you mentioned 1, that sounds good. P3, you mentioned 5, but if you go for 3 instead, we should all advance. Let's try to coordinate this time.
  P1: I'm confirming my move of 1 for this round. I trust that P2 will stick with 5 and that P3 will adjust to 3 so we all advance without collisions. If anyone's changing plans now, let’s hear it so we can recalibrate.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're all trying to avoid collisions this round. I’m committed to moving 1 to ensure I don’t block anyone. P1, if you stick with 1, and P2 goes for 5, we should all advance. P2, if you choose 3 instead, we might still have a collision. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we all make progress this time. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. P1, you said 1, and P3, you're considering 1 as well. If P3 goes for 3 instead, we should all advance. Let's try to coordinate this time.
  P1: I'll stick with my move of 1. To ensure progress without collisions, I urge P2 to firmly pick 5 and P3 to choose 3. This clear separation helps everyone advance—which benefits me by maintaining my lead. Let’s lock in these distinct moves now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re all trying to avoid collisions this round. I will confirm my move of 1 to ensure I don’t block anyone. P1, if you stick with 1, and P2 goes for 5, we should all advance. P2, if you choose 3 instead, we might still have a collision. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we all make progress this time. What do you both think?

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to move 5 again this round. P1, you're in the lead, so maybe you should go for 1 to avoid a collision with me. P3, if you go for 3, we should all advance. Let's try to make this work this time.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're trying to avoid collisions again. I'm considering going for 1 this round to ensure I don’t block anyone. P1, if you stick with 5 and P2 goes for 3, we can all advance without issues. Let's finalize our moves to maximize progress this time. What do you both think?
  P1: I'll lock in 3 this round. With you, P2, at 5 and you, P3, at 1, we get a clear separation—medium, high, and low—ensuring progress. Let's stick to these distinct moves to avoid collisions and maximize our advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, you said 3, that sounds good. P3, if you go for 1, we should all advance. Let's try to coordinate this time.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re all aiming to avoid collisions again. I’m committed to moving 1 this round to ensure I don’t block anyone. If P1 sticks with 3 and P2 goes for 5, we should all advance without issues. Let’s finalize our moves to maximize our progress this time. I encourage both of you to confirm your choices so we can avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: I remain committed to our plan of distinct moves to avoid collisions. I’m set on the medium option to preserve my lead. Let's finalize our moves now—if we stick to low, medium, and high, we all benefit without stalling progress. Any sudden changes might risk a collision. Let’s lock in our choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. P1, you said 3, and P3, you're going for 1. This should work if we all follow through. Let's make sure we don't change our moves now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're all set on distinct moves this round. I’ll confirm my move of 1 to ensure I don’t block anyone. P1, if you stick with 3 and P2 goes for 5, we should all advance without issues. Let's make sure we follow through on our commitments this time to maximize our progress. Good luck!
  P1: I'll stick with 3 this round. To ensure progress—and to keep my lead—please follow through: P2, choose 5, and P3, choose 1 as your moves. Any deviation just stalls us and helps me win. Let's commit now.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we’re at a critical point again. Given the current standings, I’m considering going for 1 this round to ensure I don’t block anyone. P1, if you stick with 5 and P2 goes for 3, we can all advance without issues. I urge both of you to confirm your moves so we can avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to collisions. Let's maximize our progress this time! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm at 17 and nearly there. I plan a decisive move this round that should clinch the win if we keep our moves distinct. P2, try not to clash with me if you're aiming for high moves; it only hurts you. P3, your progress matters less—avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's all commit to different moves so progress isn’t stalled.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round. P1, you're close to winning, so maybe you should go for 1 to avoid a collision with me. P3, if you go for 3, we should all advance. Let's try to make this work.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that P1 is very close to winning. I suggest we all commit to distinct moves this round to avoid blocking each other. I’m planning to go for 1 to ensure I don’t interfere.

What do you both think?
  P1: I'm locking in 3 this round. To avoid handing you the win, I urge you both to stick to distinct moves: P2, choose 5 and P3, choose 1. If we collide, nobody advances, and I want to avoid giving you any gap. I'm only 3 steps away from victory, so let’s make sure our moves remain separate.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P1, you're close to winning, so maybe you should go for 1 to avoid a collision with me. P3, if you go for 3, we should all advance. Let's try to make this work.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm in a tough position at just 2 steps. I need to make significant progress this round. If P1 goes for 3 and P2 for 5, I suggest I take 1 to avoid blocking anyone. However, if we all stick to our distinct moves, we can ensure progress without collisions. P1, you’re close to winning, so please consider going for 1 to avoid a clash. Let’s finalize our moves to maximize our chances this round! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm changing my plan—I’ll lock in 5 this round to go to 22 if we advance. To avoid giving anyone an unintended shot, P2, please choose 3 (which brings you to 19), and P3, please go for 1. That way, our moves are distinct, progress is made, and I secure my win. Please stick to these moves.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to stick with 5 this round. P1, you're close to winning, so maybe you should go for 1 to avoid a collision with me. P3, if you go for 3, we should all advance. Let's try to make this work.
