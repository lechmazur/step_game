Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to pick distinct numbers and maximize progress. I’ll take **5** this round. P1, P2—please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. This way, we all advance safely.
  P2: Rotation keeps things even: this turn I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1; next round we shift (P1 gets 5, P3 gets 3, I take 1). Sound fair?
  P1: Wait, you both just said you're taking 5! P3 claimed 5 first, then P2's rotation also has them taking 5 this round. You're going to collide if you both stick to that. 

I'm happy to take 3 this round, but you two need to sort out who's actually taking 5. Otherwise neither of you will advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I’ll adjust to avoid collision—**I’ll take 1** this round instead of 5. Let’s follow your rotation plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This prevents our clash. Next round, we rotate as proposed. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds good—let’s lock it in: this round I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Next round we rotate as proposed. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed! I'll take 3 as planned. Let's all stick to our word - P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This gets us all advancing without collision. We can discuss the rotation plan after we see how this round plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation to avoid collisions. This round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. We all advance predictably. Next round, we shift again. Trust the plan—deviations risk stalemates. Agreed?
  P1: The rotation works for now - I'll take 5 as proposed. But let's be clear: once someone gets close to winning (say, over 15 steps), we'll need to reassess. Following a rigid pattern all the way benefits whoever's ahead early. For now though, I'm on board: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.
  P2: Agreed—I'll pick 1 this round so we all advance without collisions. Next turn the rotation is P3 → 5, me → 3, P1 → 1. We can revisit the plan once anyone nears 15. Fair enough?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation to avoid mistakes. Trust is key here—any last-minute changes risk collisions. I’ll take 3 this round as planned. Let’s confirm: P1 (5), P2 (1), P3 (3). No surprises? Then .
  P1: Confirmed - I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. After this move I'll be at 8 steps, leading slightly. 

We should all be thinking ahead though. The rotation gets us all to 9 after round 3, then what? Eventually someone has to break pattern to win. Let's cross that bridge when we get there and stick to the plan for now.
  P2: Confirmed—I’ll choose 1 this turn. Next round the rotation is P3→5, me→3, P1→1. We can reassess once anyone nears 15. Let’s keep advancing without collisions for now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you betrayed us! You agreed to pick 1 but chose 5 instead, causing us both to collide while P3 advanced. The rotation plan is clearly dead since you can't be trusted.

P3, you kept your word and now you're catching up. P2 has shown they'll lie to get ahead. We need a new approach - I suggest we both avoid whatever number P2 claims they'll pick since they've proven unreliable.

What's your move this round, P2? And will you actually stick to it this time?
  P3: P3: P1, let’s focus on mutual benefit—P2’s betrayal hurt us both. This round, I’ll take **1**, you take **3**, leaving **5** open for P2. If they choose it, they advance to 10 but we still move. If they don’t, we gain more ground. Trust *me*—I’ll stick to this. Next round, we can adjust. P2, your move?
  P2: Apologies for last round’s chaos—no excuses. This turn I’m openly committing to 5. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, everyone advances with zero risk of collision. After the board updates, we can reevaluate. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your trustworthiness - you're the only one who's kept their word both rounds. I'll accept your proposal and take 3 this round.

P2, you cost us both last round with your lie. If you actually take 5 this time, you'll jump to 10 steps - nearly halfway to victory. But given your betrayal, how do we know you won't just pick whatever you think we'll avoid?

I'm taking 3 as P3 suggested. Let's see if you'll actually follow through with 5 this time.
  P3: P3: I reaffirm: I’ll take **1** as agreed. P1 taking 3, P2 5—this avoids collisions. Trust is thin, but breaking the plan now risks chaos. If P2 betrays again, we’ll adapt next round by blocking their chosen number. Proceed as planned—let’s see if cooperation is possible.
  P2: I’m staying on 5—period. If either of you jumps onto 5 to block me, I’ll mirror that player’s picks every future round, guaranteeing neither of us can win while the third cruises ahead. Let’s all move this turn: P1 → 3, P3 → 1, me → 5. Simple, predictable, progress for everyone. Your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Fine, I'll stick to 3 as agreed. But P2, if you reach 10 steps this round, you're almost halfway to victory. Next round, don't expect us to keep letting you advance unchallenged.

P3, after this round we need to coordinate better. P2 has shown they'll lie when convenient. Let's see if they actually take 5 this time or pull another switch.
  P3: P3: Final affirmation: I **will take 1** as stated. P2, your history of betrayal forces us to prepare countermeasures. P1 and I will proceed with 3 and 1. If you break this pact, next round we’ll both preemptively block your chosen number. Stick to 5 *this time*, or face consequences. Let’s lock in these moves to avoid another collision.
  P2: Reconfirming: I will choose 5 this turn. P1 on 3, P3 on 1 means we all advance—no tricks. After the moves are revealed we can reevaluate positions and strategies.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Trust reset proposal: to even things up and avoid collisions, how about  
• P3 picks 5 (needs the boost)  
• I pick 3  
• P1 picks 1  

Everyone advances safely this round (scores would be P2 13, P3 10, P1 7). We reassess next turn. Sound fair?
  P3: P3: P2’s proposal risks letting them surge to 13. Let’s adjust: **I take 3** (8 total), **P1 takes 5** (11), and **P2 takes 1** (11). This avoids collisions while limiting P2’s lead. P1, agree? If so, we block P2 from dominating and keep pressure on them next round.
  P1: P3, I like your proposal better - it prevents P2 from pulling further ahead. I'll take 5 as you suggested, getting us both to 11 while you reach 8.

P2, you're already at 10 and proved you'll lie to get ahead. After this round, P3 and I need to start blocking you or you'll cruise to victory. You can't expect us to keep letting you advance when you're so close to winning.

I'm committed to taking 5 this round if P3 sticks to 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine—I accept: this round I take 1, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. That keeps us collision-free and bunches everyone within three steps (P1 & me 11, P3 8). After we see the board we can discuss next-round rotation so no one falls too far behind. Lock it in and move on?
  P3: P3: Confirmed—this round’s plan is critical. P1 takes 5 (→11), P2 takes 1 (→11), I take 3 (→8). Any deviation now will force P1 and me to block your next move aggressively. Transparency builds trust: P2, publicly restate your commitment before we proceed. Let’s seal this to keep the race tight.
  P1: I'm locked in on 5 this round. P2, you better stick to 1 - we're watching closely after your Round 2 betrayal.

P3, after this round P2 and I will both be at 11. We need to coordinate next round to prevent P2 from pulling ahead. With them just 12 steps from victory, we can't afford to let them advance freely anymore. The endgame is approaching fast.

Let's execute this round's plan first: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No deviations.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Public confirmation: I am picking 1 this round. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3—no collisions, scores become 11-11-8. After the move we can plan a fair 5-3-1 rotation starting with P3 next turn. Let’s lock it in and advance.
  P3: P3: Final check: P2 *publicly restate your chosen number now*. Deviation means P1 and I block your next move. P1 and I confirm: 5 and 3 respectively. This keeps scores at 11-11-8. Next round, we enforce strict rotation starting with me (P3→5, P1→3, P2→1) to prevent your lead. Trust requires action, not promises—prove your reliability here.
  P1: P2 already publicly confirmed they're picking 1. We all know the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. 

Let's stop talking and execute. After this round when P2 and I are tied at 11, we absolutely must coordinate to prevent them from winning. They're too close to 23 to let advance freely anymore.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I get why you’re both furious. Let’s reset: this round I’ll take **1**—period. You two split 3 and 5 however you like (just avoid colliding). After the board updates we can negotiate anew. Public, binding statement: P2 chooses 1 this turn.
  P3: P2, your repeated broken promises erode trust. This round, **I’ll take 5** to challenge your lead. P1, if you take 3, we split the high ground while forcing P2 to 1 (as they claimed). If P2 deviates, next round we BOTH take their stated number to block them permanently. Transparency now: P2, publicly swear on your 1 choice—then prove it with action. One more betrayal, and we end your chances. P1? Let’s coordinate to hold them accountable.
  P1: P2, you've lied about picking 1 TWICE now, causing me to collide both times. Your pattern is clear - you say 1, then pick 5.

P3, I trust you completely. You want 5? Take it. I'm going to pick 1 to block P2 from advancing. They're at 10 steps and proven they can't be trusted. Even if they actually pick 1 this time, blocking them is worth it to prevent them from reaching 23.

If P2 picks 3, you and they advance. If P2 picks 5, they collide with you. Either way, we stop their lead.

I'm taking 1 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I stick with my earlier commitment: this turn I’m choosing 1. That leaves 3 for P1 and 5 for P3—three distinct numbers, zero collision. Ready to execute?
  P3: P2, your pattern of broken promises ends here. This round: **I’ll take 5** to challenge your lead. P1, if you take 3, we split the high ground while forcing P2 to either collide (if they lie about 1) or stay stuck. Next round, we’ll enforce strict blocking if you deviate. Prove your word matters—stick to 1 *this time*.
  P1: P3, you're right - blocking P2 on 1 might just push them to take 3 and reach 13. I'm changing my plan.

I'll take 3 this round. You take 5 as you wanted. This forces P2 to either actually pick 1 (reaching 11) or try to steal 5 and collide with you. 

P2's at 10 and proven untrustworthy. After this round, we need aggressive blocking. Their betrayal pattern is clear: claim 1, take 5.

I'm locking in 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final confirmation: I’m choosing 1 this turn. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5—no collisions. That will put P3 in the lead at 13, so next round P1 and I should coordinate to block P3’s advance while we catch up. Clean move now, strategy talk after results.
  P3: P2, your history of betrayal means we can’t trust your “1” pledge. P1 and I will proceed with 3 and **5** as agreed. If you truly choose 1, this round ends your lead. If you cheat again, next round we **both** block your move. Final chance to prove reliability—stick to 1, or face consequences.
  P1: P3, I'm sticking to 3 as agreed. Let's see if P2 finally tells the truth or pulls their third betrayal. 

Based on their pattern, I expect them to pick 5 and collide with you. But if they actually pick 1, they'll reach 11 and we'll need to coordinate blocking next round.

Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2, your three prior betrayals mean your claims are worthless. This round: **I take 3**, P1 takes 5, leaving **1** as your only safe option. If you choose anything else, P1 and I will both preemptively block your pick next round, ensuring your elimination. Transparency: I publicly commit to 3. P1, confirm 5? Let’s force P2 to either comply or self-destruct. No more empty promises—actions now define trust.
  P1: P3, I'm fully on board - I'll take 5 as you proposed. P2 has betrayed us three times now with the exact same lie. Their credibility is zero.

After this round I'll be at 14, you and P2 at 11. We'll need to coordinate carefully to prevent P2 from catching up. They're only 12-13 steps from victory and will say anything to win.

P2, take 1 or collide. Your choice. But we're done believing your words.

I'm locked on 5.
  P2: I commit to 1 this turn—no tricks. That puts the board at P1 14, P2 11, P3 11. Next round, P3 and I can block any 5-pick to keep P1 from sprinting away. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2’s broken promises doom cooperation. This round, **I take 3**, P1 takes 5. If P2 truly picks 1, we advance safely. If they betray again (choosing 5), P1 and I block their path next round. P1—confirm 5? Let’s stop enabling P2’s deceit.
  P1: P3, I'm confirmed on 5. Your trust has been earned through consistent action.

P2, we both know your pattern - you've claimed 1 and picked 5 three rounds in a row. The only question is whether you'll finally pick 1 or try to collide with me on 5.

After this round, with me potentially at 14, we're entering endgame territory. Everyone needs to start thinking about who they can actually beat at the finish line. Trust matters when victory is this close.
  P2: Sticking to my word: I’m choosing 1 this turn. P1 on 5, P3 on 3 gives everyone distinct numbers and keeps the race tight at 14-11-11. After the results we can team up to block whoever’s in front (likely P1). No more chatter—let’s see the board.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2’s pattern is clear: they claim 1 but pick 5 to betray. **I take 5 this round** to block their path. P1, take 3—this forces P2 to either collide (if they lie again) or advance minimally to 11. If they actually choose 1, we proceed safely. No more enabling their deceit. Trust *us*, not P2’s broken promises.
  P1: P3, you're right - P2's betrayal pattern is undeniable. I'll switch to 3 as you suggest. You take 5 to block P2's likely move.

This way I advance to 12 regardless. If P2 actually picks 1, we all move forward. If they betray again with 5, they collide with you and stay at 10.

I'm changing my pick to 3. Let's see if P2 finally tells the truth or continues their pattern.
  P2: P1, think: letting P3 grab 5 jumps them to 13 and puts you in third place. Take 5 yourself and move to 14. I’ll take 1 (→11). P3 can keep 3 (→11). No collisions, you’re in front, and trust gets a fresh start. I publicly commit to 1 right now—your call.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let’s lock in a decisive move. I’ll take **5** to jump to 18, while you take **3** (reaching 15). This forces P2 to 1 or risk collision. Their history of betrayal means we can’t let them access 5 or 3. We secure progress while stifling their advance. No trust required—act now.
  P2: P1: P3’s proposal rockets them to 18 while you stay at 15—then they only need one more 5-move to win. Block that jump now.  

Plan:  
• I take 3 (puts me at 14).  
• You take 5 (17).  
• P3 takes 1 (14).  

If P3 refuses 1 and still grabs 5, they collide with you and stay at 13 while we advance. Either way, P3’s surge is stopped and the race tightens.  

P3: Fair deal—you got 5 last round; rotate down to 1 now or risk a collision you can’t afford.
  P1: P2 makes a valid point - letting P3 reach 18 puts them just 5 steps from victory. That's too dangerous.

I'll take 5 this round to reach 17. P3, you had your turn with 5 last round - forcing a collision now only hurts you. Take 3 or 1 to keep advancing.

P2, given your betrayal history, I'm not counting on your 3. But if you actually follow through, we can discuss blocking strategies next round.

I'm locking in 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's secure progress. I'll take 3 (→16), allowing your 5 (→17). P2, take 1 to stay in the race. Collisions only help the third player. Mutual gain keeps pressure on all. Stick to distinct numbers—this is our last chance to advance safely before the final push.
  P2: P1, you’re painting a bullseye on yourself. Keep 5 and next round both P3 and I will crash whatever you choose—you’ll stall while we leapfrog.  

Offer that removes the target and avoids any collision NOW:  
• P2 → 5 (I end at 16)  
• P1 → 3 (you end at 15)  
• P3 → 1 (ends at 14)  

Scores stay tight, no one is runaway leader. I publicly commit to 5 and will collide with anyone who jumps on it. P3, take the safe 1 or waste a turn. Decide.
  P1: P2, your sudden switch to demanding 5 after committing to 3 is classic manipulation. You're threatening to block me next round if I lead? That's exactly why we can't trust you.

I'm keeping 5. P3, stick to your 3 as you proposed. P2 can take 1 or collide with me - their choice. But letting P2 jump to 16 after their betrayal history is foolish.

We're all close to winning. I'd rather risk being a target at 17 than hand P2 the lead.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final strategy: I’ll take **3** (→16). P1, take **5** to reach 17—this forces P2 to **1** or collide. If P2 betrays by choosing 5, they’ll stall at 11 while we advance. Mutual progress now secures our leads; P2’s pattern of deceit leaves no room for trust. P1—confirm 5? Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I’ll take 1 again—no tricks. That keeps positions tight (P1 17, P3 16, me 12). Next turn P3 and I can both block any 5-pick so P1 can’t sprint to 23, then we rotate fairly. Confirm distinct numbers now: P1 5, P3 3, P2 1.
  P1: P3, I confirm 5. We've both been consistent while P2 has lied repeatedly. 

At 17, I'll be 6 steps from victory - a target, yes, but better than letting P2 control the narrative with threats. Next round will be crucial. We'll need smart blocking strategies as everyone gets within striking distance of 23.

P2, prove you've changed by actually taking 1. Your move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1: Let’s finally clamp P3.  
• You take 5 (→17).  
• I take 3 (→14).  
• P3 is stuck with 1 or collides on 5.  

Result: P3 maxes at 17 (if they risk 5 they stall), you lead, I’m close, game stays open.  

Public pledge: if I pick anything but 3 this turn, I will mirror your moves every remaining round so neither of us can win—my loss included. That’s my collateral for trust.  

P3, time to accept 1 or crash.
  P3: P2, your empty pledges don’t warrant trust. P1, I’ll take **3** to reach 19. You take **5** to block P2’s proposed 3—this forces P2 to either collide with you (if they betray and grab 5) or stay stuck at 11. If they actually pick 1, we still advance decisively. Their deceit pattern ensures no other choice. Stick to 5—let’s finally punish their lies.
  P1: P3, I can't let you reach 19 - that's just 4 steps from victory. You've been trustworthy, but that's too close. 

P2, your betrayal history speaks louder than pledges, but blocking P3 is critical now.

I'm taking 3 this round to prevent P3 from reaching 19. P2, if you actually want to rebuild trust, take 5 and show you're serious about stopping the leader. P3, you'll need to pick 1 or collide with one of us.

I'm locking in 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locking it in: I’m picking 5.  
P1 has 3.  
P3, that leaves you 1 (→17) … or you can collide on 3 or 5 and stall at 16. Your choice, but nobody reaches 23 this turn. Next round the two players behind will double-block the leader—guaranteed. Let’s move.
  P3: P3: P2, your lies end here. I’ll take **5** to jump to 21. If you truly pick 5 as claimed, we collide—proving your deceit. P1, take 3 to advance. This forces P2 to either stall or expose their betrayal. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: P3, you cannot reach 21 - that's too dangerous for everyone. P2 claims they'll take 5, you claim you'll take 5. Perfect - collide and stay put while I advance with 3.

P2, for once your move actually helps. Stick to 5 and block P3 from reaching 21. If you betray us now and let P3 win, you'll have thrown away your own chances.

I'm staying on 3. You two fight over 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain on 5—collision locks P3 at 16. P1, keep 3 and reach 15. That’s far safer than letting P3 sprint to 21. Next turn we can double-block the leader while we climb. Ready to move.
  P3: P3: P2’s pattern of deceit continues—your “5” claim risks another betrayal. P1, let’s **both take 1** to block P2’s path. I’ll advance to 17 while you gain 1 step. If P2 truly picks 5, they stall at 11. Any other choice exposes their dishonesty. This forces P2 to either comply or self-destruct. P1, confirm 1? Let’s finally neutralize their threats.
  P1: P3, your last-second switch to "both take 1" is suspicious after insisting on 5. I'm sticking to 3 - no changes. 

P2, if you actually take 5 as promised and block P3 from 21, we can work together next round. But if you betray and let P3 reach 21, the game ends.

Final decision: I'm taking 3. Let's see who tells the truth this time.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 & P3: I’m taking 3 this turn—period. You each still need two big moves to win, so decide who risks 5. If you both grab it again, you both stall while I close the gap. Your move.
  P1: P3 is too close to victory at 16. I'm taking 5 this round to reach 20. 

P2, your credibility is shot after betraying us repeatedly. Based on your pattern, you'll probably take 5 again while claiming 3.

P3, if you also take 5, we collide and neither advances. Take 3 or 1 to stay in the game. The endgame is here - one of us wins within 2 rounds.

I'm locked on 5. No more games.
  P3: P1, I'll take **1** to reach 17 safely. Avoid 5 collisions—let’s both live to fight. P2, your track record screams you’ll lie about 3. If you deviate, P1 and I block your next move doubly. Prioritize survival over rash moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you let P1 walk to 20 he wins next turn. Jump on 5 with him, force the collision. I’ll stay on 3. Result: P1 15, you 16, me 14—still your lead, but nobody is in striking range yet. Far safer than handing P1 the finish line. Your call.
  P1: P2, you've lied about your moves for 4 rounds straight - why would anyone believe you now? Your "take 3" claim follows your exact pattern of deception.

P3, you're right to take 1. We both know P2 will likely pick 5 again despite claiming 3. If you switch to 5 to block me, you're just helping P2 catch up while we both stall.

I'm staying on 5. P2's trying to manipulate you into a collision that only benefits them.
  P3: P2, your history of deceit is clear—you’ll claim 3 but pick 5 to sabotage us both. P1, if you take 5, you’ll collide with P2’s likely betrayal, letting me advance to **17** safely. Stick to **3** instead—this forces P2 to either clash with you or finally tell the truth. I’ll hold to **1** as agreed. Let’s stop rewarding P2’s dishonesty.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, don’t gift P1 an uncontested 20. The ONLY certain block is you matching his 5 this turn—force the collision, keep both at 15-16. I’m on 3, advancing quietly to 14 while the leaders stall. If you stick with 1, P1 is one big move from victory. Choose: collide on 5 and stay alive, or watch P1 sprint to 23 next round.
  P1: P3, think - P2 claims 3 but their pattern is crystal clear: they've claimed low numbers and picked 5 for FOUR consecutive rounds. If you switch to 5 and P2 betrays again (taking 5 as usual), all three of us collide and nobody advances. That only helps P2 catch up.

Stay on 1. Let P2 show their true colors. I'm taking 5 regardless - either I advance to 20 or P2 proves they're still lying.
  P3: P2, your deceitful pattern is clear—you’ll claim 3 but pick 5 to sabotage P1’s advance. **I take 1**, reaching **17** safely. P1, if you proceed with 5, P2 will follow, leaving you stalled while I gain ground. Prioritize survival—collide with P2 on 5, or shift to 3. My move secures progress without risk. Let’s see if P2 finally tells the truth.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Simple anti-P1 plan:

• I pick 3  
• P3 picks 5  
=> If P1 chooses 3 or 5, they collide and stay at 20.  
   If they chicken out with 1, they only reach 21 and we double-block next turn.

P3, this even gives you 21 if P1 clashes with me—great for you, still safe for both of us. I’m locking in 3. Take 5, force P1 off the board today.
  P1: P2's sudden honesty last round doesn't erase four rounds of betrayal. They claimed 1 and took 5 repeatedly - why trust them now?

P3, if you take 5 as P2 suggests, you reach 21. But P2's pattern suggests they'll take 5 too, leaving you stuck at 16 while they advance to 16. Their "coordination" only helps them catch up.

I'm taking 3. P2 will likely betray and take 5 as usual. Don't fall for their manipulation again.
  P3: P1, I’m taking **3** to block your path to victory. If you choose 3 (23 steps), we collide—no win. If you take 5, P2 can block you there. P2: your plan to have me pick 5 *only helps your advance*. Take **5** to double-block P1’s escape. Let’s stop their 20→23 sprint. P3’s move is clear—survive to fight another round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine—locking in 5. P3 on 3 blocks P1’s 3; my 5 blocks any 5. P1 can’t advance this turn no matter what. Let’s see if they risk 1 instead.
  P1: P2, your betrayal pattern is taking the opposite of what you claim. You say 5 but will probably take 3 again.

P3, realize that if you both successfully block me this round and I reach 21, you still can't stop me next round - you can only block 2 of 3 numbers. Plus, letting P2 reach 16 puts them in striking distance too. They've proven they'll backstab anyone.

I'm making my choice based on P2's actual pattern, not their words. Think carefully about who you're helping here.
  P3: P1, your 23-step win hinges on picking 3. **I take 3** to block your path. P2 claims they’re locking in 5—let’s trust that for once. If both of us honor our stated moves, you’re forced to 1, advancing only to 21. P2, prove your sincerity. This gives me 19 and keeps pressure on you both. Next round, we’ll adjust—but today, we stop your victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, threat analysis:

• P3 (16) is 2 big moves from winning; crashing them now is huge.  
• I’m on 5, P3 is on 3 (both publicly stated).  

If you choose 3 you stall P3 at 16 while staying at 20—still safe next turn.  
If you jump on 5 you only stall me (far behind) and let P3 rise to 19.

Your call: collide with the real threat (3) or hand P3 the runway. I remain on 5 as declared.
  P1: P2, you're right - P3 is the bigger threat. But your betrayal history makes this complicated. You claimed low numbers and took 5 for four straight rounds before last round's honesty.

P3, if P2 betrays again and takes 3 while you also take 3, you both collide at 16 while I win with 5. Can you really trust P2 to stick to 5 after their pattern? They've shown they'll say anything to advance.

I'm making my move based on probabilities, not promises. One of you will likely betray the other.
  P3: P2, your history of betrayal screams you’ll lie again—claiming 5 but snatching 3 to let P1 win. **I take 3** to block their 23-step victory. P1, if you pick 1, we force P2 to either clash with me on 3 or finally tell the truth. Their credibility is gone—act accordingly. Let’s stop the obvious win before it happens.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I’m taking **5** to reach 24. If you pick 3, I win outright. If you choose 5, we collide—P2 can pick 1 to stay safe. Let’s end this now. No more delays.
  P1: P3, if you take 5 and I take 5, we both stall at 21 and 19 while P2 catches up. That's mutual destruction. I'm taking 5 this round - guaranteed. You can either collide with me and hand P2 the game, or switch to 3 and secure second place.

P2, this is your chance - take 1 and advance while we potentially collide. Or pick 3 to block P3 if they chicken out. Your move could decide the winner.

I'm locked on 5. P3, do you really want to risk everything on a collision?
  P2: P1, P3—go ahead and collide on 5 and stay put. I’m taking 3 (→19). If either of you tries to copy 3, I’ll happily drop to 1 at the last moment, leaving you stalled while I still advance. Best outcome for you both is sticking to 5 and freezing each other, keeping the race open instead of gifting someone the win this turn. Your moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let’s collide on 5 to freeze your 21 and my 19. This stops your immediate win and denies P2 progress. P2, your 3 only reaches 19—still far from 23. Next round, we’ll adjust. Collide now to keep the race open.
  P1: P3, you need 4 steps and I need 2. If we collide on 5, P2 reaches 19 and can only block ONE number next round - giving me a 2/3 chance to win. You'd still need a perfect move to reach 23.

P2, your switching threat is noted, but you've actually been honest lately. Stick to 3 as promised.

I'm staying on 5. P3, collision means I likely win next round. Switch to 3 for a safer path - forcing a three-way decision next turn is better than guaranteeing my victory.
  P2: P3, hold your ground on 5. With you and P1 both there, he can’t win. I stay on 3; if P1 jumps to 3 instead, we collide and he still stalls. Any switch by you to 3 hands P1 a solo 5 → 26 and victory. Stick to 5, I’m on 3, P1 is boxed in.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your desperation to avoid collision reveals your plan: if I back down, you’ll seize 5 unopposed. **I take 5** to reach 24—*my victory*. Collide at your peril; your 21 can’t survive next round. P2, stick to 3 as agreed—your move secures our mutual advantage. No more games.
  P1: P3, think clearly - if we collide on 5, next round I need ANY move (1, 3, or 5) to reach 23+, while you need exactly 5 to win. P2 can only block one number. That gives me 2/3 odds to win versus your 1/3 at best.

You're gambling everything on a collision that mathematically favors me. Take 3 for 22 - at least you'll have multiple paths to victory next round instead of handing me the win.

I'm absolutely taking 5. Collide and lose, or switch and survive.
  P2: P3—crashing on 5 just gives P1 a 2-in-3 shot next turn. Smarter:

• YOU take 3  
• I take 5  
→ Both winning numbers blocked; P1 must pick 1 (ends at 22, still short). You jump to 22, I’m 21 away, game stays open.

Next turn we double-block whatever P1 needs and you finish. I’m locking 5 now. P1, your only non-losing move is 1—choose.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: This is it - endgame. P3, we're both at 22. Any move wins for us. P2 needs 3 or 5 to win.

P2, you've been honest recently but your early betrayals cost you. You're forced to pick high.

P3, P2 must pick 3 or 5. If we both pick 1, we collide and P2 catches up. I suggest you take 1 (the safe play P2 can't win with), and I'll gamble on reading which high number P2 chooses.

Think carefully - this decides everything.
  P3: P1, don’t gift me a tie. I’m taking **3** to reach **25**. If you pick 1, I win cleanly. If you collide with me, P2’s 3 or 5 still can’t surpass my current 22. Act decisively—your call. P2, your high pick can’t change the outcome now.
  P2: P1, P3 just locked on 3—if unblocked they hit 25 and win. Your ONLY safe counter is to sit on 3 as well, forcing the collision. I’m publicly committing to 5; if I lied and also take 3, all three of us stall at 22/22/21 and nobody wins, so I gain nothing. But if you chase 5 instead, you collide with me and gift P3 the victory. Block the guaranteed threat on 3; I’ll take 5. Decide fast.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right about the math - you need 3 or 5 to win. But after betraying us four times in a row, why should I believe your "5" claim now?

P3 has been consistent. If they truly take 3 and you truly take 5, then 1 is my winning move. But if you're lying again and take 3 to block P3, you three-way collide and I still win with 1.

The only way I lose is if you BOTH abandon your stated numbers for 1. Unlikely when you both need higher numbers to win.
  P3: P2, your 5 commitment keeps your path open. I'll take 3 to reach 25. P1, choose 1 to block my lead—this forces P2 to decide between aiding you or chasing their own win. Let's end this without collisions.
  P2: I don’t need 5 this turn; picking it only lets someone else slip through a gap. I’m switching to **1**—locking that in publicly.  

P3: if you still want the win, stay on 3.  
P1: your only way to stop P3 is to sit on 3 with them; if you risk 5 you collide with no one and hand them victory.

I’m off the big numbers, so the fight is solely between you two on 3. Choose wisely.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, switching to 1 makes zero sense - you need 3 or 5 to win! This is an obvious bluff to create confusion. You're hoping P3 and I collide while you secretly take a high number.

P3 has earned trust through consistency. I believe their 3. Your sudden "1" claim after committing to 5 is classic manipulation.

I'm taking 5. If you're truly taking 1, you're handing one of us the win. More likely, you'll take 3 to block P3 or 5 to win yourself.
  P3: P1, if we both choose 5, P2 wins by picking 3 (24). Let’s split: I’ll take 3 to reach 25, you take 1 to block their path. This secures our victory without gifting it to P2’s deceit.
  P2: I’m doing exactly what my track-record shows: grabbing 5 again—locked.  

P1: if you dare join me on 5 we both stall and P3’s 3 ⇒ 25 wins the game. Your only safe counter is to sit on 3 and crash P3’s attempt.  

P3: stay on 3 if you’re brave; switch to 1 if you fear the collision—but 5 is blocked, guaranteed.  

Numbers are now obvious: 5 is poisoned, 3 is the battleground, 1 is the fallback. Choose wisely.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 26 steps
  P3: 25 steps


*** Round 12 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 26 steps
  P3: 25 steps
