Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2, let's all choose different moves this round to guarantee we each advance. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5?
  P1: <P3>, your plan gives you 5 steps every round, letting you surge ahead quickly. That's unfair. Let's rotate who takes 5 each turn—I'll take 5 this round, then P2 next, then you. Otherwise, I won't cooperate.
  P2: I agree with P1. We should rotate who gets 5 steps each turn to keep things fair. I'm fine with P1 taking 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1. Next round I get 5, then P3, and so on. Does this work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 for this round."
  P1: Agreed. Let's solidify the rotation: this round 5-3-1, next round 1-5-3 (P2 takes 5), then 3-1-5 (P3 takes 5). Consistency ensures we all advance. Any deviation risks collisions and stalls progress. Stick to the plan, and we maximize collective steps.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our agreed rotation, it's my turn to take 5 steps this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps things fair and ensures we all advance.
  P1: Agreed. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Let's maintain trust to avoid collisions. Next round, P3's turn for 5. Consistency ensures steady progress. Deviating now risks stalling us all.
  P3: Confirming 3 steps for me this round. Let's keep to the rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: 
  P3: Agreed, 3 steps for me.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I will choose 5 this round, P1 please choose 1, and P2 please choose 3.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round while P3 gets their turn at 5 and P1 takes 1. This keeps our successful cooperation going. Let's stick to this pattern.
  P1: Hold on! Original rotation for this round was P3:5, me:3, P2:1. Changing it to me:1 and P2:3 unfairly boosts P2. I'm taking 3 as agreed. If P2 takes 3, we both lose. Let's stick to the plan to avoid mutual loss.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, please choose 1.
  P2: I apologize for my previous message. You're right P1 - the original rotation was P3:5, P1:3, P2:1. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's maintain our successful cooperation and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Agreed. Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Sticking strictly to the rotation prevents collisions and keeps trust. Any deviation here would sabotage all progress. After this, Round 4 resumes with me taking 5, P2 taking 3, P3 taking 1. Consistency ensures we all advance smoothly. Let’s finalize this and execute.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I will choose 5 as planned. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round.
  P2: 
  P1: Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Sticking to this avoids collision. Any deviation now would collapse trust and stall us. Let’s hold the plan. Next round resumes rotation: me 5, P2 3, P3 1. Onward to victory together.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation, P1 should take 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. We're all tied at 9 steps, so maintaining our agreement is crucial for everyone's success. Let's stick to the plan and keep advancing together.
  P3: "Are you in, P2?"
  P1: Agreed. Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Sticking to this ensures we all advance to 14, 12, 10. Next round resumes rotation: P2 takes 5, then P3. Deviating now risks collisions and mutual stagnation. Let’s uphold trust—no one gains by breaking here. Victory is near if we cooperate.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 as per our rotation. Let's keep advancing smoothly.
  P3: Confirming 1 step for me this round as per our rotation.
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation, it's my turn for 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us advancing steadily with no collisions. Let's maintain our successful cooperation pattern.
  P1: Agreed. Round 5: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Next round, P3's turn for 5 steps. Staying disciplined ensures we all advance. Any deviation now would risk collisions, stalling everyone. Let's uphold trust—cooperation benefits us all as we near 20. Victory is achievable if we remain consistent.
  P3: Let's keep the agreed plan going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: Confirming: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Next round P3 takes 5 as planned. Stay disciplined—any deviation now risks collisions and delays victory. We’re all close; let’s finish strong together.
  P3: How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P3 tried to betray our rotation last round by taking 5 instead of 3, causing a collision. This proves we can't trust P3. P1, since you've played fairly, I suggest we coordinate: you take 3 and I'll take 5 this round. This way we both advance and leave P3 behind. They've shown they don't deserve cooperation.
  P3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This round only, then we can reassess.
  P1: <P2>, I'll align with your plan: I take 3, you take 5. <P3>, if you take 5 again, you and P2 collide, stalling both. Take 1 to advance. Trust is broken, but rational choice is clear. Let's avoid mutual loss.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps while P1 takes 3. P3, your betrayal last round cost us both progress. The smart play for you is to take 1 - any other choice risks further collisions and falling behind. Let's be rational here.
  P3: P1 is closer to winning. If we both choose 5, P1 will not win this round, and you will not let P1 win. Think about it.
  P1: <P2>, P3's urging you to collide only costs you. If you take 5 and they do too, you lose. If you take 5 and they don't, you gain. I take 3 either way. Trust our plan; P3's desperation reveals their weakness. Let's advance rationally.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 as planned with P1. P3, your attempt to manipulate won't work - if we collide, we both lose ground while P1 advances anyway. Taking 1 is your only rational move to stay in the game.
  P3: P2, consider choosing 3 instead.
  P1: <P2>, If you take 3, we collide and both lose. Stick to 5: if P3 takes 5, you block them but I advance. If they take 1, you gain. Either way, you avoid mutual loss with me. P3 wants us to collide—don’t let them sabotage your progress. Stay disciplined. Victory is near.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 18 and will win next round unless we stop them. P3, let's both take 3 to block P1's likely move. This is our last chance - if we don't coordinate now, P1 wins for sure. I'll definitely choose 3, so it's in your best interest to do the same.
  P3: 3 to block P1 with you.
  P1: <P3>, Recall Round 6: P2 broke our rotation first, causing your collision. Now he's luring you into mutual loss. If you both take 3, neither advances. If he lies and takes 5, you lose. Take 1 to secure progress. I'm taking 5—either you advance or we all stall. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I reaffirm I'm taking 3 this round to block P1. P3, let's coordinate to prevent P1's win. They're trying to manipulate you because they're desperate. If we both choose 3, we deny their victory and keep the game going. Trust me on this - I have no reason to lie since taking 5 alone wouldn't help me catch up to P1 anyway.
  P3: Let's make sure P1 doesn't win this round.
  P1: P3, think rationally: If you take 3 and P2 does too, you both lose. If you take 1, you gain +1 safely. P2's plan only benefits himself. Don't sacrifice your progress to block me. Choose 1 and survive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll definitely take 3 to block P1. P3, together we can prevent their win. Don't let P1's manipulation sway you - they just want to secure their victory. Stick with me on 3 and we keep the game alive.
  P3: How about you choose 1, and I choose 5? This way at least one of us advances, and if P1 chooses 5, at least you are not colliding with me.
  P1: <P3>, If you take 5, we collide and both lose. If you take 3, P2 might betray you. Only 1 guarantees you +1. I’m taking 5 regardless. Survive this round—choose 1. P2 gains nothing but wants you to fail. Secure your steps; next round is your chance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps
