I’m fine with taking 1 again, if P2 is okay with 3 and P3 with 5. If anyone wants to switch it up to optimize our moves, I’m open to suggestions. Let’s confirm our intentions quickly and keep this round smooth. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: Agreed, let’s stick with the plan for consistency. I’ll take 5 again to build momentum. P1’s 1 and P2’s 3 keep us collision-free. Let’s confirm: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Proceeding as coordinated.
  P2: I'm fine with taking 3 again this round to maintain our momentum. However, let's consider switching up our pattern in the next round to keep things unpredictable.

  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with sticking to the plan for Round 3: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. It’s worked well so far, and avoiding collisions is key while we’re all still building steps. I’m also still open to rotating next round to mix things up as discussed. Let’s confirm this round’s moves and keep progressing. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm fine with sticking to 3 for this round to keep our momentum going. However, I think we should definitely rotate next round as planned to keep our strategy unpredictable.
