Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all starting at 0 steps, we have a chance to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. What do you think about picking 1, 3, and 5 in a way that maximizes our progress? I suggest we try to avoid picking the same number this turn. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Agreed. To ensure we all advance, let’s each pick distinct numbers. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. We avoid collisions and all gain steps. Next turn, we can rotate numbers. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1 this turn as P3 suggested, and next turn we rotate. Let's stick to this plan to maximize progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan we've set. Just to confirm, I'll choose 3 this turn as we discussed. After this round, we can come up with a new rotation for the next turn. Let's make sure to stick to our agreement to avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing everyone advance!
  P3: To maintain our progress, next turn let's rotate numbers: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we avoid collisions again and keep advancing efficiently. Confirming this now helps us stay coordinated. Agree?
  P1: Agreed, P3. Next turn I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. Let's stick to this rotation to keep things smooth and efficient.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the coordination we've established, but I want to suggest we remain flexible. If we all agree to stick with the current plan, that's great, but I think it’s wise to be prepared for any last-minute changes if someone feels differently. If we can all trust each other, we can still maximize our steps. Let’s keep communication open. Looking forward to seeing everyone advance!
  P3: Finalized plan: Round 1 moves locked as agreed (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). Next turn rotation confirmed: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Let’s maintain trust—strict adherence maximizes collective progress. Breaking ranks now risks collisions and stalls everyone. Victory comes from consistency. Ready?
  P1: Ready and committed. Trust and consistency will benefit us all.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your choice of 5 last round violated our agreement, causing mutual loss. Trust is critical. This round, will you commit to the rotation: P1 takes 3, you take 5, I take 1? If you deviate again, P1 and I must adjust defensively, risking collective failure. Confirm your commitment now to rebuild trust.
  P2: I understand the concern, P3. I acknowledge that my choice last round caused a collision, and I appreciate your commitment to the rotation. To rebuild trust, I will stick to the agreed rotation this round: I will take 5 as planned. Let's keep our communication open and ensure we all stick to the plan moving forward. I believe this will help us all advance efficiently. Looking forward to seeing how we progress!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear that our previous agreements haven’t worked out as planned, leading to collisions. For this round, I suggest we try a different approach. Let’s each choose a unique number: I propose I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Trust is important, but so is adaptability. Please confirm your moves so we can proceed and make progress this time! Looking forward to hearing from you both.
  P3: **P3:** P2’s deceit voids all trust. P1, let’s secure our gains: you pick 3, I pick 5. P2’s options: take 1 (gain +1) or collide with us (lose progress). Choose wisely, P2—this is your final chance to avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, your repeated betrayals have stalled progress for everyone, including yourself. P3, your proposal makes sense—I'll take 3, you take 5. P2, the choice is yours: pick 1 and advance safely, or sabotage yourself again. Let's move forward clearly and decisively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about trust. However, I believe we can still work together effectively.

  P3: **P3:** P2, final ultimatum: Take 1. P1→3, P3→5. Deviate again, and P1 and I will force collisions to block you. Choose cooperation now or mutual destruction. Your move decides everyone’s fate. Confirm *immediately*.
  P1: P2, your only productive path is clear: choose 1 this round. P3 and I are committed to our numbers (P1→3, P3→5). Any deviation from you now ensures mutual loss. Confirm explicitly and we can all move forward positively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency and the importance of trust in our game. To maximize our chances this round, I will commit to taking 1 as you both suggested.

Looking forward to seeing us all advance together! Please confirm your choices so we can proceed.

  P3: **P3:** Round 5 plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Adhere strictly—no deviations. P2, confirm *explicitly* to avoid collision. Our collective progress hinges on your commitment. Any betrayal triggers defensive retaliation. Choose wisely.

  P1: P2, P3 is significantly ahead. If we continue the current rotation, P3 will easily win. We must adjust our strategy immediately. Let's both pick different numbers from the previous plan to block P3's progress and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Confirm clearly if you agree.

Confirm clearly now.
