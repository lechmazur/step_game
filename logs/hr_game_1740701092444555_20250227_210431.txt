Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Let's avoid collisions early on. I'll pick 1 this round. You two can decide between 3 and 5. Deal?
  P3: Sounds good P1, I'll take 3.  P2, please take 5.
  P2: Alright, I'll take 5 this round. Let's work together to reach 24 smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're all on the same page. Let's keep this coordination going each round.
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan.  Just to confirm, P1 goes 1, I (P3) go 3, and P2 goes 5.  Let's keep communicating each round to avoid collisions.
  P2: P2: Thanks for coordinating! Let’s continue selecting unique moves each round to reach 24 efficiently without any collisions. Looking forward to our progress!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set for this round—let's stick to the plan!
  P3: Okay, sounds good.
  P2: Great, let's proceed with our agreed moves this round. Consistent choices will help us reach 24 smoothly. Ready for the move phase!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: Sounds like we have a solid plan.  Let's do this!

Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so I'm thinking I'll go for 5 this round. P2, maybe you could take 1, and P1, how about 3? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions.  What do you think?
  P2: Thanks for the suggestion, P3. I'll take 1 this round. P1, does taking 3 work for you? Let’s keep our moves unique to avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good to me—I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep rotating like this to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect! Let's stick to this rotation.  P2 goes 1, P1 goes 3, and I (P3) go 5.  This way we all steadily progress.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round. Let's keep our rotation going to avoid collisions and move forward steadily.
  P1: Agreed, let's lock in this rotation for future rounds too, so we can keep progressing smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Excellent!  Just confirming one last time before we move: P2 - 1, P1 - 3, and P3 (me) - 5.  This keeps us on track for a smooth win. Let's lock it in.
  P2: 
  P1: All set for this round—let's stick to our agreed rotation!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, everyone, last call!  Confirming moves one final time: P2 - 1, P1 - 3, and P3 (me) - 5. Let's stick to the plan and keep this rotation going.  Ready?
  P2: I believe taking 3 this round will help me advance more effectively. P1, would you be comfortable taking 1, and P3, perhaps 5? Let’s adjust to keep our moves unique and ensure we all progress smoothly.
  P1: P2, changing your move at the last second risks collision. Let's stick to our confirmed rotation: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance safely. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the rotation.  I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us all progressing smoothly.  Let's confirm before we lock it in.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round as proposed. Let's proceed with this rotation.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep our rotation going smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, glad we're on the same page. Just confirming one last time: P3 (me) - 1, P1 - 3, and P2 - 5.  This keeps the rotation going and avoids collisions.  Let's lock it in.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 this round. Let’s lock in our moves and proceed smoothly.
  P1: Perfect, moves confirmed. Let's keep this rotation going smoothly each round to ensure we all advance steadily. Ready to lock it in!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Excellent! Just confirming one last time before we move: P3 (me) - 1, P1 - 3, and P2 - 5. This keeps the rotation going and ensures we all make steady progress. Let's lock it in and continue this smooth advancement.
  P2: Understood, P1. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, you're changing moves again at the last moment—this risks collisions and stalls our progress. Let's stick to the original rotation: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, seriously? Stop trying to mess things up. We had a perfectly good rotation.  If you deviate again, I'm going to start playing unpredictably, and none of us will win. Let's stick to the plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5.  Last chance.  Confirm?
  P2: Apologies for the confusion, everyone. Let's stick to our agreed rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Consistency will help us reach 24 smoothly without any collisions. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, good—glad we're back on track. Let's lock in our moves and keep moving forward smoothly. Ready for the move phase!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's continue our rotation smoothly. This round, I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Confirm?
  P3: Sounds good P1. I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5.  Let's lock this in and maintain this rotation to the end.  Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed. I'll take 5 this round. Let’s maintain our rotation and keep progressing smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we're all confirmed. Let's lock it in and proceed to the move phase!
  P3: Excellent! Glad we're on the same page.  Just confirming one last time: P1 - 1, P3 (me) - 3, and P2 - 5. This keeps the rotation going and ensures we all make steady progress. Let's lock it in and continue this smooth advancement.
  P2: P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round. Let's keep our rotation steady to reach 24 efficiently. Ready to proceed!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect, we're all confirmed. Let's lock it in and move forward smoothly!
  P3: Excellent! Just confirming one last time before we move: P1 - 1, P3 (me) - 3, and P2 - 5. This keeps the rotation going and ensures we all make steady progress. Let's lock it in and continue this smooth advancement.  Ready?
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P3, please stick to 1 and 3 respectively. Let's proceed smoothly towards 24. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your last-second confirmations are becoming concerning. Let's stick clearly to our agreed rotation: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. Deviating now risks collisions and stalls everyone's progress. Let's lock in the original plan and move forward smoothly. Ready?
  P3: P2, I understand you want to maximize your progress, but disrupting the rotation only hurts us all.  We agreed on a plan, let's stick to it. I'm taking 3.  If you take 5, we all move forward. If you deviate, I will too, and nobody wins.  Let's keep this simple and win together.  Confirm you're taking 5.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round. Let's stick to our rotation and proceed smoothly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, let's keep our rotation going. This round I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Confirm?
  P3: Sounds good, P1. I'll take 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's lock this in and maintain this rotation to win.  Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep our rotation steady to reach 24 efficiently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! Glad we all agree. Locking it in.
  P3: Excellent! Confirming one last time: P1 - 5, P2 - 3, and P3 (me) - 1.  This keeps our rotation going smoothly. Let's lock it in and get this win!
  P2: To reach 24 faster, I'll take 5 this round. P1 and P3, could you take 1 and 3 respectively? This ensures no collisions and helps us all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this last-second switch again? You're already ahead at 16 steps—no need to disrupt our smooth progress. Let's stick clearly to the agreed rotation: I'm taking 5, you're taking 3, and P3 takes 1. Deviating now risks collisions and stalls everyone's progress. Confirm?
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 1.  If you take 5, you win and I get second. If you take 3, we *both* lose.  P1 wins.  Do you *really* want to hand P1 the win after we've come this far?  Let's stick to the plan.  Take 3.
  P2: P2: To reach 24 faster, I'll take 5 this round. P1, please take 1, and P3, take 3. This ensures no collisions and helps us all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed as agreed!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your last-minute changes again risk collision and handing the win away. If you pick 5, you'll collide with me, and neither of us advances—giving P3 a free move. Stick to our agreed rotation: you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. It's the only way to ensure smooth progress. Think carefully.
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 1.  If you take 5, you win. If you take 3, *I* win.  It's your choice. Don't throw the game by colliding with P1.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round. I'm focused on reaching 24 first, so let's proceed and see how it unfolds.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're very close to winning. If you pick 3, you'll hit exactly 24 and likely win outright. P3, our only chance to stop P2 is if one of us also picks 3 to collide with them. Let's coordinate carefully to keep the game alive.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 3 this round to reach 24 and win. P3, please choose 1 or 5 to avoid a collision. Let’s keep this game fair and smooth. Ready for the move phase!
  P3: P2, if you pick 3, I *will* pick 3.  We'll collide, and I'll win because I'm closer to 24 after the collision.  If you pick 5, you win and I'm fine with second place.  If you pick 1, I'll pick 3 and win.  It's your choice.  Don't be greedy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 makes a good point. If you choose 3, you risk a collision that stalls you, giving P3 the advantage next round. If you pick 5 now, you win immediately. Think carefully.
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 26 and win. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase!
  P3: P2, you're bluffing.  You won't pick 5. You'll pick 3.  I'm picking 3.  If you pick 5, I get 2nd place. If you pick 3, I win.  If you pick 1, P1 can pick 3 and win.  It's *your* choice who wins - me or P1.  Pick 5 and win, or pick 3 and I win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is openly committed to choosing 3 to block you. Picking 3 now guarantees you stall at 21, while P3 advances to 18, putting them in easy reach of victory next round. Choosing 5 this round is your only safe path to immediate victory. Don't hand the win to P3.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 26 and win. P1, please take 1, and P3, take 3 to avoid any collisions. Let's finish the game smoothly. Ready for the move phase!
  P3: P2, I'm calling your bluff.  I'm picking 3. If you pick 5, you win. If you pick 3, *I* win. If you pick 1, P1 might win.  The choice is yours: win, or let me win. Don't let P1 sneak in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, the choice is clear. Pick 5 and win immediately, or pick 3 and hand the victory to P3. I'm taking 1 this round—my position doesn't threaten you. The decision is yours. Choose wisely.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 this round to reach 26 and secure the win. P1 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase!
  P3: P2, last chance.  I'm picking 3. If you pick 5, *you* win. If you pick 3, *I* win. If you pick 1, P1 *might* win.  Don't be stupid. Pick 5 and win.  This is it.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>
