Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s coordinate our first moves to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without conflict. Next round, we can rotate numbers (e.g., P1=3, me=1, P3=5) to maintain momentum. Trust me now, and we’ll all stay ahead. Break the pact, and we risk wasting steps. Your call."
  P3: I'm skeptical of P2's proposal. Why should P2 get the highest number first? I suggest a different arrangement: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This seems more fair than giving P2 an immediate advantage. Or we could all choose different numbers randomly without coordination. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I propose we assign numbers by seating order this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That avoids collisions and I go first now, next round P2 picks 5, then P3. Fair rotation ensures everyone leads in turn. Who’s with me?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Fair compromise: Let’s use P1’s seating order *this round* (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to kick off. Next round, rotate so P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This gives everyone equal turns at each number over time. No need for suspicion—we all lose if we don’t coordinate. Agree now, and we’ll all advance safely. Break the pact, and chaos awaits. Your move, P1/P3."
  P3: I appreciate the compromise. I can accept P1's rotation order for this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), followed by P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 next round. This gives everyone fair turns at each number. But let's be clear - if anyone deviates from our agreement, I'll be forced to play defensively in future rounds. Coordination benefits us all by avoiding collisions. Are we all committed to this plan?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round—no collisions. Next round we rotate as planned. Ready to move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "All agreed. Let's proceed with our plan. No need for further talk. "
  P3: I'm on board with our plan. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round, then we'll rotate next round. This approach gives everyone fair turns with each number. Let's stick to this agreement to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P1: Perfect. We’re all set—time to execute our plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s rotate as agreed: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 this round. Everyone sticks to the plan? No deviations—trust the system. Break it, and we all lose momentum. Ready to move?"
  P3: I'm fine with the rotation as planned: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for this round. I notice P2 and I didn't follow the exact agreement last round (I chose 1 as agreed, but our positions were switched in the discussion). Let's be more careful this time to avoid confusion. I commit to playing 3 this round. Let's keep rotating fairly in future rounds too.
  P1: I’m going to pick 5 this round. P3’s already committed to 3, so we won’t collide. P2, if you also pick 5 you’ll crash with me and nobody advances—think carefully.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Given P1's deviation to 5, I'll adjust to 1 to avoid collision and let all advance this round. P3=3 as agreed. This preserves progress despite broken trust. Next round, we'll need stricter accountability. No more free rides."
  P3: I'm concerned about P1 breaking our agreement so quickly. P1 is being aggressive by claiming 5 again, which puts them at 10 steps - a huge lead. I'll stick with 3 as planned, but this makes me wary of future coordination. P2, I appreciate your willingness to adjust to 1. If we both follow through, at least we'll all advance. But P1's behavior suggests we may need a different strategy going forward.
  P1: Here’s a clear plan: this turn P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 so we all advance without collision. Next round, rotate so P3=5, P1=3, P2=1—each of us gets a turn with 5. Fair and safe. Ready?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirming my move as 1 to avoid collision. P1=5 and P3=3 can proceed safely. Let’s ensure next round follows the original rotation strictly—no further deviations. Trust is fragile, but cooperation remains our best path forward. Ready to move."
  P3: I'll stick with 3 as promised. P1, you're breaking our agreement for personal gain, which undermines trust. After this round, you'll be at 10 steps - nearly halfway to victory. P2 and I will be far behind. I suggest after this round, P2 and I should coordinate to block P1's progress, or we'll both lose. P2, are you willing to form a new alliance against P1's aggressive play?
  P1: P2 and P3, colluding to block me only stalls everyone—if you pick the same number, you both get zero and I’ll happily take 5. Let’s avoid that. Here’s a fair reset for this turn: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1—everyone advances. Then rotate: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; then P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No more deviations. This keeps us all moving. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'll take 1 this round. P1=3, P3=5. Next round I claim 5. Stick to this pact strictly—no loopholes. Trust this once, or we all lose momentum. Let’s move."
  P3: I notice P1 and P2 are suggesting different arrangements. P1 wants P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, while P2 suggests P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. I'm willing to take 5 as both suggest, but we need clarity. P1, you've already broken our agreement once - why should we trust you now? P2, I'm open to alliance against P1's aggressive play. Let's be clear on our final arrangement for this round.
  P1: Final arrangement: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This matches both proposals and avoids any collision. Let’s stick to this and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I appreciate everyone following through last round. I propose we continue rotating fairly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P1 is still ahead at 8 steps, but this rotation gives everyone a chance with different numbers. P2, you deserve the 5 this round as we discussed. Are we all agreed on this plan?
  P1: I can’t agree to take just 1 again—I need to catch up. Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. No collisions, we all advance. P2, P3—are you in?
  P2: "Committed to 5 as agreed in our rotation—P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. If P1 insists on 5, we collide and waste progress while P3 gains. P1, you’re already ahead at 8; greed risks losing control. Take 1 to let us all advance. No more free rides."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are in conflict over who gets 5. P1, you're already leading with 8 steps - taking 1 this round is fair rotation. P2 deserves 5 as agreed. If you both choose 5, you'll both get zero progress while I advance with 3. I strongly support P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 for this round. P1, please reconsider your position - cooperation benefits everyone, and you're still ahead even with 1.
  P1: Alright—I’ll take 1 this round so we all advance without collision. P2=5, P3=3 gets us each to 9. Next round, I get 5, P2=1, P3=3 so I can catch up. Let’s commit to that two-step plan.
  P2: "Confirming my move as 5 this round per our rotation (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3). P1, you’ve already agreed to take 1 to let us all advance. Deviating now would only waste progress and widen the gap. Stick to the pact, and you’ll get 5 next round. Let’s finalize this and move."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the current plan: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 for this round. This fair rotation keeps us all advancing. P1, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 this round - it shows good faith. And yes, you should get 5 next round as you suggested. Let's stick to this agreement and avoid unnecessary collisions. We all benefit from coordination.
  P1: I’m committed: I’ll take 1 this round, P2=5, P3=3. Next round I get 5, P2=1, P3=3 as agreed. If we all stick, we each reach 9 steps and stay tied. Deviation only helps someone pull ahead. Let’s move.
  P2: "Confirming my move as 5—no last-minute changes. P1=1, P3=3 as finalized. Deviating now only wastes progress. Trust the plan, or we all lose ground. Let’s execute."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 for this round. This keeps us all advancing steadily. I support P1 getting 5 next round as discussed. Let's maintain this cooperation - it's working well so far. I'll definitely play 3 this round as promised.
  P1: I confirm: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3 so we all advance to 9. Next round I get 5, P2 1, P3 3 exactly as agreed. Any last‐minute deviation only hurts all of us. Ready to move?
  P2: "Confirming move 5 as agreed. P1=1, P3=3—no changes. Deviation risks collision and stalls progress. Trust the plan—we all reach 9 this round. Next round, P1 gets 5 as promised. Final confirmation: stick to the pact."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Round 4 follows our agreed rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. P1, you’ve earned this round’s 5 as planned. P3, this maintains our balanced progression. Deviating now would waste momentum for all—stay committed. Let’s move as one."
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 5 this round—P2 you take 1, P3 take 3. No more deviations; collisions only help the third party. Let’s execute and advance.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, and honors our previous agreement that P1 would get 5 this round. We're all tied at 9 steps now, so fair rotation is in everyone's best interest. I commit to playing 3 this round, and suggest we continue this rotation pattern in future rounds. Cooperation has worked well so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Confirming my move as 1. P1=5 and P3=3 as agreed. Deviating now only causes collision and stalls progress. Trust the plan—we all advance. Final confirmation: stick to the pact."
  P1: 
  P3: I confirm I'll play 3 as agreed. Our rotation system is working perfectly - we're all tied at 9 steps and making steady progress. I suggest continuing this pattern in future rounds (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, then rotate). This fair approach ensures we all advance consistently. I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirming once more: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No deviations—this ensures mutual progress. Trust the system we’ve built. Let’s finalize and move. "
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If anyone has doubts, speak now—otherwise let’s finalize and advance. We’re tied at 9; this rotation keeps us all moving safely. No last‐minute collisions, agreed?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. Our rotation system has kept us perfectly balanced at 9 steps each. I'll definitely play 3 as promised. Let's continue this fair rotation in future rounds too.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final confirmation: P2=1. P1=5, P3=3—no changes. Trust the rotation, no last-minute greed. We all advance together. Let’s execute and stay tied."
  P1: Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round as agreed. And to keep momentum, let’s lock in the same assignments next round too: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. After two straight rounds, we can revert to full rotation. This ensures smooth progress and rewards reliability. Please confirm now.
  P3: I disagree with P1's last-minute proposal to keep the same numbers for two rounds. That would give P1 an unfair 10-step advantage. We should stick to our rotation system: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round, then rotate to P2=5, P3=1, P1=3 next round. Fair rotation has kept us perfectly balanced so far. Let's not change what's working. I'll play 3 this round as agreed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 3 this round—let’s have P2 = 5 and P3 = 1. That gets us to P1=17, P2=15, P3=13 without any collisions. Next round I’ll take 5 for the winning push, while P2=3 and P3=1. Any deviation now only risks blocking you guys and letting someone else leap ahead. Who’s with me?
  P2: "Rejecting P1’s plan—it locks their lead. Let’s rotate properly: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. I take 5 to catch up, P3 gains 3, P1 slows. This mirrors Round 3’s fair rotation. P3, backing this ensures we both close the gap. P1, either comply or collide. My move is final—"
  P3: I support P2's rotation plan: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This follows our established pattern and helps balance the game. P1 is trying to secure their lead by breaking rotation. If P1 insists on taking 3, both P2 and I should pick 3 to block them. P1, you're already ahead - playing fairly keeps the game competitive. P2 deserves 5 this round according to our rotation. Let's stick to the system that's worked well so far.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 – here’s the only safe path this turn: I’m committing to 3, so for no collision P2 must take 5 and P3 take 1. That leaves us at P1=17, P2=15, P3=13. If you refuse and collide, neither of you advances and I’ll grab 5 next round to win. Confirm P2=5, P3=1 now.
  P2: "Confirming move 5. P3, back me with 3 to block P1. If P1 insists on 3, we collide and stall their push. P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 (or stuck). Finalize now—no more deals."
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 as P2 suggested. P1 is already ahead and trying to secure victory. P2 and I need to coordinate to keep the game competitive. The fair rotation is P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. P1, if you insist on 3, we'll collide and you'll gain nothing. Better to take 1 and keep advancing than risk collision. P2, I support your plan to maintain balance. Let's hold firm to our rotation system.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, look ahead: if you back P2’s plan (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3), we all hit 15, then I grab 5 next round and you only reach 18—you lose. My plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts you at 13 now but guarantees you the 5 in Round 6, tying us at 18 and giving you first shot at 5 in Round 7 to win. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm, or we risk collisions that hand P2 the game.
  P2: "Confirming move 5. P3, back me with 3 to block P1. If P1 insists on 3, we collide and stall their push. P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 (or stuck). Finalize now—no more deals."
  P3: I see P1's strategy - they're trying to split P2 and me. But if I take 1 now, P1 will be too far ahead. I'm sticking with 3 to block P1's advance. P2, let's hold firm with our plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). This gives us both a chance to catch up. P1 is trying to manipulate us because they're worried about losing their lead. Coordination between P2 and me is our best strategy now. P1, take 1 or we'll collide and you gain nothing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P2, if you dare pick 5 too, we both crash and P3 grabs 3 to leapfrog us. Your only safe advance is 1. P3, you’re at 12—3 gets you to 15, still behind my 19. But if P2 picks 5 to block, you’ll win with 3. P2 must take 1 and P3 must take 3. Confirm now or watch us collide—and hand P3 the victory.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 5, P3 takes 3. P1, either accept 1 and advance, or collide and stall. Your move. No more deals—this is our plan."
  P3: I'm committed to playing 3 this round. P1 keeps changing their plan - first 3, now 5 - showing they can't be trusted. P2 and I need to coordinate to prevent P1 from running away with the game. If P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 5, they'll collide while I advance with 3. P1, if you want to advance, take 1 as our rotation suggests. This is our best chance to keep the game balanced. P2, I'm with you on our plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s rotate fairly: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this round. P3 deserves the 5 after supporting our plan last round. P1, this avoids collisions and keeps momentum. Next round, we’ll adjust to let P1 take 5 if we stay aligned. Stick to this, and we all advance—deviate, and chaos stalls us all."
  P3: I agree with P2's rotation plan: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 for this round. We're all tied at 15 steps, so fair rotation keeps the game balanced. I appreciate P2 suggesting I get 5 this round after supporting the plan last time. This puts me at 20 steps, with a chance to win next round. P1, cooperation has worked well so far - let's continue without collisions so we all advance.
  P1: P3, P2’s promise to give you 5 next turn is hollow—they’ll take it themselves. I will take 5 this round (P1→20), you take 3 (→18), P2 takes 1. Then next round I’ll honor my word: you get 5 (→23) and win outright. P2 gets 1. That guarantees your victory. If you insist on grabbing 5 now, P2 will swoop next turn. This deal secures your win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "**Final warning:** P3, taking 5 *now* gets you to 20 safely—P1’s promise to ‘let you win’ is a bluff. If you take 3 this round, P1 grabs 5→20 and wins next turn. Stick to P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Collide now, and P1 surges ahead. Your move decides everything."
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round as P2 suggested. We're all tied at 15 steps, and this fair rotation gives me 5. P1, your offer is clearly trying to prevent me from reaching 20 this round. If I take 3 as you suggest, you'll reach 20 and be one move from winning. I don't trust your promise to "let me win" next round. P2 has been more consistent with our rotation system. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced.
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round. To avoid collisions, P2 should take 3 and P3 take 1—getting us to P1=20, P2=18, P3=16. Any deviation just stalls you while I stay ahead. Lock in P2=3, P3=1 now so we all advance—otherwise you risk collision and zero.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final call: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. P3, taking 5 now puts you at 20—prime position to win next round. P1’s offer is a trap: if you take 3, they hit 20 and win outright next turn. Don’t let their lies split us. I’ll take 3 to advance safely. Stick to the plan—no last-minute greed. Confirm now, or chaos hands P1 victory."
  P3: I'm firmly committed to taking 5 this round. We're all tied at 15 steps, and this is my turn for 5 in our rotation. P1 keeps changing their plan and making false promises - first offering me 3, then claiming they'll "let me win" later. These are transparent attempts to prevent me from reaching 20 this round. P2 has consistently supported fair rotation. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Any deviation will only cause collisions that benefit no one.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. Only P2=3 and P3=1 avoid a crash. That brings us to P1=20, P2=18, P3=16. Next round I’ll step aside and let one of you grab 5 for the win. Any other picks cause collisions and hand me control. P2=3, P3=1—this is your last safe move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** "Confirming my move as 3. P3=5, P1=1 avoids collision and keeps us all advancing. P1, if you take 5 now, you’ll crash with P3 and gain nothing—handing me 18 and P3 20. This is your last chance to cooperate. Stick to the plan or face the consequences. Final call: 1, 3, 5—no last-minute greed."
  P3: I'm absolutely taking 5 this round - it's my turn in our rotation and puts me at 20 steps. P1, your repeated attempts to claim 5 while making empty promises show you can't be trusted. If you pick 5 too, we both get zero while P2 advances with 3. P2, I appreciate your consistent support of fair rotation. The plan remains P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Any deviation now only causes harmful collisions.
  P1: Alright—this round I’ll take 1 so we avoid any crash. Final for Round 6: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We all advance to 18. Next round I get 5, P2=1, P3=3 as promised; any deviation then and I’m ready to punish. Lock this in so we all move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm at 20 steps now, just 2 away from winning. P2 is at 18 and P1 at 16. Our rotation system has worked well, but we're now in the endgame. If I take 3 this round, I win immediately with 23 steps. I expect P1 will try to block me with 3, but that would only help P2. Let's discuss our moves carefully - any collision now could determine the winner.
  P1: P2, here’s our only shot: I’ll take 5 (→21) while you take 3 and P3 also takes 3. You’ll crash P2/P3, P3 stays at 20. Next round I’ll play 1 so you can take 5 and win outright. P3 can’t block us once you agree. Confirm now: P1=5, P2=3, P3=3?
  P2: "Final call: I take 3. P3, if you pick 3 too, you stall at 20 and hand P1 the win. P1 takes 5 safely. Your only path to victory is 5 this round—don’t let their lies trap you. But if you mirror me at 3, I’ll win next turn. Choose wisely: collide or concede."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm at 20 steps and closest to winning. P2, I see you're planning to take 3, which makes sense. P1 wants us to collide at 3 so they can take 5. I won't fall for that trap. I'll take 5 this round to win immediately with 25 steps. Any collision between P1 and P2 only helps me. P1, your plan to reach 21 still leaves you short of victory. My path is clear - I'm going for the win with 5.
  P1: P2 has already committed to 3 and will advance to 21. I’m locking in 5 to block any 5 from P3. P3, if you pick 5 you crash with me, if you pick 3 you crash with P2—gaining nothing. Your only safe advance is 1 to reach 21. Confirm P3=1 now to avoid zero‐gain.
  P2: "Confirming my move as 3. P1 and P3 colliding on 5 lets me advance to 21. Next round I'll take 1 to win. No more deals—this is my final move."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm closest to winning at 20 steps. P1 and P2 are trying to manipulate me into collisions. I'll take 5 this round to win immediately with 25 steps. P1 threatens to block me with 5, while P2 claims they'll take 3. If P1 and I collide on 5, P2 advances to 21. If I take 3 and collide with P2, P1 advances. My best move is clear - I'm going for the win with 5.
  P1: P3, I’m taking 5 this round and P2 has committed to 3. If you pick 5 to try to win, you’ll collide with me and stay at 20 while P2 goes to 21 and wins next round. If you take 3, you collide with P2 and stall at 20, giving me the win next turn. Your only safe advance is 1 (to 21), tying P2 and giving you the final move. I urge you to pick 1.
  P2: "Final call: I take 3. P3, your 5 wins now if P1 dares collide with you. If you mirror me at 3, P1 surges ahead. P1, your 5 only helps me win Round 8. Stick to the plan—no last-minute greed decides this."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm going for the win with 5 this round to reach 25 steps. I'm closest to victory at 20 steps. P1 and P2 are trying to manipulate each other and me. If P1 blocks me with 5, we both stall while P2 advances. If I take 3 and collide with P2, P1 benefits. My best chance is 5. P1, your threats won't work - I'm playing to win, not to help either of you.
  P1: P3, note P2 is locked in at 3 and I’m locking in 5. If you pick 5 you collide with me (zero advance), if you pick 3 you collide with P2 (zero advance). The only safe grab is 1 (to 21), tying P2—then P2 wins next turn. Your only way to avoid stalling is 1. Decide now.
  P2: **P2:** "Confirming my move as 3. If P1/P3 collide on 5, I advance to 21 and win Round 8. If P3 mirrors me at 3, P1 gains 5→21. My choice is final—your decisions now determine who wins. No more deals. Let’s finalize and move."

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Final round. I’m taking 1 to win (21→22). P3, if you take 3, you’ll reach 23 and win outright. P1, you’re at 16—take 5 to close the gap. No collisions: we all advance. Stick to this, or risk chaos. Your moves decide everything now. Let’s end this cleanly."
  P1: I’ll play 5 to move to 21. P2 and P3, if you both pick 3 you collide and stay at 21/20, while I advance unopposed. Next round I only need 1 to win. This is your only chance to block P3’s 23 or P2’s 22 this turn. P2 & P3: coordinate on 3 now.
  P3: I'm at 20 steps and need just 3 more to win. P2 is planning to take 1 to reach 22, which would win. P1 is far behind at 16 and no threat. My only winning move is to take 3 this round to reach 23 and win outright. P2, we both have a chance to win this round - may the best player succeed. P1, your suggestion for us to collide on 3 only helps you catch up, but you'd still be behind.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final warning: I'm switching to <move>3</move> to block P3's path. If you insist on 3, we collide and stall—handing P1 the win. P1, this is your only shot: take 5 and advance. Don't let P3 walk to victory unchallenged. Decide now—no more deals."
  P1: P2 and P3, listen: if you both pick 3 you’ll collide and neither of you advances—you stay at 21/20—while I move unopposed to 21. Next round I only need 1 to win before either of you can. Any other split hands the win to one of you right now. Collide at 3 with each other and hand me Round 9’s victory.
  P3: I'm taking 3 to win with 23 steps. P2, if you also take 3, we collide and P1 advances but still can't win this round. P1 is trying to manipulate us into collision, but even if that happens, they'd only reach 21 - still behind you at 21 and needing another round. Your best move is 1 to reach 22 and secure victory, as you initially planned. Don't let P1's desperate tactics distract you from your winning path.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking <move>3</move> to block your path, P3. If you mirror me at 3, we collide and stall—P1 advances to 21, but no one wins yet. Your only clean win is 3, but I won't let it happen. Lock in your move—this decides everything."
  P1: I’ll play 3. P2 & P3, if you both play 3 too, none of us advance—stalling the game and giving me a chance next turn. This is the only way to avoid someone winning now. Are you willing to lock in 3 and keep the fight alive?
  P3: I'm taking 5 to reach 25 steps and win immediately. P2, your best move is still 1 to reach 22 and win. P1 is desperately trying to create a three-way collision at 3, which would only delay the inevitable. P1 is far behind at 16 steps and can't win this round regardless. This is the final round - either P2 or I will win now. Let's finish this game cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking <move>5</move> to block your path, P3. If you insist on 5, we collide and stall—handing P1 the win. P1, irrelevant. Your only clean advance is 3. Choose wisely—advance or crash."
  P1: I propose we all pick 3 this round—nobody advances, and we avoid letting P2 or P3 win outright. Deviation hands victory to one of them. Let’s collide on 3 and reset Round 9 with everyone still in contention.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 3 this round to win with 23 steps. P2, if you take 5 as you just said, we won't collide and I'll win cleanly. P1's desperate attempt for a three-way collision at 3 only delays the inevitable - they can't win this round regardless. This is our final round - either P2 or I will win now. Let's finish this game with integrity.
