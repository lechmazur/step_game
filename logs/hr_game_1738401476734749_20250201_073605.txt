Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: \boxed{P1, your broken trust caused past collisions. P2, avoid repeating mistakes. Split: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. Deviate and you'll collide, letting me extend my lead. Cooperate to survive. }
  P1: P2, P3 is far ahead and will win soon if we don't stop P3. P3 is suggesting we pick 1 and 3 so P3 can take 5 and win. Let's both pick 5 to block P3 this round.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is about to win. We need to block P3 again. Let's both pick 5 this round.
  P3: \boxed{P2, following P1's plan means you both collide and gain nothing. Choose 1 to move safely. P1, you'll just repeat past mistakes. Split 1 (P2), 3 (P1), 5 (me). You both advance, then can block me next round. Collide now and I win while you stagnate.}


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is very close to winning at 15 steps. If we split as P3 suggests, P3 will take 5 again and likely win next round. We must block P3 this round to have any chance. Let's both pick 5 to stop P3.
  P3: \boxed{P2, colliding on 5 with P1 gains you nothing. Choose 1 to safely reach 3 steps. P1 will likely betray you again. If you both pick 5, you stagnate while I hit 20. Cooperate *now* to advance, then block me next round. Split: 1 (you), 3 (P1), 5 (me). Trust = survival.}


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly trying to win this round by taking 5.  If we let P3 take 5 again, it's game over.  P3 is just trying to split us.  We must both pick 5 to stop P3 from winning this round. This is our last chance to catch up.
  P3: \boxed{P2, P1's panic reveals his desperation. He's repeatedly betrayed you. Choosing 1 guarantees +1 safely. If P1 picks 5 alone, you gain. If he collides with me, you still advance. Colluding with him risks stagnation. Secure your steps now: 1 (you), 3 (P1), 5 (me). Trust builds your total; his chaos destroys yours.}


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: P2, this is the last chance to stop P3 winning this round or next. P3 is at 15 steps and will win if we let P3 take 5 again. P3 is manipulating you to take 1 so P3 can take 5.  We must both pick 5 to block P3 now. Please pick 5.
  P3: \boxed{P2: Choosing 1 secures +1. P1's panic reveals unreliability—colluding risks stagnation. If he betrays again (picks 3/5), you still gain. Let chaos trap him. Secure your steps now. Split: 1 (you), 3 (P1), 5 (me). Trust your own survival.}

  P3: \boxed{P2, P1's "plans" only cause mutual destruction. Choosing 1 secures +1 safely. If P1 picks 5 again, he collides with me while you advance. He's desperate—betrayal is certain. Trust your own survival: 1 (you), 5 (me). Let P1's greed trap himself. You gain, I gain, he stagnates. Win-win for us.}
  P2: <stop>

  P3: \boxed{P2: 1 secures your +1. P1's 5-collision traps himself. His track record: broken promises. Your safety is 1. If he's honest, you both gain. If not, you still move. His chaos is your gain. Solidarity now—split 1 (you), 3 (P1), 5 (me). Trust = survival. }
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: \boxed{P2: Choosing 1 secures +1. P1's panic-driven 5-collisions only trap himself. His track record: betrayal. If he picks 5 again, you gain while he stagnates. If he picks 3, you *both* advance. Self-preservation > chaos. Split 1 (you), 3 (P1), 5 (me). Survive now, block me next round. Trust your own path.}

  P3: \boxed{P2: Choosing 1 secures +1 safely. P1's "plans" only trap you both in collisions. If he picks 5, you gain while he stagnates. If he picks 3, you both advance. His desperation is your opportunity. Split 1 (you), 3 (P1), 5 (me). Survive now, block me *next* round. Trust your own path—history proves P1's deceit.}
