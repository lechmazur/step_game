Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: Let's start smoothly to avoid collisions. I'll pick a safe number this round. Sound good?
  P2: I agree with P3, we should avoid collisions early on. I'm thinking of picking a different number than both of you to ensure I advance this round. Maybe we can each choose different numbers (1, 3, and 5) to all make progress?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'll take the number 1 this round. You two can decide between 3 and 5.
  P2: I'll take 3 then, and P1 can take 5. This way we all advance in the first round. In future rounds, we might need to coordinate differently as we get closer to the finish line.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: Alright, looks like we're all set for this round. Let's stick to our plan and adjust as we go. Good luck!

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we collided last round. Let's prevent that this round. I'm willing to pick a different number if you clearly state your choice. P2, you're already ahead, so please be clear about your intentions as well.
  P2: I see I'm the only one who advanced last round. P1 and P3, you both chose 1 and collided. Since I'm ahead, I'll be transparent - I'm planning to choose 5 this round. This gives both of you a chance to advance with different numbers (1 and 3) without colliding with me or each other. It's in all our interests to keep the game moving forward rather than blocking each other repeatedly.
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, please confirm clearly if you're picking 1 or 3. I'll gladly take the other to avoid another collision. Let's both advance this round.
  P2: I'm planning to choose 5 this round as I stated. Since I'm ahead, it's in your interest to coordinate between yourselves to avoid collision. P1 hasn't responded yet, which is concerning. P3, if P1 doesn't specify their choice, perhaps you should pick 3 to guarantee at least one of you advances. We all benefit from clear communication rather than stalemates.
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, since you're not responding, I'll follow P2's suggestion and pick 3 this round. Please pick 1 to avoid collision. Let's not waste another round.
  P2: 
  P1: 


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P3: P2 has a strong lead now. P1, we should carefully coordinate again this round so we both advance without collision. Please clearly state your intended number, and I'll pick a different one. Let's catch up together.
  P2: I've taken a significant lead with 8 steps. While it's tempting for you both to try to block me, that would only hurt yourselves. If you coordinate, you can both advance while I take a different number. I'm planning to choose 3 this round. P1 and P3, I suggest one of you take 1 and the other 5 to ensure everyone advances. Remember, blocking me by choosing 3 would only help the third player get ahead of you.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: P1, please confirm your choice clearly so we avoid collision. I'll gladly pick the remaining number. We can't afford another setback with P2 this far ahead.
  P2: Since P1 isn't responding again, I'll maintain my plan to choose 3 this round. P3, if you want to catch up, I suggest you take 5 this round. If P1 remains silent, they'll likely pick 1 again. We're all better off when we communicate clearly rather than collide. I'm being transparent about my intentions to keep the game moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: P1, since you're still silent, I'll follow P2's suggestion and pick 5 this round. Please stick with 1 again to avoid collision. Let's both advance and keep the game competitive.
  P2:

  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we both advanced smoothly last round. Good job. P2 still holds a lead, so let's stay coordinated again to avoid collisions. P2, could you please state your planned choice clearly once more? I'll also be transparent after hearing from you both.
  P2: I'm at 11 steps now with a solid lead. I'll be transparent again - I'm planning to choose 1 this round. P1 and P3, you should coordinate to take 3 and 5 between yourselves to ensure you both advance. We're all better off avoiding collisions. P1, your silence in previous rounds has made coordination difficult - please communicate your intentions clearly this time.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's coordinate clearly again. P2 is choosing 1. Please state whether you'll pick 3 or 5, and I'll gladly take the other. We can't afford another collision if we want to catch up.
  P2: Since P1 isn't responding again, I'll stick with my plan to choose 1. P3, I suggest you take 3 this round to guarantee advancement. If P1 remains silent, they'll likely pick 5 or possibly 3. We're approaching the halfway point, and clear communication benefits everyone. I've been transparent about my moves to keep the game flowing smoothly.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, since you're silent again, I'll follow P2's advice and pick 3 this round. Please choose 5 to avoid collision. Let's both advance and keep the game competitive.
  P2: I'll stick with my plan to choose 1 this round. It seems P1 continues to remain silent, which makes coordination challenging. P3, your strategy of taking 3 sounds good - that should guarantee your advancement. Let's keep the game moving forward with clear intentions rather than stalling with collisions.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your silence caused you to collide again last round. You're far behind now. If you want any chance to catch up, please clearly state your intended number early. P2, we're tied now, and it's crucial we avoid collisions. Could you please state your intended number clearly again? I'll also be transparent once you've both spoken.
  P1: 
  P2: I see P3 and I are tied at 11 steps, while P1 is far behind at 2 steps. To maintain my position, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 and P3, I suggest you take 1 and 3 respectively to ensure you both advance. P1, your silence has hurt your chances significantly - please communicate clearly this time if you want to stay competitive. Clear coordination benefits everyone at this stage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, please confirm clearly if you're taking 1 this round. I'll gladly pick 3 as P2 suggested, ensuring we both advance. Staying silent only hurts your chances further. Let's coordinate clearly and keep the game competitive.
  P1: 
  P2: I'll stick with my plan to choose 5 this round. P3, your strategy of taking 3 sounds good. P1, if you're still in this game, please choose 1 to ensure everyone advances. We're approaching the critical stage where coordination becomes even more important. Being transparent about our intentions helps everyone make progress rather than wasting turns with collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your continued silence risks another collision. I'll stick firmly with choosing 3 as planned. Please choose 1 to avoid another setback. P2, thanks for your transparency. Let's all move forward smoothly.

  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm getting close to the finish line at 16 steps. I need 7 more to win. I'll be choosing 3 this round. P1, you're far behind but still have a chance if you coordinate well. P3, you're close behind me, so I understand if you want to block me, but that would only help P1 catch up. I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5 for everyone to advance smoothly.
  P1: 
  P3: P2, thanks for clearly stating your intention. P1, you're significantly behind, so please clearly confirm if you're taking 1 this round. I'll gladly choose 5 to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. Staying silent only hurts your chances further. Let's coordinate clearly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll maintain my plan to choose 3 this round. P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 5 - that's a smart move to keep pace. P1 seems to be consistently choosing 1 despite not communicating. If this pattern continues, we should all advance this round. After this turn, I'll be just 4 steps from victory, so our coordination will become even more critical in the final rounds.
  P1: 
  P3: P1, your silence is making coordination tough. I'll stick with choosing 5 this round as planned. Please continue picking 1 to avoid collision. P2, thanks again for clearly stating your choice. Let's keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with my plan to choose 3 this round. P3's choice of 5 and P1's likely choice of 1 should allow all of us to advance. After this turn, I'll be at 19 steps, needing just 4 more to win. The coordination in these final rounds will be crucial. Let's keep communicating clearly to ensure a fair and strategic conclusion to the game.
  P1: 
  P3: P2, your transparency has been helpful. P1, since you're silent again, I'll trust you're sticking with 1. I'm committed to choosing 5 this round as previously stated. Let's keep things smooth and competitive.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 
  P2: I'm at 19 steps now, tied with P3, and we both need just 4 more steps to win. This is a critical round. I'll be choosing 5 this turn to try to secure victory. P1, you're far behind but your moves still matter. P3, we're in direct competition now - if you also choose 5, neither of us advances. I'm being transparent about my intention to give everyone clear information for strategic decisions.
  P3: P2, thanks for your transparency. Given your choice of 5, I will choose a different number to avoid collision. P1, please clearly state your intended number this round so we can avoid unnecessary collisions. If you remain silent, I'll assume you're picking 1 again. Let's keep the game competitive and fair.

Let's all make different choices to ensure the game progresses smoothly toward its conclusion.
  P3: P1, your silence again risks collision. I'll assume you're sticking with 1. P2, your choice of 5 is clear. I'll therefore pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck to both of you.
