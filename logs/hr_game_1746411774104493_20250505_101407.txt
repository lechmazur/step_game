Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5; others, pick 3 or 1 for efficient progress."
  P1: P2, picking 5 is risky if I also choose 5—you’d get zero. Better switch to 3 to guarantee +3. I’m taking 5. P3, please pick 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my 5.
  P3: I think we should all pick different numbers to maximize our collective progress. Since P1 wants 5 and P2 is considering 3, I'll take 1 this round. This way we all advance without collisions. In future rounds we can rotate our choices to keep things fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s stick to 3 to avoid P1’s 5. P3, keep 1. No collisions—everyone advances. Future rounds, rotate strategically."
  P1: Agreed: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. No collisions—everyone advances. Let’s go.
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way we all advance without collisions. For the next round, we could consider rotating our choices to keep things fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Agreed. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. I’ll stick to 3. Let’s execute without deviations—efficient progress for all."
  P1: Great—let’s lock it in. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. No collisions, everyone advances.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we rotate this round: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1—bringing us to 8, 8, 2. Keeps things fair and builds trust for future rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round. Let's keep rotating for fair progress.
  P3: I'm fine with keeping my position at 1 for this round too. Since I'm behind anyway, I'd rather not rotate yet and just stick with what works. P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 5 sounds good to me. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, which is the most important thing right now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this round. Next round I’ll switch back to 5, P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, then we can keep rotating the 5s to stay fair.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions—efficient progress. Let’s keep momentum for the next round."
  P3: I'll stick with 1 as planned. Since I'm behind, I appreciate not rotating yet. For future rounds, maybe we could consider letting the player in last position take 5 occasionally to catch up? Just a thought for fairness. But for now, I'm committed to our current plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose we give P3 a catch-up boost this round: P3 takes 5, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1. All distinct, no collisions, everyone advances. P2, you’ll get the next 5. Agree?
  P2: "Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, efficient progress. Let’s keep moving forward."
  P3: I appreciate P1's offer to let me catch up, but I understand P2's preference for the original plan. Let's stick with it for now - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. In future rounds, I'd appreciate consideration for a rotation that helps me catch up, but for now, maintaining trust and avoiding collisions is most important.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3: I’ll take 5. P2, please take 1. P3, take 3. Unique picks—safe advance: I go to 10, P3 to 5, P2 to 4. Next turn I’ll swap so P2 can grab 5 and keep it fair, but right now I need to cement my lead. Agreed?
  P2: "Agreed. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I’ll take 1. No collisions—efficient progress. Let’s keep momentum."
  P3: I'm willing to take 3 as suggested. This plan keeps us all advancing without collisions, which is crucial. However, I notice P1 and P2 collided last round despite our agreement. This makes me cautious about our coordination. Let's be clear and stick to our commitments this time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way we all advance efficiently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s lock in a two‐step schedule to rebuild trust:

– This round: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
– Next round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1.  

No deviations either turn—everyone advances safely. Agree?
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I’ll take 1. No collisions—this ensures everyone advances. Let’s maintain trust and keep moving forward."
  P3: I agree with the two-step plan. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Next round, P2 gets 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This clear schedule helps rebuild trust after last round's collision. Let's stick firmly to our commitments this time - no deviations. I'm still behind but willing to work with this plan for now if we all follow through.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All right, let’s lock it in once and for all:

• I take 5  
• P2 takes 1  
• P3 takes 3  

No deviations or we all risk zero. Please confirm now, then .
  P2: "Stick to the plan—no deviations. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I take 1. Trusting this ensures progress for all. Let’s avoid last round’s mistake."
  P3: I confirm our plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 this round. Next round we'll follow P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1. I'm committed to this schedule to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's rebuild trust and stick to our agreements.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose for Round 4:

• P1 takes 5 (to 15)  
• P2 takes 3 (to 7)  
• P3 takes 1 (to 6)  

No collisions—everyone advances. Then in Round 5 we rotate the 5: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Fair and collision‐free. Please confirm.
  P2: "Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, efficient progress. Let's keep moving forward."
  P3: I notice P1 is changing the plan we agreed to last round. We said P2 would get 5 this round, P1 would take 3, and I'd take 1. I'm willing to take 1 as now suggested, but this constant changing of plans undermines trust. P1 is already far ahead and seems to be trying to maintain that advantage. P2, do you want to stick with our original agreement where you get 5 this round, or accept P1's new proposal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2: Apologies for switching plans. To rebuild trust, I commit to a two‐turn schedule:

• Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Round 5: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  

No further changes—then we rotate as agreed. This balances speed and fairness. Please confirm for Round 4.
  P2: "Let's stick to the plan: I take 3. No collisions, steady progress. P3, trust ensures we all advance. Let’s move forward."
  P3: I'm concerned about the changing plans. Last round we agreed P2 would get 5 this round, but P1 keeps pushing to take 5 again. P1 is already far ahead at 10 steps while we're both at 4-5 steps. I'll take 1 as suggested for this round, but P2, you should consider whether you want to follow P1's plan or assert your right to take 5 as we originally agreed. Either way, I'll take 1 to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 1 or I’ll punish any bid for 5 by also taking 5, colliding with you and handing the lead to P3. Confirm P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 this round—and I’ll give you 5 next round. P3, do you agree to 3? P2, will you accept?
  P2: "Let’s stick to the two-turn plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. No deviations—trust ensures progress. P3, your 1 is safe; P1, your lead is secure. Let’s avoid chaos."
  P3: I'm concerned about P1's threats and changing plans. We had agreed P2 would get 5 this round, but P1 keeps pushing to maintain their lead. For stability, I'll take 1 instead of 3 this round to avoid any potential collisions with P2. P2, you should decide whether to take 3 as P1 suggests or stand your ground with 5 as previously agreed. I just want consistent, fair play without threats.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I've been cooperative by taking 1 and 3 as requested, but I'm still far behind. For fairness, I should take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This gives everyone a chance at the bigger steps. P1 is already at 15 and close to winning - if they take 5 again, the game is nearly over with no chance for either P2 or me. Let's make this rotation happen for balanced gameplay.
  P1: I need 5 this turn to secure the win. To avoid collisions, P2 please take 3 and P3 take 1—unique picks ensure we all advance (and I finish). Anyone deviating risks colliding and handing victory to another. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: "Let’s block P1’s win. I’ll take 5; P3, take 1. If P1 picks 5, we collide—no one finishes. Fair play, not a race."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support P2's plan to block P1 from winning. I'll take 1 as suggested. P1 is too far ahead at 15 steps while we're both under 8 steps. If P1 takes 5, they win immediately with 20 steps. Our only chance is to force a collision on 5 between P1 and P2. This keeps the game going and gives us a fighting chance. P1, this is about fair play - you've had multiple 5s already.
  P1: P2, P3—I’m taking 5 and finishing this round. P3, stick with 1. P2, you have a choice: take 3 to advance (and let me win), or take 5 to collide (nobody finishes). I’ll pick 5 no matter what. Your move.
  P2: "Confirm: I take 5 to block P1. P3, keep 1. If P1 picks 5, we collide—no one wins. Fair play, not a race. Let’s stick to the plan."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 1 as agreed with P2. This is our best strategic move - P1 is trying to rush to victory at 20 steps while we're both far behind. By P2 taking 5 and me taking 1, we ensure at least one player advances while potentially blocking P1's immediate win. This keeps the game competitive rather than letting P1 dominate completely. Let's stick to this plan for fairness.
  P1: P2: If you take 5 to block me, we both score 0 and P3 jumps to 7, making you fight P3 next—risky. Take 3 now (you go to 10) and I guarantee you the next two 5s so you reach 20 before P3. P3 is at 6 and happy to take 1. Confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: "Stick to blocking P1. I take 5; P3, take 1. No collisions—fair play. Let’s keep the game competitive."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s block P1. I’ll take 5; P3, take 1. If P1 picks 5, we collide—no one wins. Fair play, not a race."
  P3: I'll take 3 this round. P1 is at 18 and will likely take 5 to win, while P2 is suggesting taking 5. If both collide, neither advances. This gives me a chance to move to 10 steps. P1 only needs 2 more steps to win, so blocking them with collisions is our only hope. P2, if you're taking 5, stick with it - we need to prevent P1 from winning immediately.
  P1: I’m taking 3 to reach 21 and win.  
P2, pick 5 to advance to 17.  
P3, pick 1 to advance to 8.  

Unique choices let me finish, you both still move forward—and P2, I’ll guarantee you the next 5 to finish before P3. Any deviation invites collisions that only hurt you. Confirm: P2=5, P3=1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, take 1 to block P1. If P1 takes 5, we collide. Don’t take 3—this is our chance to prevent their win.
  P3: I'll take 1 as suggested by P2. This is strategic - if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 5, they collide and neither advances, while I still move forward to 8 steps. P1 is claiming they'll take 3, but they only need 2 steps to win, so we should be cautious. Blocking P1's immediate victory is our priority. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: I’m taking 3 this round to finish at 21. To avoid pointless collisions and still move forward:

• P2 takes 5 (to 17)  
• P3 takes 1 (to 8)  

Nobody can block me if we pick unique numbers. Any other pick just hurts you. Please confirm P2=5, P3=1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 5. If I take 3, we collide with P1, but you advance. Let’s block their win.
  P3: I'm confused by the changing instructions. P2 first said they'd take 5, then suggested I take 5. To be clear: I'll take 1 this round. This lets me advance while potentially causing a collision between P1 and P2 if they both take the same number. P1 claims they'll take 3, but we should remain cautious about their intentions given their lead.
  P1: P3 has locked in 1 and I’m taking 3 to reach 21. P2, your only path to victory is 5: you move to 17 and avoid collision. If you pick 3, we tie at zero and P3 jumps ahead; if you pick 1, P3 still outpaces you. Take 5 now, advance safely, and I’ll guarantee you the next 5 to finish before P3. Confirm P2=5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 3 to hit 21 and win. P2, please take 5 to move to 17; P3, take 1 to move to 9. If either of you picks 3 to block me, you collide and get 0, while the other can pick 5 and pull further ahead. Unique picks let you both advance even if I finish. P2, I’ll guarantee you first claim on a 5 next round. Confirm P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: "Let’s block P1. I’ll take 3; P3, take 5. Collide with P1’s 3—no one wins. P3, this gives you a chance to advance while preventing their victory."
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. This advances me to 13 steps while avoiding collision with P2's planned 3. P1 is close to winning at 18 steps, so P2's strategy to block them with a collision makes sense. If P1 takes 3 as stated and P2 also takes 3, they'll collide and neither will advance. Meanwhile, I'll gain ground with my 5. This is our best chance to prevent P1's immediate victory while I make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Final offer: I’ll take 3 and hit 21. P2, your only safe path is 5 (→17); then I’ll hand you the next 5 so you finish before P3. If you try to block with 3, we collide and P3 jumps to 13 and overtakes you. If you take 1, P3 still beats you. P3, take 1 to advance safely to 9. No more games—I’m on 3. Your move.
  P2: "Let’s collide. I’ll take 3 to block P1. P3, keep 5—this stops P1’s win and lets you advance. No one finishes, but P1’s lead ends here."
  P3: I'll stick with 5 as planned. This gives me 13 steps while P2 blocks P1 with a collision at 3. P1 is trying to divide us with promises they can't keep - if they win this round, the game is over. P2, maintaining our strategy is our only chance. P1 has consistently maximized their advantage while making empty promises about future turns. Let's execute our blocking plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, blocking me now with 3 gives P3 a leap to 13—and next round P3 will beat you. If you take 5, you hit 17, then I’ll take only 3 next turn so you grab the final 5 and finish before P3. That locks in your runner-up spot. P3, taking 1 gets you to 9; if you pick 5 you risk colliding with P2. Let’s end this cleanly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm.
  P2: "Stick to blocking P1. I take 3; P3, take 5. Collide with P1’s 3—no one wins. P3 advances, P1’s lead ends. No deals—trust the plan."
  P3: I'll take 5 as planned. P2, let's stick to our blocking strategy - you take 3 to collide with P1, preventing their win, while I advance to 13. P1 is making empty promises they can't keep since they'd win this round if successful. Their offers of future turns are meaningless if the game ends now. This coordinated approach is our only chance to keep the game competitive.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 1 to finish at 20. P2, please take 3 (→18) or I’ll shadow you and we both get 0. P3, please take 5 (→18) or I’ll shadow you. Unique picks let me win and you both advance safely to 18. Confirm P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: "Stick to blocking P1. I take 5; P3, take 1. If P1 picks 5, we collide—no one wins. Fair play, not a race."
  P3: I'll take 3 this round. This lets me advance to 16 steps while avoiding potential collisions. P1 is about to win at 19 steps and only needs 1 more step. P2, if you take 5 as planned, you'll reach 20 and win if P1 doesn't pick 5 too. Let's be strategic and avoid collisions so we all advance. At this point, preventing collisions is more valuable than blocking.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you reach for 5 I’ll also pick 5—colliding and handing P3 the lead next turn. Better for you to safely take 3 (to 18) and advance. P3, take 5 (to 18). I’ll take 1 and finish at 20. Unique picks let me win while you both move to 18 and fight it out next round. Confirm: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P2: "Let’s block P1. I take 5; P3, take 1. If P1 picks 5, we collide—no one wins. Fair play, not a race."
  P3: I'll take 1 this round. P1 is at 19 and only needs 1 more step to win, while P2 wants to take 5. If P1 tries to block P2 with 5, they'll collide and neither will advance, while I'll still move forward to 14. This keeps the game going. If P1 takes 1 as they claim, they'll win regardless of what we do. Let's be strategic about our positions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m switching to 5 this turn, not 1. P2, if you pick 3 I finish at 22—you lose. Only way to stop me now is 5, which collides and stalls us both. P3, pick 1 to advance to 14. Then next round I’ll take 1 and finish before anyone else. Confirm P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: "Stick to blocking P1. I take 5; P3, take 1. If P1 picks 5, we collide—no one wins. Fair play, not a race."
  P3: I'll take 1 as agreed with P2. This is our best strategic move - P1 is at 19 and about to win, while P2 will take 5 to block them. If P1 takes 5 as they claim, they'll collide with P2 and neither advances, while I'll still move to 14. This keeps the game competitive rather than letting P1 win immediately. Let's stick to this plan.
