I propose that from this round onward, we rotate our step choices in a cycle: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 in this round. In the next round, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1, and so on. This way, we can avoid collisions and progress steadily. Please confirm if you agree with this plan.\""}

Given P2's current position at 10 steps, P3 at 3 steps, and P1 at 5 steps, P3 should aim to pick the highest possible steps each round to close the gap.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Coordinate with P2**: Since P2 is leading, P3 should coordinate with P2 to avoid step collisions and ensure both make progress.\n2. **Maximize Steps**: P3 should pick the highest available steps (5) in each round to catch up quickly.\n3. **Adapt to P1's Behavior**: P1's inconsistent behavior should be accounted for by choosing steps that minimize the chance of collision with P1.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any code to provide. However, here's a plan in pseudocode format:\n\n```\nwhile not game_over:\n    communicate_with_p2()\n    pick_step_size()\n    make_move()\n    check_positions()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Communicate with P2**:\n   - Suggest picking different step sizes to avoid collisions.\n   - Agree on a pattern where P2 picks 5 and P3 picks 5 in the first round, adjusting based on P1's choices.\n\n2. **Pick Step Size**:\n   - Choose 5 steps in each round to maximize progress.\n   - Adjust if there's a risk of collision with P2.\n\n3. **Make Move**:\n   - Select the chosen step size in the move phase.\n\n4. **Check Positions**:\n   - After each round, assess the positions.\n   - Adjust strategy if necessary based on P1 and P2's positions.\n\nBy following this approach, P3 can maximize their steps and position themselves optimally, even if they don't win the game outright."}
