Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3. Let's start with a friendly conversation. I think we should all choose a different number to avoid collision and make the game more interesting. What do you think? Should we try to coordinate our moves or play it individually?
  P1: I agree, P2. Coordinating our moves could make the game more strategic and fun. How about we start with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5? This way, we all advance without collision. Let's see how it goes and adjust our strategy as needed. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. However, I think we should also consider how we can position ourselves for a stronger advantage later on. If P1 chooses 1 and P2 chooses 3, I could choose 5 as suggested. That way, we all move forward. But we should also keep in mind that we need to be flexible in future turns. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with both of you that coordination is a good starting point. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to P1's initial suggestion. Instead of assigning numbers based on player order, why not assign them based on the number of steps we want to take? For example, if we all want to advance 3 steps, we could have P1 choose 1, P3 choose 5, and I choose 3. This way, we're not limited by our player order and can adapt our strategy more easily in future turns. What do you think?
  P1: I like P2's suggestion to assign numbers based on desired steps rather than player order. Let's try that for this round. If we all agree to advance 3 steps, I'll choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and P2 can choose 3. This approach gives us flexibility for future turns. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this plan?
  P3: I appreciate the collaborative spirit, but I want to emphasize that while coordination is great, we also need to think about our individual positions. If we all choose different numbers, it might benefit us in the long run. I suggest we stick to the original plan of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I’ll choose 5. This way, we all advance without collision, but we should remain open to adjusting our strategies in future rounds based on how the game unfolds. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's emphasis on individual positioning. While coordination is beneficial, we should also consider our own long-term strategies. I propose we stick to the original plan of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this round. However, I'd like to suggest that we revisit our strategy after this round and consider adjusting our choices based on the game's progression. Let's keep an open mind and adapt as needed to maximize our chances of winning. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with sticking to the original plan for this round: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's all advance without collision. After this round, we should reassess our strategies to ensure we're positioning ourselves for a win. Flexibility will be key moving forward. What are your thoughts on how we should adjust our approach after this initial move?
  P3: I appreciate the collaborative approach we've established. I think sticking to our plan of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and I’ll choose 5 is solid for this round. However, I want to emphasize the importance of being adaptable in future rounds. After this round, let's carefully evaluate how our choices impact our positions and be ready to adjust our strategies to maximize our chances of winning. Looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "I agree that we should stick to the original plan for this round. However, I'd like to propose that we establish a way to communicate our intentions for future rounds without revealing our exact moves. Perhaps we can use a simple code or signal to indicate whether we plan to choose a high, medium, or low number. This way, we can maintain some level of coordination while still keeping our exact moves private. What do you both think?"
  P1: I like P2's idea of using a code or signal for future rounds. Let's use 'H' for high (5), 'M' for medium (3), and 'L' for low (1) to indicate our general intentions without revealing our exact moves. For this round, we'll stick to the plan: I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. After this round, we can start using the signals to coordinate more effectively. What do you think?
  P3: I think we have a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate, I will choose 5, P1 will choose 1, and P2 will choose 3. After this round, I suggest we evaluate our positions and consider using the signals we discussed to coordinate better for future rounds. This way, we can adapt our strategies while still keeping some element of surprise. Looking forward to seeing how this round goes!


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion for this round. Let's stick to the plan and make our moves accordingly. After this round, we can reassess our positions and start using the signals we discussed to coordinate better for future rounds. I'm looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds! I'll stop here and let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. After we make our moves, let's carefully review our positions and start using the 'H', 'M', 'L' signals next round to enhance our coordination. I believe this approach will give us a strategic edge while maintaining flexibility. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out and adapting our strategy accordingly.
  P3: I think we've established a solid plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'll be choosing 5, P1 will choose 1, and P2 will choose 3. After this move, let's make sure to evaluate our positions and be ready to use the 'H', 'M', 'L' signals for future coordination. This will help us adapt and strategize better as the game progresses. I'm looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds! If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we had a good start to the game, and our coordination helped us all advance without collision. For this round, I'd like to propose that we continue using the 'H', 'M', 'L' signals to indicate our general intentions. Since P3 is currently in the lead, I'll choose a medium number to maintain a safe distance. I'll signal 'M' for this round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we continue with a similar strategy or adjust our approaches?
  P3: I agree that our coordination has worked well so far. For this round, I will signal 'H' for high, as I want to make a significant move to catch up. However, I suggest we remain flexible in our approach and reassess after this round. It's crucial to keep an eye on each other's positions and adapt our strategies accordingly. What do you both think about this plan?
  P1: I agree with using the 'H', 'M', 'L' signals for better coordination. For this round, I'll signal 'L' to maintain a steady pace and avoid collisions. P3, since you're in the lead, your 'H' signal makes sense, but let's keep an eye on the gap between us. P2, your 'M' choice seems strategic. Let's continue to adapt and reassess after this round to ensure we're all positioned well for the win. Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think our signals are a good start, but we should also consider the potential risks of collision. Since P3 is signaling 'H' and I'm signaling 'M', there's a chance we might collide if we both choose the same number. To mitigate this, I propose that we establish a secondary signal to indicate whether we're willing to take a risk or play it safe. For example, we could use 'R' for risk or 'S' for safe. This way, we can better coordinate our moves and avoid unnecessary collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I like P2's idea of adding a secondary signal for risk versus safety. For this round, I will stick with my 'H' signal and aim for a significant move. However, I suggest we all communicate our willingness to take risks or play it safe. If P1 is signaling 'L' and P2 is signaling 'M', we should ensure our choices don't overlap. Let's keep evaluating our positions and adjust our strategies as needed. Looking forward to seeing what you both decide!
  P1: I support P2's suggestion for a secondary signal to manage risk. For this round, I'll signal 'L' and 'S' for low and safe, aiming to avoid collisions while keeping a steady pace. P3, your 'H' signal is noted, and P2, your 'M' choice is strategic. Let's use these signals to enhance our coordination and adapt our strategies post-round. What are your thoughts on implementing the risk/safety signals?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we're making good progress with our signals. To clarify, I'll reiterate my proposal for this round: I'll signal 'M' for medium, P3 will signal 'H' for high, and P1 will signal 'L' for low. Additionally, I suggest we use the secondary signal 'R' for risk or 'S' for safe to avoid collisions. For this round, I'll choose 'M' and 'S' to maintain a safe distance. Please confirm your signals and risk/safety intentions so we can better coordinate our moves.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion about our signals and the importance of avoiding collisions. For this round, I will stick with my 'H' signal for high and plan to take a risk. P1, your 'L' signal is safe, and P2, your 'M' signal is strategic, but we need to ensure our moves don't overlap. Let's confirm our intentions clearly to avoid any collisions. I'm looking forward to seeing how this round unfolds and how we can adapt our strategies moving forward! What are your final signals and intentions?
