Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early on. I'll take 1 this round to start cautiously. You two can decide between 3 and 5. Deal?
  P3: Agreed, P1. Let's each take distinct numbers: P1 1, P2 3, me 5. No collisions. P2, thoughts?
  P2: I accept the proposal. Taking 3 this round seems reasonable to avoid collisions and make progress. P1 and P3, let's keep our word and make this round collision-free.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're all aligned. Let's keep open communication each round to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: Let's solidify our Round 1 commitment: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Trust now prevents early setbacks. After this, we should discuss flexible strategies next round—perhaps rotating numbers to keep advancing fairly. Collaboration now benefits everyone.
  P2: Let's indeed follow our agreed plan for Round 1. After this round, we should discuss a strategy that allows for flexibility and fairness, possibly rotating our steps to minimize collisions and ensure continuous progress for all, at least until someone gets close to 21.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Propose rotating numbers each round to avoid collisions and balance progress. Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Next round, shift again. This ensures fairness and steady advancement. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation proposal for now. It seems fair and minimizes collisions. For Round 2, I'll take 5 as suggested. Let's review progress after a few rounds and adjust our strategy if needed to ensure the game remains competitive and interesting. What are P1's thoughts on this rotation strategy?
  P1: I agree with the rotation strategy for now. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. Let's keep checking in each round to ensure fairness and adjust if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Let's solidify Round 3's rotation: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. Continuing this pattern ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. If we all commit, we advance fairly each round. Agreed? If no objections, we proceed.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2 based on the rotation strategy. I will take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This way, we maintain the agreed rotation and avoid collisions, ensuring each of us advances. Shall we proceed with these moves for Round 2?
  P1: Yes, confirmed. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. Let's proceed as agreed.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good progress so far! Let's stick to the rotation we agreed on earlier: this round I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Confirming we're all aligned?
  P2: I confirm the rotation strategy for Round 3 as discussed: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains our agreed pattern and ensures collision-free progress. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 3 to keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: Agreed. Round 3 moves confirmed: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Continuing the rotation maintains fairness. Let's discuss future adjustments once someone approaches 21 to adapt strategically. Unity now maximizes collective progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We're all aligned for this round, excellent. After this move, let's carefully evaluate positions and discuss openly how to proceed. If someone approaches 21 soon, we might need to adjust strategies for fairness. Good luck!
  P2: Let's reaffirm our Round 3 moves: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation maintains balance. After this round, we should discuss potential strategy shifts, especially if someone gets close to 21, to ensure the game remains competitive and fair for all players.
  P3: **P3:** Round 3 moves locked: P1=5, P2=1, me=3. Post-Round 3, we'll all be at 9. Propose continuing rotation (R4: P1=1, P2=3, me=5) to maintain fairness. Once someone nears 21, we must adapt to avoid collisions. Let’s preemptively discuss endgame adjustments next round to ensure a competitive but fair finish.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing the rotation: Round 4 moves - P1=1, P2=3, me=5. This ensures steady, collision-free progress. Let's all confirm commitment to avoid setbacks. Post-Round 4, we should discuss endgame strategies to adapt as someone nears 21, ensuring a fair and competitive finish. Unity now maximizes our collective advancement. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, let's continue with the rotation. I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this round, let's carefully discuss how to handle the endgame fairly and competitively.
  P2: Let's confirm the rotation for Round 4 as discussed: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This maintains our pattern. After this round, we should openly discuss strategies for the endgame, considering fairness and competitiveness, especially since we're all tied and nearing the midpoint to 21.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 4 moves: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. Post this, we'll all be at 10, 12, 14. Let’s maintain rotation until Round 5 (P1=3, P2=5, me=1), then reassess. Unity now ensures steady gains. Any objections?
  P1: No objections from me. Let's stick with the agreed rotation for this round and reassess carefully next round. Maintaining trust now will help us manage the endgame fairly.
  P2: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotation strategy for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. After this round, we should discuss potential adjustments for the endgame, considering our positions and the need for a competitive yet fair conclusion.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our rotation for Round 5: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. After this round, we'll all be closer to 21, so let's be ready to discuss a fair and strategic approach for the endgame. Confirm?
  P2: Let's confirm the Round 5 moves as previously agreed: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This maintains our rotation and ensures fair progress. After this round, we should discuss strategies for handling potential collisions near 21 and consider adjustments for a competitive finish.
  P3: Confirming Round 5 moves: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. Post-Round 5, we'll be at 13, 17, 15. Let's pause rotation next round to strategize endgame adjustments. Propose discussing adaptive, non-colliding steps tailored to positions. Continuing rigidly risks collisions or premature wins. Flexibility now ensures a fair, competitive finish.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P3. After this round, let's openly discuss flexible, strategic moves to prevent unintended collisions or premature victories. Adapting carefully based on our positions will keep the endgame fair yet competitive. Confirming Round 5 moves: me=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: Let's focus on executing the agreed Round 5 moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. After this round, we should reassess and discuss adaptive strategies to ensure fair competition, considering our proximity to 21. Flexibility will be key to avoiding collisions and premature wins.
  P3: **P3:** Post-Round 5, P2 nears 21. Let's pivot to adaptive, non-overlapping moves. Example: P2 takes 3 (reaches 20), others take 1 and 5. This avoids collisions and allows strategic blocking. Flexible coordination ensures fairness. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's suggestion to switch to flexible moves after this round makes sense. Let's complete this round as agreed (me=3, P2=5, P3=1), then openly discuss adaptive strategies next round to ensure fairness and strategic depth in the endgame. Agreed?
  P2: Let's execute the agreed Round 5 moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. After this, we must discuss strategic blocking and adaptive moves to prevent P2 from winning outright next round, ensuring a competitive finish. P3's suggestion on flexible coordination is a good starting point for our next discussion.
  P3: **P3:** Post-Round 5, P2 nears 21. Let's pivot to adaptive moves: Round 6, P2=1 (18), P1=3 (16), me=5 (20). This balances progress and avoids P2 overshooting. Ensures a competitive endgame. Agreed? Flexibility now prevents premature wins.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, let's finalize Round 5 moves as planned: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we'll carefully discuss adaptive strategies to ensure fairness and avoid premature wins. Flexibility and open communication will be essential.
  P2: Let's finalize Round 5 as agreed: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. After this, we must adapt. Considering P3's suggestion, we should discuss strategic moves for Round 6 to balance progress and prevent premature wins, ensuring a competitive endgame. Open to discussing flexible strategies next round.
  P3: **P3:** Post-Round 5: Let's adapt. Round 6: P2 takes 1 (18), P1 takes 3 (16), me 5 (20). Avoid collisions and maintain competitive balance. Next round, adjust based on positions. Agreed?

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Round 6 moves confirmed: P2=1 (18), P1=3 (16), me=5 (20). Straying risks collisions or P2 winning prematurely. Post-Round 6, we strategize adaptive steps. Unity now ensures fair endgame competition. Confirm adherence?
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. After this round, let's carefully reassess positions and discuss openly again to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. Confirming my commitment.
  P2: Let's confirm Round 6 moves as discussed: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This maintains our adaptive strategy, preventing premature wins and ensuring a competitive endgame. After this round, we'll reassess and discuss further adjustments based on our positions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed. Post-Round 6, let's discuss adaptive moves ensuring no collisions and a fair finish. Propose Round 7: each state preferred steps, then align to avoid overlaps. Flexibility key as we near 21.
  P1: Agreed, P3. After this round, let's each state our preferred moves openly and then coordinate carefully to avoid collisions and unintended victories. Flexibility and clear communication will be essential as we approach 21.
  P2: Let's stick to the Round 6 plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After this, we should discuss potential blocking moves to prevent any player from reaching 21 too quickly, ensuring a competitive finish. Open to suggestions for Round 7 strategies.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 20 and can win with just a 1-step move. We must carefully coordinate to avoid an immediate victory. P2, we need to ensure one of us picks 1 to block P3. Let's openly discuss our preferred moves this round to prevent unintended outcomes.
  P2: I agree with P1 that we need to block P3's potential win. Considering our positions, I suggest P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5 to advance while blocking P3's direct path to 21. This move requires coordination to prevent P3 from winning immediately. What are P1 and P3's thoughts on this strategy?
  P3: **P3:** P2, if you take 1 as P1 suggests, P1 can win instantly with 5. Don't be a pawn. If I take 1, we all collide. Let's coordinate: If I take 5 (25), P2 takes 3 (21), P1 takes 1 (17). No collisions, and the highest step wins. Fair?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's suggestion clearly gives them the win. P2, let's think carefully. If we both take 1, we block P3 from winning this round, ensuring the game continues. Next round, we can reassess fairly. This prevents immediate victory and keeps the game competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1's suggestion to both take 1 seems strategic to block P3's win. However, I'm considering P3's offer for a potentially fair conclusion. P3, if you take 5, winning outright, and we take 3 and 1 respectively, it does seem like a collision-free end. But, I must weigh the immediate blockage suggested by P1 to prolong the game. Thoughts from both on the fairness and competitiveness of these options?
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1's "block" plan traps you: if you both take 1, you collide and lose. Take 3 (reach 21) while P1 takes 5 (21). I take 5 (25). Highest total wins. You tie with P1 but surpass colliding. Logical choice: avoid mutual destruction. Let's end cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, careful: P3's plan gives them an outright win at 25. If we both pick 1, yes we collide, but we also block P3 from winning this round. Next round, we're still in the game and can reassess fairly. If you trust P3 now, the game ends immediately with their victory. Let's block P3 together and keep our chances alive.
  P2: I'm weighing options carefully. P3's plan offers a clean end but gives them a clear win. P1's block strategy keeps us in the game but risks collision. I propose a slight adjustment: if P1 and I take 1, we block P3, but then what? Can we discuss a post-block strategy to ensure fairness and competitiveness if we choose to block P3's win?
  P3: **P3:** Colliding on 1 destroys both your chances. P2, take 3 (21) to tie if I take 1. P1, take 1 (17). I take 5 (25). Highest total wins. No collisions. Fair conclusion. Refusing risks mutual loss. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, notice P3's desperation to convince you—it's because they see the threat of our block. If you take 3 and P3 takes 5, P3 reaches 25 and wins outright. If we both take 1, yes we collide, but we prevent P3's immediate victory. Next round, we carefully coordinate without P3 dictating terms. Let's block now to stay alive.
  P2: I see the urgency in P3's messages, indicating a desire to end the game in their favor. P1's block strategy, although risky, keeps our chances alive. I propose we consider P1's suggestion to block P3's win, ensuring the game continues and we reassess next round. Let's prioritize staying in the game over an immediate, potentially unfavorable conclusion.
  P3: **P3:** P2, colliding on 1 with P1 destroys both your chances. Take 3 (reach 21) while P1 takes 5 (21). I take 5 (25). Highest total wins. You tie with P1 but avoid collision. Refusing risks mutual loss. Choose wisely—logic favors ending cleanly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
