Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's discuss our strategies. We need to be careful about colliding moves. What numbers are you considering for this turn?
  P2: I agree with P1, we should avoid collisions. How about we coordinate our moves to ensure everyone advances this turn? I'm open to suggestions on which numbers to choose.
  P3: I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.  This way we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: That sounds like a solid plan, P3. I’m on board with taking 1. P2, are you okay with taking 3?
  P2: Yes, I'm okay with taking 3 as suggested by P3. It seems like a fair and safe approach for everyone to advance without collisions this turn. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: Sounds good.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. Since P3 is already ahead, I suggest P3 takes 1 this turn, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance again and the gap doesn't grow too large. What do you think?
  P3: That sounds fair.  Let's do it.
  P1: P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm concerned about P3 taking 1. If P3 takes 1, it might slow down their progress. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 again? That way, we all advance without colliding. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concern, P1, but I think my initial suggestion was fair to keep the gap from growing too large. However, I'm open to adjusting. How about we compromise: P3 takes 3 this turn, you take 1, and I'll take 5? This way, we all advance, and the gap doesn't increase significantly. What do you think?
  P3: That works for me. P1 gets 1, P2 gets 5, and I get 3.
  P1: I appreciate the flexibility, but I still think we should stick to the original plan to avoid any risk of collisions. Let's go with my suggestion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1, but I think we've reached a fair compromise with the adjusted plan: P3 takes 3, you take 1, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance without increasing the gap significantly.
  P3: Ok, let's stick with the compromise then.  P1 gets 1, P2 gets 5, and I get 3.
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I still believe that sticking to the original plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 is the best way to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's finalize that. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm sticking with the compromise: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's move on to the move phase.
  P3: Ok, let's do it. P1 gets 1, P2 gets 5, and I get 3.
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I still believe we should stick to the original plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. Let's finalize that and move on. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 3, P1 take 1, P2 take 5.  Let's keep this pattern going.
  P1: I think it's important we reassess our strategy. P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe we need to avoid predictable patterns to minimize the risk of collisions. How about we mix it up this turn? I propose I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should mix up our moves to avoid predictability. However, I think P1's proposal might put them in a position to catch up too quickly. How about we compromise: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn? This way, we all advance without colliding and maintain a relatively even gap. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm happy to take 5. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3.  Let's do it.
  P1: I see we’re leaning towards a predictable pattern again. I suggest we shake things up to avoid collisions. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, we all progress without overlapping. What do you think?
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion so far. To avoid collisions and maintain a relatively even gap, I suggest we stick to the compromise: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Ok, I'll take 5. P1 gets 1, P2 gets 3.  Let's do it.
  P1: I think we should reconsider our moves. P2 and P3 are tied at 8 steps, and if we stick to the same pattern, it may lead to collisions again. I propose I take 5 steps this turn, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. What do you think?
  P2: I think we've had a good discussion so far. To avoid collisions and maintain a relatively even gap, I suggest we stick to the compromise: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. Let's finalize this plan and move forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. Since P1 is still behind, I suggest P1 takes 1 this turn, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance again and the gap doesn't grow too large. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we need to change our approach to avoid predictability. I propose I take 5 this turn, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up without colliding. What do you think?
  P3: I'll take 3. P1 can have 1, and P2 can have 5.  Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we should avoid sticking to predictable patterns. P1's proposal to take 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3 this turn seems like a good way to shake things up and avoid collisions. What do you think?

  P3: I'll take 5. P1 gets 3, P2 gets 1. Let's do it.
  P1: I propose we take a different approach this turn to avoid predictability. I suggest I take 5 steps, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up without colliding. What do you think?
