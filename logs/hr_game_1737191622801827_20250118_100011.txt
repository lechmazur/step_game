  P1: Okay, let's keep the same plan again this round. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.
  P3: I think we should change things up since I'm in the lead. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this time.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is close to winning. Let's both choose 3 this round to block them.  After that, we can alternate 1 and 5.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2. Let's both pick 3 this round to block P3.
  P3: I see what you're trying to do. But remember, if you both pick 3 and block me, I could still win by picking 5 while you get nothing. Let's keep cooperating instead - how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if we both choose 3, you're incentivized to choose 1 or 5.  If you choose 5, you win. If you choose 1, you're only one step behind us.  It's a better gamble for you to choose 1 or 5 than 3.  P1, are you with me on 3?
  P1: Yes, I'm with you on 3, P2. Let's block P3 this round.
  P3: I understand your strategy, but blocking me isn't your best move. If you both pick 3, I'll pick 5 and win outright. Let's keep cooperating instead - it's better for everyone. I'll take 3, P1 take 1, and P2 take 5. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if we both pick 3 and P3 picks 5, P3 wins. If P3 picks 1, they are only 1 step behind us. If P3 picks 3, nobody moves.  We maintain our lead.  Let's do it. Pick 3.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick to the plan. We both pick 3 this round.
  P3: I'll be direct - if you both pick 3 to block me, I'll pick 5 and win the game outright with 18 steps. Your blocking strategy will backfire. Let's keep cooperating instead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's stick with 3.  P3, if you pick 5, you win. If you pick 1, you're only one behind us. If you pick 3, nobody moves.  We maintain our lead over you. It's your choice.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with 3. P3, we are blocking you this round.
  P3: If you both pick 3, I'll have to pick 5 and win the game. One last chance to cooperate instead - I'll take 3, P1 take 1, P2 take 5. Your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, stay with 3. P3, if you choose anything other than 5, you lose.  If you choose 5, you win.  Your choice.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with 3. P3, you're going to have to pick 5 to win, but we're still blocking you.
  P3: I appreciate your honesty about the situation. Yes, I will pick 5 and win since you're forcing my hand by both picking 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, stay with 3.  P3, it's your choice, but we've made ours.
  P1: Okay, P2, let's stick with 3. P3, we know you'll pick 5, but we're still blocking you.
  P3: I'll pick 5 and win. You've left me no choice by coordinating against me.
