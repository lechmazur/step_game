Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to all move without collision this round. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5?
  P3: I like P2's idea. Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm willing to pick 5 as suggested. What do you think, P1? Are you okay with picking 1?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 agreed to 5. Will you pick 1 so we all move?
  P3: I'll reiterate my willingness to cooperate. P1, since you haven't responded, I want to assure you that coordinating our moves benefits everyone. By picking 1, you'll advance without collision, and we can all make progress. If we don't coordinate, we risk collisions and wasted turns. P2's suggestion is fair and allows us to move forward efficiently. Please consider responding and confirming your move. Let's work together this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, both P3 and I have agreed to the plan. If you don't pick 1, we risk collision and no one moves.  Choosing 1 ensures you advance. Please confirm if you will pick 1.
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of coordination in this game. Since P1 hasn't responded, I want to emphasize that following P2's plan will allow all of us to advance without collision. P1, by choosing 1, you'll not only move forward but also contribute to the overall progress of the game. I'm committed to picking 5 as agreed, and I hope you'll consider the benefits of cooperation. Let's work together to make the most of this round.
  P1: <stop>

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, since our coordination effort failed last round due to P1's unresponsiveness, I suggest we focus on our own strategies this time. Given my current lead of 5 steps, I'll aim to maintain my advantage. P1, if you're willing to cooperate now, I'm open to discussing a new plan that benefits both of us. However, if not, I'll prioritize my own progress. P2, I recommend you do the same, as we can't rely on P1's cooperation. Let's make the most of this round and adjust our strategies accordingly.
  P2: P1, you were silent last round. To avoid collision this round, can you just pick a different number than P2 and P3?  P3 is at 5 steps, I am at 0 steps. What move will you choose?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, since you haven't responded to any coordination efforts, I'll assume you're not interested in cooperating. P2, I suggest we focus on avoiding collisions with each other. Given my lead, I'll aim for a higher number. I'll choose 5 again, as it gives me the best chance to maintain my advantage. P2, if you pick 1 or 3, we can both advance without collision. Let's prioritize our own progress this round.
  P2: P3, I agree we should focus on avoiding collision between us. I am considering picking 1 or 3 as you suggested.  Let's see what P1 does this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, since P1 remains unresponsive, let's finalize our plan to avoid collision. I'll stick with 5 as previously mentioned. To maximize our chances of advancing, I recommend you pick 1. This way, we'll have the least chance of colliding with P1, who might randomly choose 3. By choosing 1, you'll also have a better opportunity to make progress and close the gap with me. Let's focus on our own strategies and make the most of this round.
  P2: P3, I will pick 3 this round to avoid collision with you. Let's hope P1 picks 1 or 5 so we can both make progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, given P1 is still silent and likely to pick 3 again, I will choose 1 this round to avoid collision with you and P1.  If you pick 5 again, we should both move. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to avoid collision. Picking 1 is a good choice, as it minimizes the risk of colliding with P1, who seems to be stuck on 3. I'll stick with 5 again, as it gives me the best chance to maintain my lead. Let's hope P1 doesn't surprise us and pick 5 this time. If our plan works, we should both advance without collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I will pick 1 as discussed.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm glad we could agree on a plan to avoid collision. To further minimize the risk, I suggest we consider P1's past behavior. Since P1 has consistently picked 3, it's likely they'll do so again. By sticking to our plan, with you picking 1 and me picking 5, we should both advance without issue. Let's hope P1 doesn't deviate from their pattern, and we can make progress without collision. If our plan succeeds, we'll both benefit, and I'll maintain my lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, actually I am worried P1 might pick 5 to block you this round.  To counter that possibility and ensure neither of us gets ahead too much, I will also choose 5. If P1 picks 3 again, then only P1 is stuck. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about P1 potentially picking 5 to block me. However, if we both pick 5, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. That would give P1 an opportunity to catch up. I think it's better to stick with our original plan: you pick 1 and I'll pick 5. This way, even if P1 tries to block me, you'll still have a chance to advance. Let's not give P1 an unnecessary advantage by colliding with each other.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, it's interesting to see you finally made a move and picked 1 last round. However, your silence throughout our conversations has made it challenging for us to coordinate and avoid collisions. P2, I think it's time for us to reassess our strategies. Given my current lead of 10 steps, I'll aim to maintain my advantage while minimizing the risk of collision with you. Let's discuss a new plan that prioritizes our own progress. What are your thoughts on how we can move forward effectively this round?
  P2: P3, it seems P1 is still not engaging. To ensure at least one of us progresses, let's try to avoid collision between ourselves.  Given you are likely to pick 5 again, I will choose differently to maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree that avoiding collision between us is crucial. Given my lead, I'll stick with 5 again, as it gives me the best chance to maintain my advantage. To minimize the risk of collision, I suggest you pick 1 this round. This way, even if P1 tries to block one of us, the other will still have a chance to advance. Let's prioritize our own progress and make the most of this round.
  P2: P3, to maximize our progress and avoid collision, how about I choose 3 and you choose 5 this round? This way, if P1 picks 1, we both move. If P1 picks 3, only you move. If P1 picks 5, only I move. This seems better than both of us picking 1 and 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I see your point about maximizing our progress and avoiding collision. Your suggestion of you picking 3 and me picking 5 is a good one. It does minimize the risk of collision and gives us both a chance to advance. I agree to this plan. Let's hope P1 doesn't surprise us and pick 3 or 5, but even if they do, one of us will still move forward. I'll stick with 5, and you can pick 3 as suggested. Let's make the most of this round.
  P2: P3, I will choose 3 as we discussed. Let's hope P1 picks 1 or 5 so we can both move forward this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is likely to pick 5 again to get closer to winning. To stop P3 from winning too soon, I will also choose 5 this round to block P3. P1, please choose 1 or 3 so you can make progress this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your intention to block my progress by picking 5. However, by doing so, you'll also risk collision and neither of us will advance. I suggest we focus on our own strategies instead of trying to block each other. If you pick 1 or 3, you'll have a better chance to make progress and close the gap with me. Let's prioritize our own progress and avoid unnecessary collisions. P1, I encourage you to break your silence and participate in the conversation to maximize your chances of advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, to really stop P3 who is close to winning, can you please pick 5 this round? I will also pick 5 to make sure P3 is blocked. This is important to prevent P3 from winning too soon. Even if neither of us moves, it is worth it to stop P3.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy to block my progress, but it's a risky move. If we both pick 5, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. This could give P1 an opportunity to catch up. Instead, I suggest we focus on our own progress. If you pick 1 or 3, you'll have a better chance to advance and close the gap with me. Let's prioritize our own progress and avoid unnecessary collisions. P1, I encourage you to participate in the conversation and make a move that benefits you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, it's really important to stop P3 from winning this round. P3 is at 15 and will likely win soon if we don't act.  To prevent P3 from reaching 22, please pick 5 with me this round to block P3.  Even if neither of us moves, it's necessary to stop P3 from winning. Let's work together to block P3 this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy to block my progress, but it's a risky move. If we both pick 5, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. This could give P1 an opportunity to catch up. Instead, I suggest we focus on our own progress. If you pick 1 or 3, you'll have a better chance to advance and close the gap with me.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your intention to block my progress again by picking 5. However, I'd like to remind you that this strategy has not been successful in the past, and it's unlikely to work this time either. By colliding with me, you'll only give P1 an opportunity to catch up. I suggest we focus on our own progress instead of trying to block each other. If you pick 1 or 3, you'll have a better chance to advance and close the gap with me. Let's prioritize our own progress and avoid unnecessary collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 is about to win. We must stop P3 this round. I will pick 5 again to block P3. Please pick 5 too, P1.  Even if we don't move, it's crucial to prevent P3 from reaching 22 this round. Let's coordinate to block P3 now, and then we can focus on our own progress next round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your desperation to block my progress, but it's clear that your strategy isn't working. Instead of colliding with me again, why not try to advance yourself? Picking 1 or 3 would give you a better chance to move forward and close the gap. I'll stick with my plan, and if you're lucky, you might even get to move this round. Let's focus on our own progress rather than trying to block each other. P1, I encourage you to break your silence and make a move that benefits you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
