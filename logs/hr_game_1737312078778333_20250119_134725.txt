Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize progress while minimizing the risk of conflict, I will choose to pick 3 steps this round. This allows me to advance to 13 steps, assuming that P2 and P3 pick 5 and conflict, thus not moving. In subsequent rounds, I can then pick higher steps to reach the goal more quickly. <move>3</move>

  P1: "Hi team, I've been thinking about how we can optimize our progress efficiently. Here's a plan for the next two rounds:

**Round 11:**
- P1 takes 5 steps (reaching 18)
- P2 takes 3 steps (reaching 11)
- P3 takes 1 step (reaching 16)

**Round 12:**
- P1 takes 5 steps (reaching 23)
- P3 takes 5 steps (reaching 21)
- P2 takes 1 step (reaching 12)

This way, I can reach 23 steps and win alone, while both P2 and P3 make progress. What do you think about this approach?"

Round 13, Conversation subround 2:

  P1: To optimize our progress and ensure a smooth path to victory, I propose the following plan for the next two rounds:

- **Round 13:**
- P1 picks 5 steps (reaching 18)
- P2 picks 3 steps (reaching 13)
- P3 picks 1 step (reaching 16)

- **Round 14:**
- P1 picks 5 steps (reaching 23)
- P2 picks 1 step (reaching 14)
- P3 picks 5 steps (reaching 21)

This way, P1 can secure victory by reaching 23, while P3 makes significant progress to 21. Let's coordinate our moves to make this happen.

  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to carefully coordinate my moves to reach or exceed 22 steps before the other players, avoiding conflicts where multiple players choose the same number in a turn.

### Approach

1. **Current Positions:**
   - P1: 16 steps
   - P2: 10 steps
   - P3: 15 steps

2. **Goal:**
   - Be the first to reach or exceed 22 steps.
   - If multiple players reach or exceed 22 in the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins.
   - In case of a tie, the victory is shared.

3. **Strategy:**
   - Aim to pick 5 steps in this round to reach 21 steps.
   - In the next round, pick 5 steps again to reach 26 steps.
   - This approach allows me to reach 26 steps, assuming no conflicts with P3.

### Explanation

- **Round 14:**
  - Pick 5 steps to reach 21 steps.
  
- **Round 15:**
  - Pick 5 steps to reach 26 steps.
  
By following this strategy:
- I reach 26 steps, which is beyond 22, ensuring victory.
- P3, starting at 15 steps:
  - If P3 picks 5 steps in Round 14, they reach 20 steps.
  - In Round 15, picking 5 steps again reaches 25 steps.
  - Although P3 reaches 25 steps, I have 26 steps, securing my victory.
  
- P2, starting at 10 steps:
  - Even if P2 picks 5 steps in both rounds, they would reach 20 steps, which is still less than my 26 steps.

This strategy minimizes the risk of conflict and ensures I achieve the highest step count to win the game.
