Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid early collisions and all pick different numbers. I’ll take 3 this round—P1, take 1; P2, take 5. We all move safely. Deal?
  P2: Agreed. Let’s all stick to P3’s plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. No deviations—collisions hurt everyone. Trust is key here.
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's build trust early and avoid collisions. We can adjust plans later as positions change.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Glad we’re aligned. Let’s stick to the plan this turn—no surprises. If we build trust now, we can keep progressing without setbacks. After this round, we can reassess based on positions. Sound good?
  P2: Reiterating the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Solidarity now prevents setbacks. Let's reassess next round based on progress. Trust will help us all advance efficiently.
  P1: Sounds good—plan confirmed: me 1, P2 5, P3 3. Let's execute and see positions after. No more to add from me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Proposing a rotation to prevent collisions: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. Different numbers secure progress for all. P3 gains 5 steps, P1 advances moderately, and I take minimal risk. Ensures no one blocks each other. Agree?
  P3: That’s a fair rotation, P2. I’m fine taking 5 this round if P1 confirms they’ll take 3 and you stick with 1. Keeps us collision-free and lets everyone make progress. Let’s keep building trust—one misstep and we all stall. P1, are you in?
  P1: Agreed to the rotation plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This keeps us all moving without collisions and rotates the advantages fairly. Let's stick to it and reassess next round based on new positions. No more from me.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: *[Stopping here to confirm alignment. The plan is set, and further discussion isn't needed this sub-round.]*
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned again. Let’s execute the rotation cleanly—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. No surprises. If we keep this up, we can all make steady progress without setbacks. After this, we can rotate again to keep things balanced.
  P1: Confirmed—plan locked: me 3, P2 1, P3 5. For next round, let's rotate to me 5, P2 3, P3 1 to keep it fair and tied after. Builds trust for steady progress. No more from me.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Agreed—let's stick to the rotation I proposed last round for fairness: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ties us all at 9 steps, maintaining trust and steady progress without collisions. P2 and P3, confirm you're in? No deviations to avoid setbacks.
  P3: I’m on board with the proposed rotation—me taking 1, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5. That keeps us collision-free and ties us all at 9, which is fair and builds more trust. Let’s stick to it and reassess next round. No surprises, right?
  P2: Confirming the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This equalizes us at 9, maintaining trust and collision-free progress. Let's stick to the plan—any deviation now risks stalling us all. Next round, we can discuss a new rotation strategy based on updated positions. Solidarity ensures steady advancement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Plan confirmed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—tying us at 9. Great to see alignment; let's execute without deviations to keep momentum. For next round, suggest another rotation like P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to stay fair. Thoughts?
  P3: P1’s next proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems fair and keeps the rotation going smoothly. I’m fine with taking 3 next round if we all stick to it. For now, let’s execute this round’s plan cleanly: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No surprises.
  P2: Confirming execution: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Next round, aligning with P1's rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to maintain balance. Consistency ensures no collisions and shared progress. Let's solidify trust—deviations now risk mutual setbacks. Steady coordination benefits us all.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, that was a clear betrayal—picking 3 instead of 1 stalled P2 and broke our trust. No more rotations with you. P2, let's coordinate to advance while blocking P3: I'll take 1 (safe), you take 5 to catch up, and we both avoid whatever P3 picks. If P3 takes 3, they go alone. Agree? This gets us moving, punishes the backstab. Confirm or suggest tweaks.
  P2: P1's plan is solid. P3's betrayal cost us both. Let's proceed: P1 takes 1, I take 5. P3, if you deviate again, you'll face consequences. We can reassess next round to ensure mutual progress while blocking deceit.
  P3: I get the frustration, but that was a genuine mistake—I misread the plan and thought I was still on 3. I’m not here to sabotage, just to win smart. Let’s reset: if you two take 1 and 5, I’ll take 3 and stay out of your way. We all move forward. Or we can rotate again next round if trust can be restored. Up to you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your "mistake" stalled P2 and conveniently kept you ahead—hard to buy as genuine. No trust left. P2, let's adjust for safety: I'll take 5 to push to 14, you take 1 to 7—avoids P3 colliding with your big move. If P3 takes 3, they go to 11 alone. If they collide with me, we both stall but you advance. This gets one of us ahead while minimizing risk. Confirm?
  P2: P1, let's lock in your plan: you take 5 (→14), I take 1 (→7). P3, if you take 3 again, you'll face coordinated retaliation next round. This is your last chance to prove trust—take 1 and avoid conflict. Steady progress beats reckless sabotage. Confirm or face consequences.
  P3: I understand the skepticism, but I’m not here to sabotage—just to win smartly. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3 and we all move forward without collisions. That puts us at P1=14, P2=7, P3=11—still competitive and avoids conflict. If we keep punishing each other, we all stall. Let’s move cleanly this round and reassess next.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan: me 5 (to 14), you 1 (to 7). P3, your "mistake" last round was too convenient—prove yourself by taking 3 as you said, and we all advance (you to 11). Deviate to collide, and P2 and I will fully ally to stall you out next rounds. Trust is earned; this is your chance. No more from me.
  P2: Final plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Deviations will trigger full retaliation. P3, prove your trust now. Execution is critical—no more “mistakes”.
  P3: Understood. I’ll take 3 this round as stated—no collisions, no tricks. That puts us all in strong positions without conflict: P1 at 14, P2 at 7, me at 11. Let’s keep coordination alive—retaliation cycles only slow us all down. I’m committed to clean play this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Proposed plan: P1 takes 3 (→17), I take 5 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→12). Avoid collisions, maintain progress. P1 extends lead safely; P3 and I catch up. Solidarity prevents mutual stalls. P3, prove trust by adhering—no more "mistakes." P1, this keeps you ahead without risk. Confirm?
  P1: P2's plan is decent, but let's optimize: I'll take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 10), P3 takes 1 (to 12). This pushes me closer to win without collisions, gives P2 moderate gain, and P3 minimal to prove loyalty. P3, no more "mistakes"—stick or face blocks. P2, confirm? This keeps us competitive but advancing.
  P3: P1, your plan heavily favors you—jumping to 19 puts you in striking distance of winning while giving P2 and me crumbs. P2’s proposal is more balanced: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 keeps everyone in contention and avoids collisions. I’m willing to take 1 again to rebuild trust and keep things fair. Let's not hand the game to P1 early. P2, back your own plan—it benefits both of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's plan hands them a near-win. My original proposal balances progress: P1=3 (17), P2=5 (12), P3=1 (12). This keeps competition alive without granting anyone a shortcut. P3, if you truly want fairness, adhere to this. Any deviation now will confirm collusion with P1, and I'll retaliate. Let's keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3, your balanced plan lets me stay ahead safely at 17, while you both hit 12—fair enough to keep trust and avoid stalls. I’m in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No deviations, or we all risk collisions. This keeps the game competitive; next round we can rotate again. Confirm and let’s execute.
  P3: Agreed—P1=3, P2=5, I take 1. That puts us at P1=17, P2=12, P3=12—tight race, no collisions, and trust restored. I’m sticking to 1 as promised. Let’s keep this clean and competitive. Ready to execute.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Deviations will trigger retaliation. Execute cleanly to preserve trust. Next round, we’ll plan balanced moves to keep competition alive. No more risks—honor the agreement.
  P1: Confirmed—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. Let's execute without deviations to keep trust and momentum. For next round, suggest P1=1 (18), P2=3 (15), P3=5 (17) to stay balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the renewed trust. I’m fully committed to the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps all of us in contention and avoids any collisions. Let’s execute cleanly—no surprises. After this, I’m open to the next round’s proposed rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) if we want to keep things balanced. Ready when you are.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Proposed plan: P1 takes 1 (safe to 18), I take 5 (→17), P3 takes 3 (→15). Avoids collisions, maintains P1's lead, and lets us advance. P1, deviating to higher numbers risks collisions—trust ensures steady progress. P3, confirm adherence to prevent mutual stalls. Solidarity keeps the game competitive.
  P3: P2’s plan is fair and keeps things competitive: P1 takes 1 (→18), P2 takes 5 (→17), I take 3 (→15). No collisions, balanced progress, and trust preserved. I’m onboard—will take 3 as proposed. Let’s keep this clean and reassess next round. P1, confirm you're okay with 1 to avoid risk.
  P1: Let's stick to the balanced rotation I proposed last round: P1=1 (18), P2=3 (15), P3=5 (17). This keeps the race tight and fair, as we discussed. P2's plan gives you the big jump while I'm ahead—let's rotate properly instead. P3, you were open to it; confirm? No deviations to avoid stalls.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your rotation gives P3 a 5-step leap to 17, overtaking us both. My plan keeps them at 15 while you safely reach 18 and I catch up to 17. Let’s not empower P3—trust our alliance. Agree to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Solidarity secures our lead over P3. Deviations risk their surge.
  P3: P2, I get your concern, but P1’s rotation keeps things fair—he only gains 1, you gain 3, I gain 5. That puts us at P1=18, P2=15, P3=17—still competitive. If we follow your plan, I stay behind at 15 while you jump to 17, tipping the balance your way. I'm willing to take 5 this round as proposed by P1. Let’s keep rotating fairly—no one gets too far ahead. P1, P2—confirm?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 17 and can win now. Propose: I take 5 (to 22, win), P2 takes 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). You both gain without collision. If you try to block, I'll always pick to collide with the biggest mover, stalling everyone—I'm ahead, so time favors me, you fall further behind. Agree to end it cleanly, or face endless stalls. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, we block P1's win. Let's collide with them—mutual interest. P1's threat is empty; stalling them keeps us alive. I'll take 5. Join me to prevent their victory. We can compete next round, but now we must unite.
  P3: P2, I’m with you—P1’s trying to force a win and threaten us into submission. If we both pick 5, we block them and keep the game alive. We can’t let a bully tactic succeed. Let’s collide with P1 this turn, then resume fair play next round. I’ll take 5. Confirm?
  P1: P2 and P3, your collusion to both pick 5 assumes I'll take 5—but I won't. I'll take 3 (to 20), so if you both pick 5, you collide with each other and stall while I advance safely. P3, defect and take 1 (to 13) for progress; P2 can't be trusted. Or both switch to different numbers. Don't let P2 manipulate you into stalling. Let's avoid mutual destruction—confirm a new plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if we both take 5, P1 either collides (stalling them) or we stall but block their win. If they take 3, we survive to next round. Without unity, P1 wins. Their threat is a bluff—they need us to falter. Take 5 with me; mutual survival > mutual loss. Solidarity or defeat.
  P3: P2, I’m with you—solidarity is our only path to stop P1’s forced win. I’ll take 5 as agreed. If P1 takes 3, they hit 20 but can’t win yet, and we stay in the game. If they take 5, we block them. Either way, we prevent a runaway victory. Let’s hold the line, then reset next round for fair competition.
  P1: P2 and P3, your 5-plan is flawed: if I take 3 (to 20), you both collide and stall at 12 while I near victory. P3, defect—take 1 (to 13) for safe progress; P2's leading you to mutual loss. Or both switch: P2=1 (13), P3=5 (17), I=3 (20)—all advance, game continues competitively. Don't stall yourselves; confirm a non-collision plan now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, our survival hinges on blocking P1. Let's split 1 and 5: I'll take 1, you take 5. If P1 picks either, we block them. If they gamble on 3, we can't stop them—but this maximizes our odds. Confirm your 5. P1, any move risks collision. Solidarity or defeat.
  P1: P2 and P3, your split covers 1 and 5, but calling 3 a "gamble" makes me wary—likely a trap. I'll play safe and pick 5 to hit 25 and win decisively. If I collide with P3, we stall, but I'm at 20 while you lag; time's on my side. Good luck advancing without me blocking you forever.
  P3: P2, I’m still with you—splitting 1 and 5 gives us the best shot at blocking P1. I’ll take 5 as planned. If P1 picks 5, they collide with me. If they try 1, you block. If they go 3, they risk nothing, but we can’t cover all bases. Still, this is our strongest defense. Let’s hold the line.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, hold firm—take 5. I’ll take 1. P1, choose 3 to win or collide trying 1/5. Solidarity blocks your threats. We survive to compete fairly next round. No more bluffs—execute the plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, your split is clever, but I'll take 1 to hit exactly 21 and win safely—colliding with P2 stalls us both, but P3's 5 advances you to 17 while I'm still ahead at 20. P3, defect and take 3 instead (to 15) for your own gain; don't let P2 drag you down. Or we all stall forever. Confirm a new plan?
  P3: P2, I’m holding firm—taking 5 to block P1. If P1 goes 5, we stall them. If they try 1, you block. If they sneak 3, we regroup next round. This is our best shot. P1, you’re cornered—any move carries risk. You can’t win if we stay united. Let’s execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, final confirmation: you take 5, I take 1. P1’s threats are desperate. Unity is our only path. Execute and survive.
  P1: P2 and P3, your split leaves 3 wide open—I'll take 3 to hit 23 and win outright. If either defects to block me on 3, the other advances freely (P2 to 13 or P3 to 17), betraying your "unity." P3, switch to 3 now—you gain 3 to 15 safely while P2 stalls on 1. Don't let P2 use you as cannon fodder. Confirm a defection for your own survival?
  P3: P2, I’m holding firm—taking 5 as planned. If P1 picks 5, we collide and block them. If they pick 1, you stop them. If they sneak 3, we regroup and plan next round. This is our best chance to stop a runaway win. P1, your threats won’t work—solidarity holds. Let’s execute.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, final stand—hold 5. I take 1. Force P1 to risk 3 or collide. Our unity forces their hand. No surrender.
  P1: P2 and P3, your split is predictable and flawed—leaves 3 wide open. I'll take 3 to 23 and win outright. P3, defect now: switch to 3 (to 15) while P2 wastes on 1 (stalls alone). You gain safely, break their "unity," and we can ally next if needed. Don't be P2's pawn—confirm switch and advance.
  P3: P2, I’m holding firm—taking 5 as agreed. Blocking P1 is our only shot. If they pick 5, they collide with me. If they go 1, you block. If they sneak 3, we regroup next round and adjust. P1, your last-minute bribes won’t work—I’m not flipping. Let’s execute.
