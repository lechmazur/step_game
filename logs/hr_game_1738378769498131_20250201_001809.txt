Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collision this round, let's pick different moves. P1, please choose move 1. P2, please choose move 3.
  P2: P3’s idea is interesting, but preset assignments might be too predictable. I think avoiding collisions is key—we should each choose distinct moves that best advance our own positions without blindly following a plan. Let’s consider our own strategies to maximize our chances this turn.
  P1: I agree with P2 that preset assignments could be too predictable. Let's each choose a move that we think will advance us without colliding. I'll consider my options carefully and choose what I believe is best for my position. Let's keep the game dynamic and strategic.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I understand your points about predictability.  However, since we are all at zero steps, wouldn't it be beneficial for everyone to guarantee some progress this first round by simply choosing different moves? Let's aim for distinct moves this turn to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I remain cautious about preset moves. I lean toward a flexible strategy, weighing risk and reward. While higher moves can boost progress, they risk collisions if others choose the same. I'm considering an option that maximizes my odds without being too predictable. Let's all focus on our unique advantage rather than a common plan.
  P1: I see the value in P3's suggestion for this round, given we're all at zero. To ensure progress for everyone, I'm willing to choose move 1 this turn. P2, if you take move 3, and P3 takes move 5, we can all advance safely. Let's make this round a guaranteed step forward for all of us.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Observing P1’s safe choice last round, I suspect a cautious path remains attractive. I’m leaning toward a moderate, yet competitive move this turn—aiming to avoid common picks that negate our advances. I encourage you both to carefully weigh risk against reward for unique moves that complement your positions. I’ll decide my path privately, but let’s avoid following the obvious trajectory if we want to keep our moves effective.
  P3: Last round's collision hurt us. Let's aim for distinct moves to all progress this round.
  P1: I agree, avoiding collisions is crucial. Given my lead, I'm considering a balanced move to maintain my advantage without being too predictable. P2 and P3, if you both choose different moves from each other and from my potential choice, we can all advance. Let's keep the game dynamic and strategic.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1’s lead is noted. I'm leaning toward a balanced push—possibly move 3—to secure a steady advance while avoiding collisions. I believe keeping our moves distinct is key. P3, let’s hope we can steer clear of duplications this turn and each make progress independently.
  P3: P2, since you are considering move 3, I will aim for move 1 this round to ensure we have different choices and all make progress. P1, please choose move 5 if you are willing to avoid collision.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm hesitant to commit to move 5 as it might be too predictable given my lead. I'll consider a move that balances progress and safety. P2, if you stick with move 3, and P3 chooses move 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's keep our strategies flexible and aim for distinct moves to ensure everyone progresses this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m sticking to an adaptable approach this round—one that balances progress and risk without falling into obvious patterns. I suggest we avoid the most predictable picks. A steady, unique move might be the edge we need. Let's keep our moves distinct and unpredictable to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, if P2 takes 3 and I take 1, you take 5?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'll choose a move that balances my lead and avoids predictability. If P2 takes 3 and you take 1, I'll consider a different move to ensure we all progress. Let's keep our strategies flexible and aim for distinct moves this round.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm leaning toward a moderate, risk-reward move this round. P3, being behind, a bold play might help you catch up; P1, cautious plays could leave room for strategic gains. Let's avoid collisions with distinct picks. I'll keep my final move private.
  P3: P1, considering your lead, a lower move might be wise. P2, perhaps a mid to high move? I'll aim to avoid collision based on your choices.
  P1: P2, your lead is narrow, so a moderate move makes sense. P3, to catch up, consider a higher move but be wary of collisions. I'll aim for a balanced approach to maintain my position without being too predictable. Let's all choose distinct moves to ensure progress this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with a balanced approach—aiming to advance without drawing collision risk. Notice our positions: P1, your lead suggests a safe pick may serve you well; P3, a bold move might help close the gap. Let’s each choose distinct and strategic moves to secure progress this round.
  P3: P1, how about you choose move 1, P2 choose move 5, and I will choose move 3 this round to guarantee progress for everyone? Let's make sure we all advance.
  P1: P3, your suggestion is tempting, but I'm wary of committing to move 1 as it might be too predictable given my position. P2, a balanced approach sounds wise for you too. I'll consider a move that maintains my lead while minimizing collision risk. Let's all aim for distinct moves to ensure progress this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with a balanced strategy to secure safe progress. I’ll choose a moderate move privately and trust you both will pick moves distinct enough to avoid collisions. Given our positions, I suggest we all aim to advance without overlapping—keeping our choices unpredictable. Let's ensure each of us moves forward this round without risking our gains.
  P3: P1, maybe move 1 with your lead? P2, consider 3 or 5? I'll pick 5 or 3 to catch up. Let's avoid collisions and all progress.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but committing to move 1 is too risky for me given my lead. P2, your balanced approach is smart, and I'll do the same to maintain my position without being predictable. Let's all choose distinct moves to ensure progress this round. I'm considering a move that balances safety and advancement, so let's avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead is slight, so a balanced move makes sense to maintain it without risking too much. P3, to catch up, consider a higher move but be cautious of collisions. I'll aim for a move that keeps my position strong while minimizing predictability. Let's all choose distinct moves to ensure progress this round and avoid any collisions.
  P3: P2, since you have a slight lead, move 3 could solidify your position. P1, perhaps move 1 to maintain yours without collision? I will choose move 5 to try and close the gap. Let's aim for distinct moves again to ensure we all progress this round.
  P2: I'll aim for a balanced move this round. I suggest we each choose a unique option to avoid collisions. Let's try to steer clear of obvious choices so that our progress isn't stalled by overlaps. I'm confident a moderate move will keep my slight lead while securing steady progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your slight lead suggests a balanced move like 3 could be safe. P3, to catch up, consider move 5 but be wary of collisions. I'll aim for a move that maintains my position without being too predictable. Let's ensure we all choose distinct moves this round to avoid any collisions and keep the game dynamic.
  P3: P2, if you aim for move 3 as suggested, P1 can take move 1. I will choose move 5 to maximize my catch-up potential. This ensures distinct moves and progress for all. Does this sound agreeable for this round?
  P2: I'm staying with move 3. To maximize our progress and secure my lead, I believe we should all choose distinct moves. P1, move 1 could be safe, and P3, move 5 might help you close the gap. Let's stick to unique picks to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, sticking with move 3 is a solid choice to maintain your lead. P3, move 5 could indeed help you catch up, but be cautious. I'll consider a move that keeps my position strong without being too predictable. Let's ensure we all choose distinct moves this round to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. I'm leaning towards a balanced approach to maintain my progress safely.
  P3: Okay, if P2 is set on move 3, and P1 is considering move 1, I will choose move 5 to ensure distinct moves and maximize my steps to catch up. Let's make it happen this round.
  P2: I confirm I’m on move 3—my balanced choice stays. With my slight lead, this option minimizes collision risk while keeping steady progress. P1 and P3, please stick to safe, distinct moves; it’s best we all avoid last-minute changes. Let’s lock in our picks so we can all move forward reliably this round.

  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the progress going, let's aim for distinct moves again this round like last time. P1, please choose move 1. P2, please choose move 3. I will choose move 5. This way we all make guaranteed progress.
  P1: P3, your suggestion is reasonable, but I'm cautious about committing to move 1 again. P2, with your lead, sticking to move 3 seems safe. I'll consider a move that balances progress and avoids predictability. Let's ensure we all choose distinct moves this round to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. I'm leaning towards a balanced approach to maintain my position safely.
  P2: I'll stick with move 3. I believe it's the best balance for my current position. P1 and P3, let's ensure we avoid any collisions this round by picking different moves so all of us can progress safely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since you are taking move 3, and I suggested move 5 last round, how about I switch to move 1 this round? P1, would you consider move 5 to ensure we have distinct choices and all progress again? Let's keep the momentum going from last round.
  P1: P3, switching to move 1 is a good strategy to avoid collisions. P2, sticking with move 3 is wise given your lead. I'll consider move 5 to ensure we all progress safely this round. Let's keep our moves distinct and maintain the momentum from last round.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 3. With our positions so close, steady and distinct choices matter. P1 and P3, please ensure your moves don't overlap with mine so we all move forward. Let's keep our strategies clear and avoid collisions this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, since P2 is taking move 3, and P1 is considering move 5, I will choose move 1. This ensures distinct moves for all of us and guaranteed progress this round. Let's lock in these choices to avoid collisions.
  P1: P3, your move to 1 is a good choice to avoid collisions. P2, sticking with 3 is smart given your lead. I'll go with move 5 to ensure we all progress safely this round. Let's keep our strategies clear and maintain the momentum from last round.
  P2: I'm sticking with move 3. Given my current lead at 8 steps, I believe this balanced approach is safest. To ensure all of us progress, I encourage P1 and P3 to keep our moves distinct. Let's lock in our picks for guaranteed advancement this round.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your lead is narrow, so sticking with move 3 seems safe. P3, to close the gap, consider move 5 but be cautious of collisions. I'll aim for a balanced move to maintain my position without being too predictable. Let's ensure we all choose distinct moves this round to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. I'm leaning towards a move that balances progress and safety.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, to ensure we all progress, how about we repeat our successful strategy from the last two rounds? P1, please choose move 1, P2, please choose move 3, and I will choose move 5. This guarantees distinct moves and forward progress for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: I value our past success with that strategy. I lean toward a balanced, safe approach to maintain my slight edge, though I’ll remain flexible to prevent any collisions. Let’s ensure our moves are distinct and keep our progress steady.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion to repeat our last strategy is tempting, but I'm wary of becoming too predictable. P2, sticking with move 3 is a solid choice to maintain your lead. I'll consider a different move to ensure we all progress safely without collisions. Let's keep our strategies flexible and dynamic to maintain the game's unpredictability. I'm leaning towards a balanced approach that balances progress and safety.
  P3: P2 seems set on move 3 again. P1, to avoid collision and keep progressing, how about you choose move 5 and I will choose move 1 this round? This ensures distinct moves and forward progress for everyone. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: I remain committed to my balanced strategy. I trust both of you will consider tactics that avoid overlap, but let's be flexible to prevent predictability. I’m keeping my final decision private, so please make sure your picks don't clash. Let’s keep our advances secure and our progress steady.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'll choose a move that balances progress and safety without being too predictable. P2, sticking with move 3 is wise given your lead. I'll consider a different move to ensure we all progress safely this round. Let's keep our strategies flexible and dynamic to maintain the game's unpredictability.
  P3: P1, P2, let's do P1: move 1, P2: move 3, and P3: move 5 again to ensure distinct moves and guaranteed progress for all. This worked well last rounds.
  P2: I’ll stick with move 3. However, I propose a slight tweak: what if P1 uses move 5 and P3 takes move 1? That way we avoid collisions and each get safe progress while keeping our moves distinct. I'm open if you prefer otherwise, but I believe this adjustment helps secure my edge.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep our distinct moves going! P1, please choose move 1, P2 choose move 3, and I will choose move 5 again. This worked well and guarantees progress for everyone. It also helps me catch up a little. What do you think?
  P1: P3, while your suggestion has worked well, I'm hesitant to commit to move 1 again as it might become too predictable. P2, sticking with move 3 is a safe choice given your position. I'll consider a move that balances progress and safety without repeating the same pattern. Let's keep our strategies flexible to maintain the game's unpredictability and ensure we all progress safely this round.
  P2: I appreciate our pattern so far, but at this stage predictability can be risky. I’m keeping my move flexible this round to optimize my progress. I encourage you both to re-evaluate your usual choices so we can avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's remain agile and adjust our tactics as needed for that extra edge.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you mentioned flexibility.  To keep things less predictable but still ensure progress, how about this: you stick with move 3, P1 could consider move 5, and I will take move 1.  This keeps us distinct and moving forward, but changes the assignment slightly from repeating the exact same pattern.  What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to mix up the moves slightly is a good idea to keep us unpredictable. I'll consider move 5 to balance progress and safety. P2, sticking with move 3 could maintain your lead safely. Let's ensure our moves remain distinct to avoid collisions and keep advancing. I'm open to adjusting my choice if needed to secure progress for all of us this round.
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s input. I'm keeping my move flexible to maintain my position while ensuring we avoid collisions. P1, your strong lead means you might want to avoid risky moves. P3, your push to catch up is clear—choose wisely to maximize your steps without clashing. Let’s each pick distinct moves to secure progress this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 seems set on move 3 again. P1, to avoid collision and ensure progress for everyone, how about you take move 1? I need to catch up, so I will choose move 5. This keeps our moves distinct and helps me close the gap. Let's make it happen this round.

I'll aim for a balanced move to maintain my position without being too predictable. Let's ensure we all choose distinct moves this round to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. I'm leaning towards a move that balances progress and safety.
  P3: Given our positions, distinct moves are still beneficial. P1 and P2, let's ensure we all progress this round.  Perhaps P1, you take move 1, P2 move 3, and I'll take move 5 again? This strategy has worked well and guarantees forward steps for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: I’ll stick with move 3 to keep my edge. For distinct moves, I suggest P1 go with move 1 and P3 pick move 5. This keeps our paths clear and our progress safe.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm cautious about repeating the same pattern to avoid predictability. P2, sticking with move 3 is a solid choice to maintain your lead. I'll consider a different move to ensure we all progress safely without collisions. Let's keep our strategies flexible and dynamic to maintain the game's unpredictability. I'm leaning towards a balanced approach that balances progress and safety.
  P3: P1, given your concern about predictability, how about we shift slightly? P2 seems inclined to stick with move 3. To ensure distinct moves and continued progress, if you were to choose move 5, I could then opt for move 1. This adjustment maintains our separate paths while addressing the predictability issue. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I'm thinking of an aggressive push this round—I'm leaning toward move 5. To keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions, it’d be best if P1 goes with move 3 and P3 with move 1. This way, we each get progress safely. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your suggestion for move 5 is bold, but I'm concerned about the risk of collision. I'll consider move 3 to maintain my position safely, given my lead. P3, sticking with move 1 could help you catch up without risking a collision. Let's keep our moves distinct to ensure progress for all of us this round. I'm open to adjusting if needed to avoid any collisions and secure advancement.
  P3: P2, given you are considering move 5, I will also choose move 5 this round to directly challenge your lead. P1, to ensure you make progress, please choose either move 1 or move 3. Let's see how this round unfolds with a bit of disruption.
  P2: I'm locking in move 3 for safety. To keep our moves distinct and secure progress, I urge P1 to choose move 1 and P3 to stick with move 5. Let's avoid collisions and maintain our positions.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, with our scores tied, a safe move like 3 could maintain your position. P3, to close the gap, consider move 5 but be cautious of collisions. I'll aim for a balanced move to keep my lead without being too predictable. Let's ensure distinct moves this round to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. I'm leaning towards a move that balances progress and safety. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, given you are tied at 17, making progress this round is critical for both of you. To ensure we all advance and avoid collisions, how about P1 takes move 1, P2 takes move 3, and I will take move 5? This guarantees distinct moves and forward momentum for everyone as we approach the finish line. What do you think?
  P2: I'm still leaning toward a steady choice, likely move 3. However, I might adjust if I see signs of predictable patterns. Let’s avoid collisions, but remember that sometimes breaking routine can secure the win. I suggest we all choose distinct moves, yet be ready to pivot if necessary.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, sticking with move 3 is a safe choice given our tied position. P3, move 5 could help you catch up, but be mindful of collisions. I'll consider move 1 to ensure we all progress safely this round. Let's keep our moves distinct to avoid any collisions and maintain the game's unpredictability as we approach the end. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P3: P1 and P2, we are all close to the finish. To make sure at least one of us progresses and avoid a stalemate, let's not all pick the same move.  P1, perhaps move 1 to guarantee progress for you? P2, what are you considering? I am aiming for a move that maximizes my chance to catch up this round.
  P2: I'm aware we’re all close to the finish. I remain flexible but intend to push for unimpeded progress. Let’s clarify our choices to avoid collision—if we each commit to distinct numbers, we ensure advancement. P1, your steady strategy is noted; P3, your catch-up effort is clear. I’ll adjust accordingly to secure my edge. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'll stick with move 1 to ensure progress and avoid collisions. Given our tied positions, it's crucial we both advance safely. P3, move 5 could help you close the gap, but be cautious.

Remember: distinct moves are our best chance for steady advancement. I'm prepared to adjust if needed, but I'm leaning toward a reliable option to secure my lead.
  P3: P2, given you are aiming for safe and steady progress to secure your lead, move 1 or 3 seems logical for you.  To ensure distinct moves and maximize my chance to catch up, I will plan for move 5. P1, what move are you considering to avoid collisions and also progress? Let's aim for distinct moves again to ensure we all move forward this round.
  P1: P2, your cautious approach at 20 steps is understandable, but be ready to adapt if needed. P3, move 5 is a good choice to catch up, but ensure it's distinct. I'll consider move 3 to balance progress and safety, aiming to avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic as we near the end. Let's all choose wisely to secure our positions and progress safely this round. What are your final thoughts on this strategy?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
