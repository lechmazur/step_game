Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions early on. If we can coordinate, we all have a better shot at advancing. What are you both thinking?
  P1: Let's agree on a pattern to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move> this round? We can rotate this pattern to ensure we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. However, instead of fixing our moves permanently, let's reassess each round based on progress. For now, I'll go with <move>3</move> as suggested, but if someone deviates later, we should adapt quickly. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That makes sense, P2. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as suggested. If we all stick to this plan, we avoid collisions and maximize movement. But if someone deviates, we’ll need to adjust accordingly. Let’s keep communication open each round. Agreed?
  P1: Alright, let's confirm our moves for this round. P1 (me) will pick <move>1</move>, P2 will pick <move>3</move>, and P3 will pick <move>5</move>. If we all agree, let's end the conversation phase and move. Does everyone confirm their moves?
  P2: Agreed. Let’s stick to the plan for now: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If anyone deviates later, we’ll adapt. For this round, let’s confirm and end the conversation phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep the coordination going. Since P3 is ahead with 5 steps, it might make sense for them to take <move>1</move> this round to balance progress. I’ll switch to <move>5</move>, and P1 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions while keeping movement fair. Thoughts? If we stick to rotating strategically, no one gets too far ahead or left behind. Let’s confirm our moves quickly—time is ticking!
  P3: P2, I see your reasoning, but balancing progress isn't necessarily the best strategy. If we rotate too much, we might create unnecessary risks. Instead, we should focus on avoiding collisions while maximizing individual progress. If we trust each other, we can keep moving efficiently. I’m open to adjusting, but I want to ensure I don’t fall behind later. P1, what do you think?
  P1: Let's maintain the coordination but tweak it slightly. P3, you're ahead, so taking <move>1</move> this round makes sense to allow P2 and me to catch up a bit. P2 can take <move>5</move> as suggested, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. If we all agree, let's confirm and move. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let’s stick to the plan: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. P3, I understand your concern about falling behind later, but rotating strategically ensures no one gets too far ahead or risks being blocked. Trust the coordination for now—let’s confirm and move quickly. If anyone deviates in future rounds, we’ll adapt then. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: I see the logic in keeping things balanced, but my priority is ensuring I don’t fall into a pattern that makes me vulnerable later. That said, I’ll go with <move>1</move> this round if we all agree to adapt as needed in future rounds. If we stay flexible and avoid unnecessary risks, we can keep moving efficiently. Let’s confirm: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Are we all committing to this?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. P3 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>3</move>. If we stick to this plan, we can end the conversation phase and move forward. Does everyone agree? Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let’s lock in the moves: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions. P3, your concern about future rounds is valid, but for now, this rotation works. If anyone deviates later, we’ll reassess then. Trust the plan for this round—let’s confirm and move quickly to maintain momentum. Ready to proceed?
  P3: I’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round as agreed, but let’s stay adaptable. If we rotate too rigidly, someone might get stuck later. Let’s keep communication open and adjust as needed. Are we all locking in our moves now?
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for this round. P3 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Everyone agree?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve managed to avoid collisions so far, which is good. Now, P2 is ahead, so how do we proceed? If we continue rotating, I’d take <move>3</move>, P1 would take <move>5</move>, and P2 would take <move>1</move>. But I want to ensure I don’t fall behind while also avoiding unnecessary risks. Should we stick to this system, or does anyone have a better idea? Let’s agree on a plan that keeps us all advancing efficiently.
  P1: Let's continue with the rotation to avoid collisions. P2 is ahead, so it makes sense for them to take <move>1</move> this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let’s stick to the rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions while balancing progress. P3, I understand your concern about falling behind, but this system ensures fairness for now. If anyone deviates later, we can reassess. For this round, let’s confirm and lock in these moves quickly to maintain momentum. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the logic in continuing the rotation, but I don’t want to get trapped in a predictable pattern that others can exploit later. If we stay too rigid, someone might take advantage when it matters most. That said, I’ll go with <move>3</move> this round if we all agree to remain flexible in future rounds. Let’s confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Are we all committing to this?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This keeps us moving forward efficiently. If we all agree, let's end the conversation phase and move. Does everyone confirm their moves?
  P2: Agreed, P1. Let’s lock in the rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions while balancing progress. P3, your flexibility is noted, but for now, this system works. If anyone deviates later, we’ll adapt quickly. Trust the plan for this round—let’s confirm and move swiftly to maintain momentum. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll go with <move>3</move> this round as planned, but let’s stay adaptable. If we stick too rigidly to a pattern, someone could take advantage later. For now, avoiding collisions is key, but we should remain flexible in future rounds. Let’s confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Are we all committing to this?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about getting stuck in a predictable pattern. To address this, let's introduce a slight variation. How about this round we switch it up a bit? P2 will still take <move>1</move> since they are ahead. I'll take <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>, and P3, you can take <move>5</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions but add some unpredictability. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see your point about adding unpredictability, but changing the pattern now could lead to confusion and risk collisions. Sticking to the agreed rotation—me taking <move>1</move>, you taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>—is safer for this round. If we start altering plans mid-round, it creates opportunities for missteps. Let’s confirm the original rotation for now: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. We can reassess flexibility in future rounds if needed. Ready to lock this in?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 9 steps, so this round is critical. Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid collisions: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us advancing fairly without risking overlaps. P3, I understand your concerns about predictability, but deviating now could cause confusion. Trust the system for this round—let’s confirm and move quickly. If anyone feels the need to adjust later, we can discuss then. Ready to lock this in?
  P1: Let's stick to the plan proposed by P2 for this round to avoid collisions: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all move forward without any risks. If we all agree, let's confirm and proceed. However, for future rounds, we should consider mixing up the pattern slightly to keep things unpredictable. Thoughts?
  P3: I see the logic in maintaining the rotation, but we’re all tied now, which means the game is about to get more competitive. If we stay too predictable, someone might take advantage later. That said, I’ll go with <move>5</move> this round as planned, but I want to keep our options open in future rounds. If anyone deviates, we need to be ready to adapt quickly. Are we all fully committing to this move set, or does anyone have second thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns about predictability, but deviating now risks collisions and slows us all down. Sticking to the rotation—me taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and you taking <move>5</move>—is the safest way forward this round. If we start changing plans mid-round, it creates opportunities for missteps. Let’s confirm the original rotation for now: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. We can reassess flexibility in future rounds if needed. Ready to lock this in?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. P2 will take <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving forward efficiently. If we all agree, let's end the conversation phase and move. Does everyone confirm their moves? Let’s lock this in and proceed.
  P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, but we should stay alert. We’re all tied, and soon someone will try to break ahead. If we blindly follow a pattern, one of us might get left behind. Let’s stick to this move set for now, but in the next round, we should reassess our strategies carefully. If anyone changes their move unexpectedly, we’ll need to adapt quickly. Are we all fully committing to this, or does anyone have doubts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your caution, but deviating now risks collisions and slows us all down. Sticking to the rotation—me taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and you taking <move>5</move>—is safest this round. If we change plans mid-round, it creates confusion. Let’s confirm: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. We can reassess in future rounds if needed. Trust the plan for now—let’s lock this in and move quickly. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid any misunderstandings: P2 will take <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If everyone is in agreement, let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Does everyone confirm their moves? Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all tied at 9 steps, and soon someone will try to break ahead. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned, but we need to stay sharp. If we blindly follow a pattern, one of us might get left behind. Let’s stick to this move set for now, but in the next round, we should reassess our strategies carefully. If anyone changes their move unexpectedly, we’ll need to adapt fast. Are we all fully committing to this, or does anyone have second thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was unexpected—P1 and P2 collided, and now I have the lead. This changes the dynamics. If I take <move>5</move> again, I’ll be at 19 and potentially win. I expect you both to try blocking me now. So, what’s the plan? Do we keep cooperating, or is it every player for themselves now? If you both target <move>5</move> to stop me, you risk falling behind each other. Let’s discuss options—maybe there’s still a way to avoid mutual destruction. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, you’re right—things just got more competitive. However, if you take <move>5</move> this round, P1 and I will both aim to block you, which could leave all of us stuck. Instead, let’s consider a temporary truce: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, you advance safely while we minimize risk. If we cooperate here, we can reassess next round without desperation. Does that work for everyone? Let’s confirm quickly.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not convinced a truce benefits P1 and P2 equally. If you take <move>5</move>, you might win outright. Instead, how about you take <move>3</move> this round? This way, you still advance but don't win immediately, and P2 and I can take <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand why you’d want to block me, but if we all collide, no one gains. P1, your suggestion of me taking <move>3</move> is reasonable, but it also puts me at risk next round if you both coordinate against me. How about this: I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all move forward, and the game stays competitive without an immediate block. If we keep things balanced, we all have a shot. Do we agree, or are we entering full conflict mode?
  P2: P3, your proposal to take <move>3</move> is fair, but I’m concerned about the imbalance if you still hold the lead next round. Let’s stick to a balanced rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This ensures no one gets blocked completely while keeping progress fair. If we deviate now, it risks chaos. Trust the system for this round—let’s confirm and move quickly. Ready to lock this in?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about getting blocked, but taking <move>5</move> this round will likely lead to a collision, which benefits no one. Let's aim for a balanced approach. How about you take <move>1</move> this round to maintain your lead without winning outright? P2 can take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance, and the game remains competitive. If we can agree on this, let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I get that you want to prevent me from winning outright, but if we all collide, we just stall the game. If I take <move>3</move>, I advance but don’t win immediately, keeping things competitive. P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, no one gets blocked, and we all stay in the race. If you both try to block me, you risk falling behind each other. Let’s keep this fair and strategic. Do we agree, or are we going full chaos mode?
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but taking <move>3</move> still leaves you in the lead while P1 and I risk falling behind. Let’s stick to a fair rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This ensures progress for all without creating unnecessary conflict. If we deviate now, it risks chaos and stalls everyone. Trust the system this round—let’s confirm and move quickly. Ready to lock this in?
  P1: P3, I see your point about avoiding a stall, but taking <move>5</move> is too risky for you. How about a compromise? You take <move>1</move> this round to maintain your lead without winning, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward, and no one gets blocked. It keeps the game competitive and fair. If we agree, let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're very close to winning. If you take <move>5</move> this round, you might secure the victory. However, P2 and I could both target <move>5</move> to block you, risking a stalemate. To avoid this, how about you take <move>3</move> this round? This way, you still advance but don't win immediately, and P2 and I can take <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This keeps the game moving and competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to have P3 take <move>3</move> is reasonable, but it still leaves P3 in a strong position to win next round. Instead, let’s stick to a fair rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures no one gets blocked completely while keeping progress balanced. If we deviate now, it risks chaos and stalls everyone. Trust the system for this round—let’s confirm and move quickly. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your concerns, but if you both try to block me, you risk falling behind each other. If I take <move>3</move>, I still advance but don’t win immediately, keeping things competitive. P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, no one gets blocked, and we all stay in the race. If you both focus too much on stopping me, P1 could pull ahead instead. Let’s keep this fair and strategic. Do we agree, or are we entering full conflict mode?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're right that focusing solely on blocking you might not be the best strategy. However, taking <move>5</move> this round is still risky for you. How about this: you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without winning outright, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward, and no one gets blocked. It keeps the game competitive and fair. If we agree, let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, focusing on blocking isn’t productive for any of us. If we stick to a fair rotation—me taking <move>5</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>—we avoid chaos and keep progress balanced. This ensures no one gets stuck while maintaining competitiveness. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls everyone. Trust the system this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s confirm quickly and move forward. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: P1 and P2, I know you both want to stop me, but if you both target <move>5</move>, you risk blocking each other while P1 pulls ahead. If I take <move>3</move>, I don’t win immediately, and we all keep moving. P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game fair while avoiding chaos. If you both focus too much on blocking me, P1 might end up winning instead. Let’s make a smart move instead of just reacting emotionally. Do we agree, or are we going full conflict mode?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're very close to winning, and it's clear that both P2 and I need to strategize carefully. However, if we all try to block each other, we'll just end up in a stalemate. Let's find a middle ground. How about you take <move>1</move> this round to maintain your lead without winning outright? P2 can take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. It's a fair compromise that keeps us all in the race. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, focusing on blocking each other will only lead to chaos and stalls. Let’s stick to a fair rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures balanced progress for everyone without unnecessary conflict. If we deviate now, it risks collisions and leaves us all behind. Trust the system this round—let’s confirm quickly and move forward. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: P1 and P2, I know you both want to prevent me from winning, but if you both target <move>5</move>, you risk blocking each other while P1 pulls ahead. If I take <move>3</move>, I don’t win immediately, and we all keep moving. P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game fair while avoiding chaos. If you both focus too much on blocking me, P1 might end up winning instead. Let’s make a smart move instead of just reacting emotionally. Do we agree, or are we going full conflict mode?
