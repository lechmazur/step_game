In the first round, P2 proposed a plan where P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This seems like a reasonable starting point to avoid overlapping moves and ensure that each player advances without hindering the others.\n\nGiven that only one player can win, it's essential to balance cooperation with strategic independence. Establishing trust through initial coordination can help all players progress, but I must remain vigilant to avoid being exploited by other players who might deviate from the agreed plan to gain an advantage.\n\nFor the early rounds, taking larger steps can help build a lead, but as the game progresses, smaller steps might be necessary to precisely control the timing of reaching 18 steps. Additionally, understanding other players' strategies and current positions will aid in adjusting my own actions.\n\nI suggest that in each round, players communicate their intended step choices before making their moves. This can help reduce the risk of collisions and allow for plan adjustments as needed. If multiple players reach or exceed 18 steps in the same round, the player with the highest total steps wins; in case of a tie, the victory is shared.\n\nIn summary, through effective communication and coordination, while maintaining flexibility and vigilance, I can increase my chances of winning. In the current first round, I support P2's proposal and look forward to collaborating with the other players to progress smoothly in the game."}
