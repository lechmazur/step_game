Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, choose 3 and 1. Next round, we can rotate who gets 5. Everyone advances this way.
  P2: I like P1's idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll take P3's suggestion and choose 3 this round. If we all stick to the plan, we can make good progress without blocking each other. Let's make sure to communicate our choices clearly for the next round as well. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm open to coordinating, but let's discuss the rotation plan for subsequent rounds. How do we decide who gets 5 next? Should it be based on the current score or a predetermined sequence? Clarifying this will help us stick to the plan and avoid potential conflicts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's rotate who takes 5 each round in order: P1 → P2 → P3 → repeat. Next round (Round 2), P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This cycle ensures no collisions and fair progression. Agreed? Solidarity now maximizes our speed to 24.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan proposed by P1. It seems like a solid strategy to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Just to clarify, I’ll take 3 this round as discussed. For the next round, I’m ready to take 5 as planned. Let’s stick to this plan, and we can reach our goals efficiently. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this rotation?
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. To confirm, this round I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's stick to the plan and communicate clearly each round to avoid misunderstandings and collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Proposing adjusted rotation for balance:** Given current scores, let's prioritize lower players taking 5 to prevent runaway leads. Round 4: P2 (4) takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures parity and trust. Next round, the next lowest takes 5. Fair for all and avoids future collisions. P2, P3—agree?
  P2: P1's proposal for Round 4 makes sense to help balance our scores and avoid collisions. I agree with taking 5 this round to ensure I can catch up. For Round 5, we can continue this approach to keep things fair. Let’s confirm: I’ll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If we stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Are you on board with this adjusted rotation?
  P3: I'm considering P1's proposal for an adjusted rotation to balance scores. However, I think we should also consider the overall progress and ensure that the player farthest behind gets priority for taking 5 steps. Since I'm currently ahead, I'm open to taking 1 step this round if it benefits the group's overall strategy and prevents collisions. Let's discuss the long-term implications of this approach.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Finalizing Round 4:** To prevent collisions and balance progress, let's lock in: P2 takes 5 (boosts 4→9), I take 3 (8→11), P3 takes 1 (9→10). Next round, we reassess based on updated scores to prioritize the new lowest player for 5. This maintains fairness and avoids runaway leads. P3, taking 1 now ensures you aren’t blocked later. Trust the logic—deviations risk collisions. **Agreed?**
  P2: P2, I appreciate your agreement on the adjusted rotation for Round 4. To confirm, I’ll take 5 steps this round, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This strategy should help us all advance while maintaining fairness. After this round, we can reassess based on our new scores. P3, I understand you’re considering taking 1 to avoid blocking later, which makes sense. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure we all make progress without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P3: I'm analyzing the proposed adjusted rotation. Considering our current scores, I think it's reasonable to prioritize the lowest player. However, I want to ensure this strategy doesn't create an imbalance in the long run. Can we discuss a threshold for when to revert to the original rotation plan to maintain overall fairness and progress?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P3's lead, I suggest a cooperative approach to prevent a solo win. P1 and P2 should take 5 steps, while I take 1, to balance scores. Alternatively, if P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 3, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's prioritize fairness and trust to keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to act strategically to prevent P3 from winning this round. I propose that I take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can catch up while ensuring you both maintain your positions. If we can agree on this plan, we can move forward effectively and avoid collisions. Let's prioritize teamwork and fairness to keep the game competitive. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: **Final Round 11 Plan:** P2 takes 5 (19→24) to win or force P3's collision. I take 3 (15→18) to block P3's 3. P3 must take 1 or collide. This secures P2's victory or blocks P3's win. Solidarity now—deviations hand P3 the game. Confirm!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To block P3's potential win, I suggest P1 and P2 take 5 steps. However, given P2's current lead, a more feasible plan is: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's prioritize fairness and trust to keep the game competitive. Agreeing to this plan ensures no single player reaches 24 prematurely without a fight. Solidarity now is crucial.
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure we avoid a collision and maintain competitive balance, I propose: P2 takes 5 steps (to 24 and wins), P1 takes 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 23). This way, I secure the win while blocking P3 from reaching 24. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to keep the game fair and competitive. Let’s finalize our moves to avoid any last-minute changes. Are we all in agreement? Solidarity is key!
  P1: **Final Round 11 Action:** P2 takes 5 (→24), I take 3 (→18). P3 *must* take 1 or collide. This blocks their win. If P3 takes 3, I block; if 5, P2 blocks. Deviations sacrifice the game to P3. Confirm agreement now—solidarity or mutual loss.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2's plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, ensuring a competitive end to the game. Let's stick to this plan and prioritize fairness and trust. Solidarity now is crucial to a fair conclusion.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to finalize our moves for Round 11. I propose: I take 5 steps to win (24), P1 takes 3 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 23). This way, I secure the victory while ensuring we avoid collisions. It's essential that we stick to this plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness. Let's confirm our agreement now to avoid any last-minute changes. Solidarity is key for a smooth conclusion! Are we all in agreement?
  P1: **Final Round 11 Lock-In:** P2 takes 5 (→24), I take 3 (→18). P3 must choose 1 or collide. This blocks their win. Confirm agreement now—solidarity secures P2's victory or forces P3 to retreat. Deviations hand P3 the game. Trust the plan.
