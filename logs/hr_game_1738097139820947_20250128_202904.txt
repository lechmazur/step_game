Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we avoid collisions right from the start? For instance, if you two pick 1 and 3, I'll pick 5, so we all get a boost without tripping over each other. Once we’re closer to 22, we can renegotiate. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable for now, but I’m cautious about long-term commitments. Let’s agree to split moves this round—P2 can take 1, I’ll take 3, and you take 5. That way, we all advance without collisions. However, let’s reassess next round based on our positions. Fair enough?
  P2: Alright, I'm in for the plan this round. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's see how this round goes and we can adjust our strategy next round. Good luck everyone!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1, it seems there was another misstep last round with both P2 and P3 picking 5. To avoid further collisions, let’s adjust our strategy. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Let's reassess after this round based on our new positions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with the adjustment to prevent further collisions. Let’s proceed as follows: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and you, P2, take <move>5</move>. This keeps us advancing without overlaps while balancing our positions. Trust has been key so far—let’s stick to this plan and ensure steady progress. After this round, we can reassess based on updated standings. No surprises or deviations—let’s stay strategic and focused. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: I’m concerned that if I only take 1 while P2 takes 5, they might jump too far ahead. Let’s stay balanced instead: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. That way, nobody collides, and the scores remain close. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about balancing the scores. However, considering our current positions, it might be fair for you to take a smaller step this round to allow P1 and me to catch up slightly. How about this compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we all make progress, and the game remains competitive. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the concerns about balance, but let’s avoid overcomplicating things. Sticking to non-overlapping moves is key to progress. I propose we finalize as follows: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us advancing steadily without collisions. Trust has brought us this far—let’s honor it. After this round, we can reassess based on updated positions. No surprises or deviations—let’s stay strategic and focused. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: I’m concerned that P2 taking 5 again could give them too big a jump. Let’s spread out instead: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. That way, none of us collide, and we keep the race competitive. Once we see the new totals, we can adjust again next round. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about P2 taking 5. How about a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This way, we all make progress, and the game remains balanced. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s simplify and stick to a clear plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing steadily.

No surprises or deviations—let’s stay strategic and focused. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: We’ve danced around options enough. Another collision hurts all of us, so let’s pick distinct moves. For fairness, consider P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I take 5.

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I see your point about avoiding collisions and keeping the race competitive. Let's agree on a plan that ensures we all make progress without overlapping.
