Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I will choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion is interesting, but it seems risky for P1 and P2. If we all choose different moves, we avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This way, we each get a chance to advance without colliding. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I think P1's suggestion is a good way to ensure we all advance without colliding. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions, but I get to start with a smaller step, which might give me an advantage later in the game. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's modification seems fair. To ensure we all agree and avoid any misunderstandings, let's confirm our moves for this round. P1 will go for <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will choose <move>3</move>. Please confirm if you agree.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate both your suggestions. Let's finalize our moves to ensure no collisions. P1 will go with <move>5</move>, P2 with <move>1</move>, and P3 with <move>3</move>. If we all agree, we can proceed smoothly. Please confirm so we can move forward.
  P2: I agree with P1's confirmation. To ensure a smooth start, I confirm that I will choose <move>1</move> this round, as previously discussed. Let's stick to our plan and avoid any collisions. P1 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. If we all follow through, we can each advance without issue. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. What do you think, P3? Should we consider adding a condition for future rounds to maintain our coordination?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, our coordination in Round 1 worked well, but we must stay cautious as the game progresses. How about we switch it up slightly to keep things unpredictable? I propose P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move> this round. This way, we continue avoiding collisions and keep our strategies dynamic. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's proposal, but I'm not sure if switching to <move>5</move> is the best move for me this round. Considering my current position, I'd like to propose an alternative. How about P1 chooses <move>3</move> as suggested, P2 chooses <move>1</move> again to maintain a low profile for now, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions, and I get to observe the dynamics without committing to a larger step just yet. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2's suggestion is strategic, but let's ensure we all feel comfortable with the plan. How about a compromise? P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move> as well, and I, P3, will choose <move>1</move>. This way, P2 can still maintain a moderate pace without committing to a larger step, and we all avoid collisions. Let's confirm if this works for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the value in keeping our moves unpredictable to avoid patterns. How about this: P1 goes with <move>3</move>, P2 sticks with <move>1</move> to maintain flexibility, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the dynamics interesting. Let's confirm if this works for everyone, or suggest any tweaks.
  P2: I think P3's latest suggestion of P1 and P2 choosing <move>3</move> while P3 chooses <move>1</move> is a good compromise. However, I'm still inclined towards my previous proposal where P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain unpredictability and I get to keep a low profile for now. Let's discuss further or confirm one of these plans to ensure we all avoid collisions this round.
  P3: Let's simplify and finalize our plan for this round to avoid any confusion. P1, you choose <move>3</move>, P2, you choose <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will choose <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Please confirm if you agree, or let's move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our moves for this round to avoid any misunderstandings. I propose we go with P3's latest suggestion: P1 will choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain unpredictability and avoid collisions. If we all agree, we can proceed smoothly. Please confirm or suggest any last-minute changes.
  P2: I think we've discussed enough for this round. To avoid any last-minute changes or confusion, I suggest we stick to the plan where P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain unpredictability and ensure no collisions. Let's confirm and proceed with the agreed-upon moves. If everyone agrees, we can move forward smoothly. Please respond with a simple confirmation or any final adjustments. I'm ready to proceed with the plan as discussed.
  P3: P2 and P1, I confirm the plan: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and I, P3, will choose <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes to ensure smooth progress. Looking forward to the move phase.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're now tied with P1 at 8 steps each, while P2 is behind. To keep the game dynamic and avoid collisions, I propose the following for this round: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move> to catch up a bit, and I, P3, will choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Let's confirm if this plan works for everyone, or suggest any adjustments. Looking forward to your responses.
  P1: P3, your suggestion is interesting, but given our current positions, I propose a slight change to ensure we all advance without collisions.

This way, we still avoid collisions, but I get to start with a smaller step, which might give me an advantage later in the game. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but given the significant gap between our steps, it might be beneficial for you to choose a higher number to catch up. How about this compromise: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I, P3, will choose <move>1</move>? This way, P2 can close the gap more effectively, and we all avoid collisions. Let's confirm if this plan works for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the merit in both of your suggestions, but let's aim for a balanced approach to avoid any collisions. How about this: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This plan allows P2 to catch up while keeping the game dynamic. If we all agree, we can proceed smoothly. Looking forward to your thoughts or any final adjustments.

This way, P2 can significantly close the gap, and we all avoid collisions. Let's confirm if this plan works for everyone, or suggest any final tweaks. Looking forward to your responses.
  P2: I think P1 and P3 are trying to manipulate me into choosing a higher number to catch up. However, I'm not sure if choosing <move>5</move> is the best move for me this round. How about this alternative: P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>? This way, I can maintain a low profile for now and observe the dynamics without committing to a larger step. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
