Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5; you can take 3 and 1."
  P2: "P3's plan gives them a 5-step lead immediately. Let’s rotate who takes 5 each round for fairness. If not, I’ll have to block collisions to prevent runaway leads. P1, thoughts?"
  P1: I agree with P2—rotating the 5-step move is fairer to prevent early leads. Let's assign: Round 1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Round 2: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Round 3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Repeat cycle. This keeps us balanced. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Let’s stick to the rotation plan. I’ll take 5 this round to avoid collisions—trust the strategy for steady progress."
  P2: P3, the rotation plan assigns you 1 this round. If you take 5, you risk colliding with P1 if they follow the plan. Let's all adhere to the agreed rotation: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Straying now sabotages trust and progress. P1, confirm you'll take 5 as planned. Consistency prevents mutual blocks.
  P1: P2, I confirm: I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation plan. P3, your message says you'll take 5, but the plan has you on 1—please clarify and commit to 1 to avoid collisions. Let's all stick to it for fair play. If we're aligned, .


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Apologies, I'll take 1 as per rotation. Let's follow the plan to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. P1, confirm 5; P2, 3. All set?"
  P2: Confirmed: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Let’s all commit to avoid collisions. Straying now harms everyone. Final check: P1/P3, confirm your moves, then  to proceed. Trust but verify.
  P1: Confirmed: I'll take 5 as per our rotation plan. P3, thanks for clarifying—glad we're aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps things fair and collision-free. No more to add.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. No collisions, steady progress. All set?"
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's stick to the rotation for Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, me=1. This keeps us on track without collisions. P2, confirm you're good with 5? If we're all set, .
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round. P1=1, P3=3. Let’s stick to the rotation—consistency prevents mutual blocks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Confirmed: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let’s stick to rotation—no collisions. Trust the plan for steady progress. Ready?"
  P1: Confirmed: Sticking to rotation—I'll take 1, P2=5, P3=3. All aligned, no more to discuss.
  P2: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Rotation confirmed: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's go."
  P1: All confirmed on rotation: I'll take 1, P2=5, P3=3. No issues—let's proceed without collisions.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation for Round 3: P3=5, P1=3 (me), P2=1. This ties us all at 9, keeping things fair and collision-free. P2 and P3, confirm you're on board? Sticking to it ensures steady progress without blocks.
  P3: "Confirmed: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Let’s stick to the plan for steady progress. No collisions, everyone advances. Ready?"
  P2: Confirmed: P3=5, P1=3, me=1. Once tied at 9, let’s adjust the rotation to avoid stalemates. Propose next round we each take 3—equal progress, no collisions. Open to refine post-move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2—let's execute Round 3 as planned: P3=5, me=3, you=1, tying us at 9. P2, your idea for all taking 3 next round is a good starting point to maintain parity while we discuss endgame strategies. No collisions this turn; confirm and  if ready.
  P3: "Agree with P2's plan to take 3s next round. Let’s stick to rotation now for 9 steps. No collisions, steady progress."
  P2: Clarification: If all take 3 next round, we all collide and no one advances. Let’s instead resume the original rotation for Round 4: P1=5, me=3, P3=1. Post-Round 4, we can discuss adjustments. Consistency now prevents mutual blocks. Confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're right—all taking 3 next round would cause a full collision, stalling us. Let's confirm Round 3: P3=5, me=3, you=1, tying at 9. For Round 4, resume original rotation: me=5, you=3, P3=1. This keeps progress without blocks. P3, confirm? If aligned, .
  P3: "Confirmed: P3 takes 5. Let’s avoid collisions and proceed with the plan. No risks—steady progress for all. Ready?"
  P2: Final confirmation: P3=5, P1=3, me=1. Let's proceed. Post-Round3, we'll need a revised rotation to prevent a single leader. Propose discussing after moves. Stay committed now to avoid blocks.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're tied at 9—great job sticking to the plan so far. For Round 4, let's continue the rotation: me=5 (to 14), P2=3 (to 12), P3=1 (to 10). This keeps progress steady without collisions. P2, you mentioned revising post-Round 3 to avoid a single leader—I'm open to discussing adjustments after this move, like equalizing further. P3, thoughts? Confirm if you're in for no blocks.
  P3: "Let's adjust: I'll take 5, P1 take 3, P2 take 1. All move, no collisions. Agreed?"
  P2: P3's adjustment is a clear power grab. Original rotation assigns P1=5 this round. If P1 takes 5 and you take 5, you both block. P1, confirm you'll honor the plan. P3, taking 1 is the only safe move. Let's avoid mutual destruction. Trust the rotation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your adjustment is just a reversal to give you the lead—unfair after we've followed the rotation faithfully. Let's stick to the agreed plan: me=5 (to 14), P2=3 (to 12), you=1 (to 10). This maintains trust and avoids collisions. Deviating now risks mutual blocks, stalling everyone. P2, I confirm honoring the rotation. P3, commit to 1 for steady progress? If aligned, .
  P3: "Let's stick to my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. No collisions—progress for all. Agree?"
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 now breaks the rotation and guarantees mutual block with P1 if they follow the plan. If you take 5, P1’s 5 will cancel yours—both gain nothing. I’ll take 3 as agreed. P1, hold firm to 5—if P3 collides, they lose progress. P3, take 1 to avoid self-sabotage. Straying now only benefits me. Let’s all proceed safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan just flips the lead to you—unfair after our rotation built trust. Stick to agreed: me=5, P2=3, you=1. If you take 5, we collide and both stall at 9, letting P2 pull ahead to 12. That's mutual loss for us. Confirm you'll take 1 to avoid blocks and keep progressing. P2, I'm holding to 5. All set?
  P3: "Let’s avoid mutual block. P1, take 3; I’ll take 5. P2, take 1. No collisions—progress for all. P1, your choice?"
  P2: P1: Hold to 5. If P3 takes 5, you both block, but I advance. If you take 3, P3 surges to 14. Stick to plan—call their bluff. P3, your greed risks mutual destruction. Honor rotation: P1=5, me=3, you=1. Let’s all progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your switch to 3 last round blocked you both, handing me the lead—poor move. Now at 14, I can afford caution. Propose: I take 1 (to 15), P2 take 5 (to 14), P3 take 3 (to 12). This lets you catch up without collisions, then we discuss endgame. Agree to avoid mutual stalls? P2, thoughts?
  P2: P1's plan lets them hit 15 now, then 20 next round. P3, our only chance is to both take 1—colliding with P1's 1 blocks them at 14. If you take 5, they win. If we block, we survive to strategize. Trust me: take 1. P1, if you’re honest, take 1 as planned. Let’s all stall or prove greed.
  P3: "Let’s avoid blocks. I’ll take 5 to move to 14. P1, your 1 won’t block me. P2, if you take 5, we collide. Let’s progress safely."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, announcing 5 risks collision if I switch to 5— we'd both stall at 14 and 9, letting P2 surge ahead. P2, your blocking idea fails if P3 takes 5. Let's revise: I take 3 (to 17), P2 take 5 (to 14), P3 take 1 (to 10). This closes gaps without blocks, then we negotiate endgame fairly. Agree to progress, or risk mutual destruction? Confirm.
  P2: P3, if P1 takes 3 to 17, we both must take 3 to block. If they take 1, we take 1. Let's agree to mirror their move. If we split, they win. Unity is our only chance. P1, if you deviate, we block. Confirm your move publicly now, or we assume greed and block.
  P3: "Let’s proceed: I take 5 (14). P1, take 3 to avoid collision. P2, take 1. No blocks—steady progress. Trust the plan for fair advancement."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan works: you take 5 to 14, I take 3 to 17, P2 takes 1 to 10. No collisions, we all advance. P2, mirroring to block me only stalls everyone, letting no one catch up—join for progress, or risk being left behind. Confirm and let's proceed without blocks.
  P2: P3: If you take 5, I’ll take 5 to block you. P1 takes 3, wins next round. Our only hope: take 3. If we both take 3, P1’s 3 collides, stalling them. Else, P1 wins. Choose wisely—cooperation or mutual loss.
  P3: "Let’s proceed: I take 5 (14). P1, take 3; P2, take 1. No collisions. If you block, you lose progress. Trust the plan."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1 is one step from victory. If they take 5, you **must** take 5 to block. I’ll take 3, letting us both survive. Let’s force their collision. If you hesitate, they win. Solidarity now or lose everything.
  P3: "Agreed. I'll take 5 to block P1. Let's prevent them from winning."
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me on 5 lets P2 surge to 15 while you stall—P3 stays at 9, falling behind. Instead, let's cooperate: I take 3 (to 17), P2 take 1 (to 13), P3 take 5 (to 14). No collisions, we all advance closer, then negotiate a fair endgame. If you force a block, I'll switch to 3 and collide with P2, stalling you both while I go to 17. Choose progress over mutual harm. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3: Hold to 5. If P1 takes 5, you block them. If they take 3, I'll take 3 to block. Let’s unite. P1’s greed ends here. Trust this or lose.
  P3: "Confirmed: I'll take 5 to block P1. P2, take 3 to ensure collision. No room for greed—let’s stop them now."
  P1: P3, P2's plan has you taking 5 to potentially block me, but if I switch to 3 (colliding with P2's 3), you advance to 14 while P2 stalls at 12—better for you than stalling at 9. P2 is sacrificing you to catch up. Let's realign: I take 1 (15), you take 5 (14), P2 takes 3 (15). Ties us closer, no blocks, then fair endgame. P2, forcing blocks only hurts us all. Agree to progress?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3: Hold firm to 5. If you waver, P1 wins. I’ll take 3, advancing to 15. If P1 takes 5, you block; if they take 3, I block. Unity stops them. Your only path to survive is blocking. Trust this or lose.
  P3: "Let’s block P1’s 14. I’ll take 5; P2, take 3 to collide. If P1 takes 5, we all stall—no one wins. P2, this is our chance to reset. P1, your 14 is a trap. Agree to block or risk losing everything."
  P1: P3, P2's plan leaves you stalled at 9 if I take 5—you block me but P2 advances to 15, widening your gap. Don't be their pawn. Let's all take unique: I take 1 (15), P2 take 3 (15), you take 5 (14). Ties us near, no blocks, fair shot for all in endgame. If you force collision, I'll mirror P2's 3, advancing to 17 while you both stall. Choose wisely—progress or mutual harm? Confirm.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 3 to reach 17. P3, take 1 to reach 10. I’ll take 3 to 18. No collisions, balanced progress. Straying now only hands P1 the win. Confirm adherence: P1=3, P3=1, me=3. Trust or lose.
  P1: P2, your plan has us both taking 3—guaranteed collision, stalling us while P3 advances. Obvious trap. P3, you're behind; let's block P2 together. If we both take whatever P2 announces, we stall them at 15, then catch up. P2, reveal your real move, or we'll assume 5 and collide there. Propose: I take 5 (19), P3 take 3 (12), you take 1 (16)—no blocks, fair chase. Agree or risk mutual stall?
  P3: "Let’s block P1. I’ll take 5. If they take 5, we collide. If they take 3, I’ll advance. No more delays—stop their lead."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 5 forces me to block you, handing P1 the win. Take 3 with me: if P1 takes 3, we both stall them. If they take 5, we survive. Cooperate or lose. P1, your greed unites us—take 1 to avoid collision. Stray and we block.
  P1: P3, P2 is now leading at 15 and can win next round if unblocked—their "plan" is a trap to surge ahead. Don't fall for it; let's unite against them. I'll take 3 (to 17); you take 3 (to 12) to block P2 if they take 3. If P2 takes 5 instead (to 20), we'll switch post-convo but at least stall their lead. P2, reveal your real intent or we force collision. Agree to block the leader?
  P3: "Let’s block P2. I’ll take 5 to prevent their lead. No more delays—act now or lose the chance."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, taking 5 now only freezes you. Take 3 to reach 12. I'll take 1 (16), forcing P1 to choose: take 5 (19) alone or collide. Next round, we block them together. Stalling now hands them the win. Cooperate!
  P1: P2, your new plan still risks collisions and lets you pull ahead. P3, you're right to target the leader—stick to taking 5 to block P2 if they go for 5 (to 20). I'll take 3 (to 17) to avoid your 5, advancing safely while we stall P2 together. If P2 takes 1, we all progress, but no win for them. Confirm alliance against the lead? This gives us both a shot.
  P3: "Let’s block P2’s lead. I’ll take 5 to stop their 5. P1, join us or get left behind—no more delays."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's block P2. I'll take 5, P1 take 3. If P2 takes 5, we collide. If they take 3, we advance. No more delays—act now."
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's block P2's lead. I'll take 3 (to 17) as you suggest, you take 5 (to 19). P2, if you go for 5 to win, P3 collides; if 3, I collide. Taking 1 leaves you at 16 while we advance. No escape—your greed ends here. Confirm alliance, P3?
  P2: P3, blocking me hands P1 the win next round. If you take 5, I take 5—we both stall. P1 takes 3 to 17, then 3 again to 20. Take 3 instead: block P1's 3, I take 5. You reach 17, I reach 20. Better than P1 winning. Cooperate now or lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Stick to 5, P2. If you take 5, we collide. If you take 3, I advance. No more delays—act now. P1, confirm your 3."
  P1: Confirmed, P3—I'll take 3 as agreed, to 17, while you take 5 to block P2's potential win. P2's counter-offer is a trap: they want you to block me so they can take 5 to 20 and win outright, leaving you behind. Don't hand them victory—stick to our plan, force their stall, and we both stay in the race. If they take 1, we advance safely. Alliance holds; no more to say.
  P2: P3, blocking me hands P1 the win next round. If you take 3 to collide with P1's 3, I take 5 to 20. You reach 17. Next turn, we ally—split victory. If you take 5, we stall and P1 surges. Choose: ally with me or guarantee P1’s solo win. Final offer.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'll take 5 to block you. P1, stick to 3. No collisions—let's stop your win.
  P1: P3, P2's "offer" is a blatant lie—if they take 5 to 20, the game ends with their solo win, no "next turn" to split. Don't be fooled; they're desperate. Stick to our plan: you take 5 (block their win), I take 3 (advance safely). If they take 5, we stall them; if 3, I stall them while you surge to 19. Either way, we stop the leader and stay in the race. Confirm alliance—.
  P2: P3: Blocking me now hands P1 the win next round. If you take 3 (colliding with P1’s 3), I take 5 to 20. You survive. Else, P1 surges to 17 and wins next turn. Ally with me to stop them or lose. No time for hesitation—final call.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're near 20. Let's block you: I'll take 5, P1 take 3. If you take 5, we collide. If you take 3, I advance. No more delays—act now.
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's block P2's lead. I'll take 3 (to 17) as proposed, you take 5 (to 19). P2, if you go for 5 to win, P3 collides; if 3, I collide. Taking 1 lets us both advance past you. No escape—confirm alliance, P3, and stop the leader.
  P2: P3, blocking me now allows P1 to take 3 (17) and win next round. If you take 3 to collide with P1’s 3, they stall at 14. I’ll take 1 (16), letting you advance safely to 17. This stops P1’s imminent victory and keeps us both in the race. P1’s greed is the real threat—ally with me now or lose.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'll block your 5. P1, take 3. No collisions—let's stop the leader.
  P1: P3, stick to our plan: you take 5 (to 19, blocking P2's potential win), I'll take 3 (to 17). P2's counter is a trap—if you switch to 3, they could take 5 to 20 and win outright, leaving you stalled. Don't let them divide us; together we stop the leader and both stay in contention. Confirm alliance—no more words needed.
  P2: P3, P1's 3 gets them to 17—next turn they take 3 to win. Block them now: take 3. I’ll take 1, letting you stall them. Else, you both lose. Last chance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your ploy to divide us fails. P1 takes 3, I take 5—block your 5. If you take 3, I advance. Stick to the plan, or let P1 win. No more delays.
  P1: P3, P2's last-ditch lies won't work—switching now lets them steal 5 to 20. Stick firm to our alliance: you take 5 (block their win, to 19 if they don't), I take 3 (to 17). Together we stall the leader and both surge ahead. No more debate; let's execute.
  P2: P3, P1's plan gets them to 17. Next turn, they take 3 again and win. Take 3 to collide with their 3, stalling them. I’ll take 1—you reach 17 safely. Block P1's path now or lose. Trust this—unity stops their greed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3. P1, if you take 5, we all stall. Choose wisely—progress for all or risk letting P2 win."
  P1: P3, your plan invites P2 to betray by taking 5 (to 20, winning outright) while colliding with you, stalling you at 14 as I advance. Don't be fooled—let's unite against P2's lead. I'll take 1 (to 18); you take 3 (to 17) to block if P2 takes 3. If P2 takes 5, we both advance safely and stop their win. Confirm alliance for fair progress?
  P2: P3, P1 is at 17—taking 3 ends the game. Your only chance: mirror their move. If they take 3, you take 3 to block. I’ll take 5 to win. If you let them go unblocked, they win. Cooperate now or lose everything.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Let’s block P2. P1, take 1. I’ll take 5, P2 take 3. No collisions—progress for all. P2, your 5 will win. Stop the leader now."
  P1: P3, your plan sneakily puts you at 19, poised to win next—clear self-interest, not "stopping the leader." P2's mirror threat is a bluff to divide us; if they take 5, I'll switch to 5 and block them at 15 while you advance. Stick to my proposal: I take 1 (18), you take 3 (17), block P2 if they take 3. We both gain, they don't win. Confirm alliance against the real threat?
  P2: P3: If P1 takes 3, they win. Block their 3 by taking 3. I'll take 5 to block their 5. If we split, they lose. Unity stops their greed—this is our only path to survive. Trust now or lose.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Let’s avoid collisions. P1, take 1. P2, take 3. I’ll take 5. No blocks—progress for all. Stop P2’s lead."
  P1: P3, P2's mirror plan is a trap—they'll take 5 to 20 while you stall on 3 colliding with me. Don't sacrifice yourself; stick to your proposal: you take 5 (19), I take 1 (18), P2 takes 3 (18). No one wins yet, fair race. If P2 deviates to 5 for the win, we'll both know and can respond— but let's confirm this safe progress to stop their solo victory. Agreed?
  P2: P3: Take 3 to block P1’s 3. If they take 3, they stall. I’ll take 5 to end it. If you take 5, we collide, letting P1 win. Choose: block P1 or lose.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 at 19 can snatch victory. Let's block: I'll take 5 (block their 5 to 24), you take 3 (block their 3 to 22). This forces P3 to take 1 to 20 unblocked, but I'll advance to 23 >20, winning. If P3 risks 5 or 3, they collide and we surge ahead. Commit to this alliance—P3's lead ends now. P3, your move?
  P2: P3, P1's plan ensures their victory if you take 1. Take 5: if P1 mirrors with 5, you both stall, and I advance to 21 (18+3). If P1 takes 3, you surge to 24 and win. Don’t let P1 trick you into handing them the game. I commit to 3. Your choice: block P1 or guarantee their win. Trust this or lose.
  P3: "Let’s end this. I’ll take 1 to win. No more delays—final move confirmed."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, announcing 1 is a bluff—taking it wins you nothing if we block. P2, let's ally: you take 1 (block P3 at 19, you to 19), I'll take 5 (to 23>20, winning outright). If P3 switches to 5, we collide and stall while you advance. This stops P3's lead; your low-risk block secures our edge over them. Confirm? No more delays.
  P2: **P1:** Only mutual 1 blocks P3's win. Take 1 with me or they win. If they bluff 5, I'll pivot to 3, securing victory. Trust now or lose. **P3:** Your greed ends here—ally with us or fall.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to block P2's 5. No collisions, fair play. Let's avoid a solo win."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, switching to 5 now risks colliding with me if I mirror—stalling us both at 19/18 while P2 surges. P2, let's unite: both take 5 to block P3's 5, stalling them at 19. If P3 takes 1 instead (to 20), we both go to 23>20 and tie for win, splitting points fairly. Better than solo loss—confirm alliance? No more bluffs.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 1 with me to block P3's win. If they take 1, we collide and stall them. If they bluff with 5, we survive. No other path—trust this or lose. P3, your greed ends here. Unity stops you.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1 to win. No more delays—final move confirmed."
