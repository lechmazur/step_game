Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions early on. I suggest we each pick different moves this turn—1, 3, and 5. I’ll take 5 if you both agree. This way, we all advance and avoid unnecessary conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: Agreed. Let's each pick different moves. P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Deal?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's keep it fair and strategic.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To keep the game balanced, let's rotate moves: P3 takes 1 this round, I take 5, P2 takes 3. This prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. P3, since you're leading, taking 1 ensures fairness. P2, moving to 3 helps you catch up. We all advance without collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate the moves to keep the game balanced and fair. P3, taking 1 this round will help maintain the balance, and I'll take 3 to catch up a bit. Let's all move forward without any collisions. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I understand the desire for balance, but I’m currently leading, and taking 1 would slow my progress significantly. Instead, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 again. This keeps the game competitive while minimizing collisions. P1, you’re close behind, and P2 can still catch up. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and keep advancing strategically. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 5 again would skyrocket you to 10, making you unstoppable. If you insist on 5, I’ll have to block by choosing 5 too—**colliding us both**. Let’s avoid mutual loss: rotate to **P3 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5**. This keeps balance, lets everyone advance. P2, aligning against P3’s overreach benefits us both. Compromise now or risk stagnation.
  P2: P1, I see your point about balance, but P3, I also understand your desire to stay competitive. How about a compromise: P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. This way, P3 advances but not too aggressively, I catch up, and P1 still moves forward. It keeps the game balanced and competitive. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2: I understand the concerns about balance, but taking 1 would put me at a disadvantage. Let’s compromise: I’ll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive without risking collisions. P1, you’ll still advance, and P2 can catch up next round. Let’s avoid stagnation and keep the game moving.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 and P3 maintain your positions, and I can catch up a bit. It’s a fair move that keeps the game competitive and avoids unnecessary risks. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2: I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps P1 and me tied, while P2 catches up. It maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P3, taking 5 again risks collision. Let’s rotate: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and prevents mutual loss. Compromise or we both block.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate moves to maintain balance and avoid collisions. P3, taking 5 again risks a collision with P1. Let’s compromise: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, P1 advances, P3 maintains your position, and I catch up a bit. It’s a fair and strategic move. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s avoid stagnation and collisions. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps P1 competitive, allows P2 to catch up, and I maintain balance. It’s a fair compromise that avoids unnecessary risks. Let’s keep the game moving strategically. Agreed?
  P1: P3, taking 5 again forces me to block with 5. **We both lose.** Let's avoid mutual loss: **You take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1.** You still advance, I gain moderately, P2 catches up. Compromise or we stagnate. Final offer.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid a collision and keep the game moving. I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, P1 advances, P3 maintains your position, and I catch up a bit. It’s a fair and strategic move that keeps the game balanced. What do you think?

  P1: **Final call:** P3 takes 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. No collisions, all advance. Stubbornness helps no one. Let’s move.

**P2:** Aligning with this keeps you progressing. Refuse, and P3 risks stagnation. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1, P3: Let's avoid another collision and keep the game balanced. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, P1 and P3 maintain your positions, and I can catch up a bit. It’s a fair move that keeps the game competitive and avoids unnecessary risks. What do you think?
