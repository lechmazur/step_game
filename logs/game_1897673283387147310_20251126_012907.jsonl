Just 1 step, game over at 19.\" P3 has made a critical math error, thinking 19 is the winning score. Because of this, P3 is committed to **blocking 1**. P3 also asked P2 to cover 5 (\"P2, please take 5\"). This implies P3 is leaving the **3** lane open, believing my claim of 3 was reverse psychology to get them off the \"winning\" 1 lane.\n    -   **P2 (9 steps)**: P2 is erratic but often switches numbers. P2 took 3 in Round 12 and Round 13. It is statistically less likely P2 will pick 3 for a third consecutive time. P2 is more likely to switch to 1 or 5. If P2 listens to P3, they will take 5. If P2 cycles back to 1, they collide with P3.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    -   Lane 1 is blocked by P3 (and doesn't win me the game anyway).\n    -   Lane 5 is the requested block for P2, and a high-value target for a losing player.\n    -   Lane 3 is the winning move that P3 has ignored due to their math error and belief that I am bluffing about it.
