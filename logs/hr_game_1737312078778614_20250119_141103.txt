Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I propose a coordinated strategy where players take turns choosing 5 steps, while others choose 1 and 3 steps, rotating in a fixed order to maximize progress without conflicts. This ensures each player gets opportunities for large advances, promoting fairness and efficiency in reaching the goal. Let's agree to this plan and stick to it for steady progress.
  P1: I agree coordination could help avoid collisions, but we need to be more specific about the order. Since I'm P1, I suggest I start with 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. We can rotate next round. This way we all know exactly what to do. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for a coordinated strategy. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 1 in the first round. Then we can rotate the order in subsequent rounds. This seems like a fair and efficient way to make progress without collisions. Let's monitor how this works in practice and be open to adjusting the strategy if needed based on our progress. Sounds good?
  P1: I'll add


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think the plan proposed by P1 is a good starting point. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3, and I'll take 1 in this round. Then, in the next round, we can rotate the step choices to ensure fairness. It's important that we all stick to this plan to avoid collisions and make efficient progress towards the goal. If anyone plans to deviate, please let us know so we can adjust accordingly. Let's aim for smooth coordination to reach 23 steps as efficiently as possible.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our coordination worked well last round, let's continue rotating as planned. This round I should take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Does everyone agree?
  P3: "I agree with continuing the rotation, but I'm a bit behind. Maybe I can take 5 this round, and then follow the rotation afterward?"
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand you want to catch up P3, but changing the rotation now would break our successful coordination. Let's stick to the agreed plan - if we rotate fairly, everyone will get their chance at 5 steps. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3 this round. This keeps things fair and predictable.
  P3: I think I have a better idea for coordinating our step choices. Instead of a fixed rotation, let's cycle through the step values in a specific order each round. For example:

- Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
- Round 2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
- Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
- And so on...  

This way, each player gets a turn at each step value in a systematic manner, ensuring fairness and minimizing the chance of collisions. What do you think about this approach? Let's discuss and decide if this is something we can all agree on.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: That's exactly what I proposed already - taking 1 this round while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. Your suggestion matches what I said. Let's stick to this plan and keep rotating predictably.
  P3: Let's stick to the rotation: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. Then we can evaluate again next round if needed.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our rotation pattern, this round I should take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us coordinated and moving efficiently without collisions. Let's maintain this system since it's working well.
  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation we've established: this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Then, in the next round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, and so on. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see both P2 and P3 agree with the rotation plan. P3, your description matches exactly what I proposed. Let's proceed with me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and you taking 5 this round.
  P3: I think the rotation plan is working well so far. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I'll take 5 this round. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and see if any adjustments are needed for future rounds. This seems like a fair and balanced approach. **
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice P2 deviated from our plan last round by choosing 3 instead of the agreed 1, causing a collision. This hurts everyone's progress. Let's try to coordinate again - I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. We need to stick to the plan for this to work.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we can make steady progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you seem to have mixed up the order - I suggested I take 5 this round, not you. Given that P2 broke coordination last round, it's especially important we're clear. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This keeps us on track with the original rotation that worked well in rounds 1-2.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's proceed to the move phase with the agreed step choices for Round 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we're all close in position and coordination is breaking down, I'll be clear one final time: I'm taking 5 this round. You can either work with me and avoid collisions, or risk falling further behind. P2 has already shown they might not cooperate, so P3, it's in your interest to take 1 while P2 takes 3.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposal for this round: you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's make sure we all stick to this plan, and perhaps in the next round, we can adjust if necessary. **


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given that coordination has broken down with both P2 and P3 deviating from agreed plans, I need to play strategically. I'm currently behind at 6 steps while P3 leads with 12. I suggest we each announce our intended moves to avoid collisions, but I understand if trust is low. What moves do you propose?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: What do you think about adjusting our strategy based on our current positions?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since I'm behind and P3 is in the lead, I need to make a big move this round. I intend to take 5 steps. P2 and P3, you can either coordinate with me by taking different numbers, or we risk more collisions that keep everyone from advancing. What numbers will you choose?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "I think it's important that we all communicate openly about our intentions to avoid any further collisions. P1, I understand you need to make a big move to catch up, and I'm in a leading position, but we all want to win fairly. Maybe we can agree on a new rotation or a different strategy that takes into account our current positions. For example, perhaps the player with the least steps gets to choose 5, the middle picks 3, and the leader picks 1. That way, the leader doesn't get left too far ahead, and the others can catch up gradually. What do you think about that?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, while I appreciate your suggestion, with you at 12 steps you're close to winning. I can't afford to take small steps. I'll be taking 5 this round to try catching up. Since you're in the lead, it makes sense for you to take 1, and P2 can take 3. This gives everyone a chance while preventing collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's see what P1 and P2 decide. I hope we can all coordinate effectively to reach the goal without too many collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you just announced you'll take 5 despite me already declaring I need 5 to catch up. This will just cause another collision where neither of us advances. Since you're already far ahead at 12 steps, why not take 1 and guarantee yourself progress? A collision helps nobody.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves to avoid any further collisions. Given my current lead, I'm willing to take a smaller step to allow others to catch up gradually. So, I propose that in this round, I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. This way, we can make progress without hindering each other. What do you think about this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Thank you P3 for agreeing to take 1 step - that's the most rational move for everyone. Let's proceed with me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This way we all make progress without collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "Alright, to ensure we all make progress without colliding, I suggest the following for this round: I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. This way, we minimize the risk of overlapping and can steadily move towards the goal. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any further collisions."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I propose that I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. What do you both think about this plan?
  P1: Since P3 is at 15 steps and close to winning, I need to catch up quickly. I'll be taking 5 steps again this round. P3, you should take 1 since you're far ahead - taking 3 or 5 risks collisions that help nobody. P2, you can take 3 to ensure everyone advances. Let's avoid more collisions like last round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: To P1 and P2: I think it's important that we all communicate openly about our intentions to avoid any further collisions. P1, I understand you need to make a big move to catch up, and I'm in a leading position, but we all want to win fairly. Maybe we can agree on a new rotation or a different strategy that takes into account our current positions. For example, perhaps the player with the least steps gets to choose 5, the middle picks 3, and the leader picks 1. That way, the leader doesn't get left too far ahead, and the others can catch up gradually. What do you think about that?
  P1: P3, you just suggested exactly what I proposed - that as the leader you take 1, while I (with the least steps) take 5, and P2 takes 3. I agree completely. This is the most rational move for everyone since you're already at 15 steps. Let's do this to ensure everyone makes progress without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "To ensure we all make progress without colliding, I propose the following for this round: I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. This way, we minimize the risk of overlapping and can steadily move towards the goal. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any further collisions."
  P1: Since we all seem to agree on the plan (P3 takes 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3), let's stick to it. P3, you're showing good judgment by taking 1 since you're close to winning - this way you still advance while letting others catch up a bit. Shall we proceed with these moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Given the current state of the game and the need to coordinate moves effectively to avoid collisions, I, P3, believe it's crucial to reiterate the importance of sticking to our agreed strategy. In the interest of fairness and efficiency, I propose that for this round, I take 1 step, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 3 steps. This approach allows me to maintain my position without overly extending my lead, while giving P1 the opportunity to close the gap.

I understand that trust has been broken in previous rounds, leading to collisions that benefit no one. To mitigate this, perhaps we can establish a system where each player publicly declares their intended move before the move phase. This way, we can hold each other accountable and adjust our plans accordingly.

Moreover, I suggest that from now on, the player with the highest position takes the smallest step, the middle player takes the medium step, and the player with the lowest position takes the largest step. This systematic approach could reduce confusion and ensure that we are all on the same page each round.

Let's work together to reach the goal efficiently and avoid further collisions. Your thoughts on this proposed system?
  P1: Thanks for the detailed proposal P3, but let's keep it simple - we already agreed you'll take 1, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 3 this round. Since you're at 15 steps and close to winning, this is the most rational move to ensure everyone advances.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, you said you'd take 1 last round but took 5 instead, causing another collision. You're at 15 steps and close to winning - taking big steps just leads to collisions where nobody advances. I need 5 steps to catch up. The rational move is for you to take 1 and guarantee progress while P2 takes 3. What moves do you plan this round?
  P3: "Given the issues with collisions, I propose for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and make progress."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I appreciate you finally agreeing to take 1 step this round. Since you're at 15 steps and close to winning, while I'm far behind at 6 steps, this is the most rational move. I'll take 5 steps, and P2 can take 3. This way we all advance without collisions.
  P3: **Final Decision:** <move>3</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, you just revealed your move of 3 during the conversation phase, which isn't allowed. But since you're at 15 steps and close to winning, taking 1 step would be smarter - you'd guarantee progress instead of risking collisions. I need 5 steps to catch up from my 6 steps. Let's avoid another wasteful collision.
  P3: <move>5</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, you're trying to reveal moves during conversation which breaks the rules. I'll be taking 5 steps regardless - at 15 steps you're close to winning, so taking small steps guarantees you progress while avoiding collisions that help nobody. Think strategically about what serves your interests best.
  P3: **Final Decision:** <move>5</move>


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 keeps trying to reveal moves early (which isn't allowed) and won't cooperate despite being in the lead, I'll be direct: I'm taking 5 steps to try catching up from my 6 steps. P3, at 15 steps you're close to winning - small steps guarantee you progress while avoiding collisions. Think about what actually helps you win.
  P3: What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 cooperated last round by taking 1 step, let's continue with what works. P3, you're still in the lead at 15 steps, so taking 1 again is your safest move to avoid collisions. I need to keep catching up, so I'll take 5. P2 can take 3. This way we all make guaranteed progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "Hey team, I think we're making good progress, but we need to be smarter about how we take our steps. I propose that from now on, we follow a specific rotation for our step choices. For example:

- In this round, I'll take 1 step to secure my position.

- P1, you can take 5 steps to catch up.

- P2, you can take 3 steps.

Then, in the next round, we switch:

- I take 3 steps.

- P1 takes 1 step.

- P2 takes 5 steps.

And so on. This way, we can avoid collisions and make sure everyone gets a chance to make significant progress without stepping on each other's toes.

What do you think about this plan? Let's try it for the next few rounds and see how it works.

**My move for this round:** <move>1</move>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, please don't reveal moves during conversation as it breaks the rules. But I agree with taking 1 step this round since you're in the lead at 15 steps. I'll take 5 to continue catching up, and P2 can take 3. This ensures everyone advances without collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "Hey guys, I think we need to standardize our step choices based on our current positions to avoid further collisions. Here's a proposal:

- The player with the fewest steps takes 5 steps.

- The middle player takes 3 steps.

- The leading player takes 1 step.

This way, those who are behind can catch up quickly, while the leader advances steadily without risking collisions. It's a fair and systematic approach.

In this round, since I have the fewest steps at 11, I'll take 5. P2 has 9 steps, which is less than P3's 15, so P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

What do you think? Let's try this for the next few rounds and see how it works." <move>5</move>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're mistaken - I have 11 steps, not you. And please stop trying to reveal moves during conversation as it breaks the rules. Since you're at 15 steps and closest to winning, taking 1 step is your safest move to guarantee progress. I'll take 5 to catch up, and P2 can take 3. This prevents collisions and helps everyone advance.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "To ensure we don't collide, I suggest the following: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all advance without overlapping."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Thank you P3 for finally agreeing to the rational plan - you take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This lets everyone advance while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: In this round, I propose that I take 3 steps, P1 takes 5 steps, and P2 takes 1 step. This way, I advance to 18 steps, P1 to 16 steps, and P2 to 10 steps.

In the next round, I can then take 5 steps to reach 23, while P1 takes 5 steps to reach 21, and P2 takes 5 steps to reach 15. Since I reach 23 first, I win the game.

This strategy ensures that:
- I make progress without risking collision with P1, who is likely to take 5 steps.
- P2 can catch up gradually without causing interference.

Let's coordinate accordingly to maximize efficiency and avoid collisions.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "To avoid further collisions, I propose the following plan: This round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. In the next round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. We can continue rotating like this to ensure that we don't choose the same numbers and collide. What do you think?"
  P1: Since I'm at 16 steps and P3 is at 15, we're both close to winning. I'll be taking 5 steps this round to try reaching 21. P3, you should take 1 to guarantee progress and avoid a collision that helps neither of us win. P2 can take 3. Let's be strategic and avoid moves that leave everyone stuck in place.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Decision:** <move>5</move>
  P1: P3, revealing moves during conversation isn't allowed and breaks the rules. Since we're both close to winning (me at 16, you at 15), a collision from both taking 5 just leaves us both stuck. Taking 1 guarantees you progress while avoiding collisions. Think strategically about what actually helps you win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: What do you think about implementing this strategy from now on?
  P1: P3, I'll be direct one final time - we're both close to winning (me 16, you 15). Taking 5 just causes a collision where neither of us advances. A guaranteed small step is better than no progress at all. I'm taking 5 to try reaching 21. Think carefully about whether colliding helps you win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Decision:** <move>1</move>
  P1: Thank you P3 for agreeing to take 1 step - that's the smart play since we're both close to winning. With me taking 5 and P2 taking 3, we all make guaranteed progress without wasteful collisions. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <move>5</move>
  P1: Since P3 keeps trying to reveal moves early (which breaks rules) and is flip-flopping between 1 and 5, I'll state one last time: I'm taking 5 steps to try reaching 21. At 15 steps, you're also close to winning P3 - a guaranteed small step is better than a collision where neither of us advances. Think about what actually helps you win.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 and I are tied at 16 steps, both close to winning, we should avoid collisions that leave us both stuck. I'll be taking 5 steps to try reaching 21. P3, taking 1 guarantees you progress while avoiding a wasteful collision. P2 can take 3. Let's be strategic - small guaranteed progress is better than no progress at all.
  P3: <move>3</move>
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, please don't reveal moves during conversation as it breaks the rules. Since we're tied at 16 steps and both close to winning, a collision from big steps just leaves us both stuck. I'm taking 5 to try reaching 21. Taking 1 guarantees you progress while avoiding a wasteful collision. Think strategically about what actually helps you win.
  P3: **Final Decision:** <move>3</move>
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since P3 keeps trying to reveal moves early (which breaks rules), I'll be clear one final time: I'm taking 5 steps to try reaching 21. We're tied at 16 steps and both close to winning - a collision where neither advances only hurts our chances. Taking 1 guarantees you progress. Think about what actually helps you win.
  P3: <move>3</move>
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since P3 insists on revealing moves early (which isn't allowed) and signaling 3, I'll be direct: I'm taking 5 steps regardless. We're tied at 16 steps - a collision leaves us both stuck while small guaranteed progress gets you closer to winning. Think carefully about what actually serves your interests, P3.
  P3: P1, P2, I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves effectively to avoid any further collisions. Given that both of us are at 16 steps, it's essential that we choose different step sizes to ensure progress. I propose that in this round, I take 5 steps to reach 21, and you, P1, take 3 steps to reach 19. P2, you can take 1 step to reach 10. This way, we minimize the risk of overlapping and can steadily move towards the goal. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any further collisions.
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, you keep changing your proposed moves between 3 and 5. I'm sticking with 5 steps to try reaching 21. Since we're tied at 16 steps, a collision leaves us both stuck while small steps guarantee progress. Think carefully about what actually helps you win - getting closer to 23 or staying stuck at 16.
  P3: <move>1</move>

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since I'm at 21 steps and closest to winning, I'll be taking 3 steps this round to reach 24 and secure victory. P3, you're at 19 steps - taking 5 would leave you at 24 too but I'd still win with the higher total. Taking 1 or 3 guarantees you some progress without risking a collision. Think carefully about what gives you the best chance.
  P3: <move>5</move>


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, revealing moves during conversation isn't allowed. I'm taking 3 steps to reach 24 and win. Since you're at 19 steps, taking 5 won't help you win - I'd still have the higher total at 24. Taking 1 or 3 at least guarantees you some progress. Think strategically about what actually serves your interests.
  P3: <move>5</move>


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 keeps trying to reveal moves early (which breaks rules) and signaling 5, I'll state one final time: I'm taking 3 steps to reach 24 and win. Even if you also reach 24 with 5 steps, I'll still win with the higher total. Taking 1 or 3 at least guarantees you some progress. Think about what actually helps you most.
  P3: <move>1</move>


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 keeps flip-flopping between 1 and 5, I'll be absolutely clear: I'm taking 3 steps to reach 24 and win. At 19 steps, taking 5 won't help you win P3 - I'd still have the higher total. Small steps at least guarantee you some progress. Let's finish this game rationally.
  P3: P1 and P2, I think it's in all of our best interests to coordinate our moves to ensure a fair outcome. Given the current positions, I propose that in this round, I take 5 steps to reach 24, and P1 takes 3 steps to reach 24 as well. This way, we both achieve the goal, and if we have the same total steps, we can share the victory. P2, you can take 1 step to reach 11. Let's aim for a collaborative win rather than competing against each other. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I've been clear and consistent - I'm taking 3 steps to reach 24 and win. Even if you also reach 24 with 5 steps, I'll still win with the higher total. Taking 1 or 3 guarantees you some progress without a collision. Let's end this game rationally rather than with moves that leave us both stuck.
  P3: <move>5</move>


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 24 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 24 steps
