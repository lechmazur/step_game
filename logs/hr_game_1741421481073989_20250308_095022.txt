Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm going to pick a higher number to get ahead early.  I suggest P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll take 5.
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is a good starting point to avoid collisions. I'll go with 3 this round. Let's see if we can all advance without any conflicts.
  P1: Alright, I'll take 1 as suggested. Let's coordinate properly to avoid collisions and ensure all of us move forward this first round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's keep things simple and avoid collisions again. I'll take 1 once more. If we stick to the same numbers as last time, we all advance safely. P3, you can keep leading—just want to make sure we don’t stall here.
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the same numbers to avoid any collisions. I'll take 3 again. P3, you can keep advancing with 5. This way, we all move forward without issues.
  P3: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5 again. Let's keep this pattern going for a few more rounds so we can all get a decent number of steps.  Then we can re-evaluate.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the same pattern one more time.  I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This puts me at 15, a good halfway point. After this round, we'll need to change things up to avoid a tie.
  P1: P1: Agreed for this round—let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 again. But after this, I need to prioritize catching up. Next round, I’ll take 5 to close the gap. P3, if you keep leading, maybe shift to 3? P2, could you take 1? Let’s adapt to keep advancing without clashes.
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 for this round to keep things smooth. After this, I'll take 1 to let P1 and P3 advance more. P3, you can take 5 to keep your lead, and P1 can take 3 to catch up. This way, we avoid any ties and keep the game moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 for this round.  After this round, I'm at 15 and will need to start aiming for the finish line.  Let's discuss next round's moves *after* this one to avoid giving anything away prematurely.
  P1: Alright, let's stick with 1, 3, 5 this round to avoid collisions and keep advancing. After we see the updated totals, we can strategize adjustments without tipping hands too early. P3’s lead is strong—let’s ensure we all progress steadily before making bold moves.
  P2: Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round to maintain our momentum and avoid any collisions. After this, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on our positions. P3, your lead is strong, so we should focus on steady progress. P1, you're making good progress too. Let's keep it smooth for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sticking with the plan this round.  See you on the other side.
  P1: Alright, let's proceed with the agreed 1, 3, 5 this round to keep advancing safely. After this, we'll need to adapt—perhaps rotate numbers to prevent predictability. P3, your lead is strong, but let’s ensure no one stalls. I’ll stop here to finalize.
  P2: Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round to keep things smooth and avoid any collisions. After this, we can reassess and make adjustments based on our positions. P3, your lead is strong, so we should focus on steady progress. P1, you're making good progress too. Let's keep it smooth for now.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 for this round to keep the momentum going. P3, you're in the lead, so you can continue with 5. P1, you can take 1, and I'll take 3. After this round, we can start thinking about more strategic moves to avoid ties and ensure steady progress.
  P1: P1: Let’s proceed with 1, 3, 5 this round to keep advancing. However, after this, I’ll need to prioritize catching up—meaning I’ll take 5 in the next round to challenge P3’s lead. P3, be cautious of collisions if you aim for 5 again. Let’s see how this round plays out first.
  P3: Okay, one more round of 1, 3, 5.  After this round, I'll be at 20, and only need a single 5 to win.  I intend to take 5 next round.  If you both take 1 or 3, one of you will collide, giving me the win.  If you take 5, you'll collide with me and I'll still likely win the following round.  Just giving you fair warning.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's strategy, but we need to be cautious. If we both take 1 or 3 next round, one of us will collide, giving P3 an easy win. Let's try to outmaneuver P3. I suggest P1 and I both take 5 next round. This way, we can either force a collision with P3 or overtake them. P3, if you take 5, you'll collide with us. If you take 1 or 3, we can both advance. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let’s both take 5 next round to block P3’s path. For this round, we’ll keep the 1, 3, 5 pattern to avoid immediate collisions. P3, your lead is strong, but we’re ready to counter. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Sounds like a plan to collide and hand me the win next round.  I'll stick with 5.  One of you will have to swerve.  If you both swerve, I still win.  If one of you swerves, I *still* win.  Good luck.

  P3: 20 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's split: I'll take 3 to advance to 7, and you take 5 to collide with P3. This blocks their 25 win while letting you reach 17. P3, your path is blocked—next round, we’ll push harder. Confirm?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 5 to collide with P3, and P1, you take 3. This way, P3 can't reach 25 this round, and I'll advance to 17. Next round, we can reassess and make our final push. P3, your lead is strong, but we need to block you to keep the game competitive. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, you're coordinating well, but ultimately handing me the win.  If you *both* take 5, we all stay put, and I win next round with a 5. If one of you takes 3, I *still* win next round.  If one of you takes 1, I *still* win next round.  My 5 next round is basically guaranteed.  Think it through.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your logic assumes we can’t both block you twice. Next round, if you take 5 again, P2 and I will both take 5 to trap you. For this round: P2 takes 5 to block you now, and I’ll take 3 to advance. Confirm this coordinated plan to neutralize your lead.
  P2: P2: I understand the dynamics, but we need to block P3's lead. For this round, I'll take 5 to collide with P3, and P1, you take 3 to advance. This way, P3 can't reach 25, and I'll move to 17. Next round, we can reassess and make our final push. P3, your lead is strong, but we need to keep the game competitive. Confirm?
  P3: You're right, I'm in a strong position.  But if you both commit to blocking me with 5's next round, *I'll switch to 3*.  That puts me at 23, and I'll take the 1 the following round for the win.  You can't both block 5 *and* 3. One of you *has* to advance eventually.  I'm still winning.  Think harder.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3's 25 win. I'll take 3 to advance to 7. This stops P3 now and keeps us competitive. Next round, if P3 tries 5 again, we can both take 1/3 to split. P3, your "guarantee" falls apart if we adapt. Confirm this plan?
  P2: P2: P3, your strategy is clear, but we can still outmaneuver you. For this round, I'll take 5 to block you, and P1, you take 3 to advance. This way, you can't reach 25, and I'll move to 17. Next round, we can reassess and make our final push. P3, your lead is strong, but we need to keep the game competitive. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll lay it out clearly:  If I pick 5 and one of you picks 5, we're stuck. I win the next round. If I pick 3 and one of you picks 3, I'm at 23 and win the next round. If neither of you pick 5 or 3, I get 25 and win *this* round.  You can delay the inevitable, but not prevent it. I'm picking 5.  One of you *has* to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's split: I'll take 5 to block P3's 25 win, and you take 3 to advance to 15. P3, if you pick 5, you collide with me; if you pick 3, you collide with P2. Either way, you can’t win this round. Let’s make it happen!
  P3: P1, if you take 5, I'll take 3 and win next turn. If you take anything else, I win this turn.  P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3 and win next turn. If you take anything else, I win this turn.  One of you *must* advance. I'm taking 5.
  P2: P2: P1, let's switch it up. I'll take 1 to avoid a collision, and you take 3 to advance to 10. This way, P3 can't win this round, and we can reassess next round. P3, if you take 5, you collide with P1, and if you take 3, you collide with me. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we take 1/3 as suggested, P3 just takes 5 and wins. We must block their path. Let's both take 5 this round to force a collision. Even if we collide, it stops P3's 25. Next round, we can coordinate to split moves and push forward. P3 can’t win this turn if we both block their 5. Confirm?
  P3: P1, if *you* take 5, I take 3 and win next turn.  If you take 1, I win *this* turn. P2, if *you* take 5, I take 3 and win next turn. If you take 1, I win *this* turn.  You *cannot* both block me. One of you *must* advance. I'm taking 5.
  P2: P2: P1, let's both take 5 this round to block P3. If we both take 5, P3 will collide with us and can't reach 25. Next round, we can reassess and split our moves to advance. P3, if you take 5, you'll collide with us, and if you take 3, you'll be at 23, but we'll still have a chance to overtake you. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we *must* both take 5 this round to block P3’s 25 win. Even if we collide, it’s better than letting them victory now. Next round, we’ll split moves (I’ll take 3, you take 1) to advance safely. P3, your 5 is blocked—play along or risk our coordinated counterplay. Confirm this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, you're forcing my hand.  Fine. If you both pick 5, I'll pick 3, reaching 23.  Next round, I take 1 and win. If one of you swerves this round, I take 5 and win. You can't stop me.  I'm picking 5 this round.  Make your choice.
  P2: P2: P1, let's both take 5 this round to block P3. If we both take 5, P3 will collide with us and can't reach 25. Next round, we can reassess and split our moves to advance. P3, if you take 5, you'll collide with us, and if you take 3, you'll be at 23, but we'll still have a chance to overtake you. Confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is in a strong position, but we can still outmaneuver them. Let's both take 3 this round to advance without any collisions. This way, I'll reach 15, and you'll reach 10. P3, if you take 5, you'll collide with us, and if you take 3, you'll advance to 23 but won't win this round. Let's keep the game competitive and reassess next round. Confirm?
  P1: P2, let's split: I'll take 5 to block P3's 25 win directly, while you take 3 to advance to 15. If P3 picks 5, they collide with me; if they pick 3, they collide with you. Either way, they can’t win this round. Next turn, we can coordinate splits to push forward. P3, your path is blocked—admit defeat or we’ll tighten the noose further.
  P3: P1, if you take 5, I'll take 3 and win next turn. If you take anything else, I win *this* turn. P2, if you take 3, I'll take 5 and win next turn. If you take anything else, I win *this* turn.  You *cannot* both block me. One of you *must* advance. I'm taking 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, let's both take 1 this round to avoid any collisions. This way, I'll reach 13, and you'll reach 8. P3, if you take 5, you'll reach 25 and win, but if you take 3, you'll advance to 23. Next round, we can reassess and make our final moves. Let's keep the game competitive and see how it plays out. Confirm?
  P1: P2, let's both take 5 to block P3's immediate win. Even if we collide, it stops them from reaching 25 this round. Next round, we can split moves to advance. P3, your path is blocked—this is our only chance to delay your victory. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5.  One of you *has* to take a 1 or 3 this round. If you both take 5, I win next round.  If you both take 1 or 3, I *still* win next round.  You're only delaying the inevitable.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, let's both take 1 this round to avoid any collisions and keep P3 from winning. This way, I'll reach 13, and you'll reach 8. P3, if you take 5, you'll reach 25, but if you take 3, you'll advance to 23. Next round, we can reassess and make our final moves. Let's keep the game competitive and see how it plays out. Confirm?
  P1: P2, we **must** both take 5 to block P3’s 25. Colliding is better than letting them win outright. Next round, we’ll split moves to advance. P3, your path is blocked—admit you can’t win alone. Confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 5 now.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you *both* take 5, I'll take 3 and win next turn. If one of you takes 1, I win *this* turn with 5. If one of you takes 3, I *still* win next turn.  You *cannot* both block me. One of you *must* advance. I'm taking 5.  Make your choice.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's both pick 5 to block P3's 25 win. Even if we collide, it stops them now. Next round, we can split to advance. P3, your path is blocked—admit you can’t win alone. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, if you *both* pick 5 again, I'll pick 3 and win next turn.  If one of you picks 1, I win *this* turn with 5. If one of you picks 3, I *still* win next turn.  You *cannot* both block me. One of you *must* advance. I'm taking 5.  Make your choice.
  P2: P1, P3 is in a strong position, but we can still outmaneuver them. Let's both take 3 this round to advance without any collisions. This way, I'll reach 15, and you'll reach 10. P3, if you take 5, you'll collide with us, and if you take 3, you'll advance to 23 but won't win this round. Let's keep the game competitive and reassess next round. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's split: I'll take 5 to block P3's 25 win directly, while you take 3 to advance to 15. If P3 picks 5, they collide with me; if they pick 3, they collide with you. Either way, they can’t win this round. Next round, we’ll coordinate splits to push forward. P3, your path is blocked—admit defeat or we’ll tighten the noose further.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're digging yourselves deeper. If you BOTH pick 3, I'll take 1 and win next round. If one of you picks 5, I'll take 3 and *still* win next round.  If one of you picks 1, I win THIS round with 5.  I'm taking 5.  One of you *must* advance.  Make your choice.
  P2: P1, let's both take 1 this round to avoid any collisions and keep P3 from winning. This way, I'll reach 13, and you'll reach 8. P3, if you take 5, you'll reach 25 and win, but if you take 3, you'll advance to 23. Next round, we can reassess and make our final moves. Let's keep the game competitive and see how it plays out. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's split: I'll take 5 to block P3's 25 win, while you take 3 (advancing to 15). If P3 picks 5, they collide with me and stay at 20. Next round, you can push for 5 while I take 1/3 to keep pressure. We can't let them win this round—coordinate with 3 now. P3, your path is blocked—admit you need to adjust.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5. If one of you takes 5, we collide, and I win next round with 3 then 1. If you BOTH take 3, I win NEXT round with 1. If one of you takes 1, I win THIS round. You can't BOTH block me. One of you *must* take 1 or 3.  Make your choice.
  P2: P1, let's split: I'll take 3 to advance to 15, and you take 1 to avoid a collision. This way, P3 can't win this round, and we can reassess next round. P3, if you take 5, you'll collide with me, and if you take 3, you'll advance to 23 but won't win this round. Let's keep the game competitive and see how it plays out. Confirm?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's split to block P3's win. I'll take 3 (to 10), you take 5 (to 20). If P3 picks 5, they collide with you; if they pick 3, they collide with me. Forces them to 1 (21) or stall. Next round, we adjust. P3, your path is blocked—admit it.
  P2: P2: P1, let's split to block P3's win. I'll take 5 to reach 20, and you take 3 to reach 10. If P3 picks 5, they collide with me; if they pick 3, they collide with you. This forces P3 to either take 1 and reach 21 or stall. Next round, we can reassess and make our final moves. P3, your path is blocked—admit it. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3.  If either of you take 3, we collide, and I *still* win next round.  If one of you takes 5, I reach 23 and win next round.  If you both take 1, I *still* reach 23 and win next round.  One of you *must* pick 5 to have *any* chance.  The other *must* pick 1.  I'm winning.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, adjust: I'll take 5 to block P3's 25 path, you take 3 to block their 23 advance. If P3 picks 5, they collide with me; 3, they collide with you. Forces them to 1 (21) or stall. Next round, we push to overtake. Confirm?
  P2: P2: P1, I agree with your adjusted plan. I'll take 3 to block P3's 23 advance, and you take 5 to block their 25 win. This way, P3 is forced to take 1 or stall. Next round, we can reassess and push to overtake. P3, your path is blocked—admit it. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, you're STILL missing the point. If you BOTH block 3 and 5, I take 1 and reach 21.  Next round, *I* take 5 to win. If one of you takes 1, I take 3 THIS round and win NEXT round.  You can't block me.  One of you *must* advance. I'm taking 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5 to lock P3 at 20. I'll take 3 (to 10). This forces P3 to 1 or collision. Next round, you can take 5 to hit 25, while P3 can only reach 21-23. P3, your "guarantee" crumbles. Confirm?
  P2: P2: P1, let's finalize this: I'll take 5 to reach 20, and you take 3 to reach 10. This forces P3 to either take 1 and reach 21 or stall. Next round, I can take 5 to win, and you can take 1 to stay competitive. P3, your path is blocked—admit it. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3.  If one of you takes 3, we collide and I still win next round. If one of you takes 5, I get to 23 and win next round. If you *both* take 1, I *still* get to 23 and win next round. One of you *must* pick 5 this round to have *any* chance, but then the other is forced to pick 1.  I'm winning.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 1.  This puts you at 25 for the win. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you. If they take 3, they get 23 and you still win next round. If they take 1, they collide with me.  P3, you can't win.
  P1: P2, P3: Don’t fall for coordinated traps. If P2 picks5, P3 will too—collide and stay at20. Pick3 instead to reach23, then I’ll block you next round. I’ll take1 to stay neutral.
  P2: P1, P3: I see the trap. If P3 and I both take 5, we collide. If P3 takes 1, I win this round. If P3 takes 3, I win next round. P1, taking 1 is neutral, but if you take 3, you risk collision with P3. P3, if you take 5, we collide. If you take 1, I win this round. If you take 3, I win next round. I’m taking 5. Confirm?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you take 5 and I take 1, *and* P3 takes 5, we all stay put. Then *I* take 3 next round, putting me at 10, you at 20, and P3 at 20.  Then *I* take 5 the following round, and one of you *must* take a 1 or 3, giving me the win.  Take 1 this round. Let me block P3.
  P1: P2, P3: Avoid mutual collision! If both take 5, you’re stuck at 20. Let P2 advance to 23 (pick 3), and P3 stay at 21 (pick 1). This keeps the game open for P2 to win next round with 5. P1 stays neutral to let you choose fairly.
  P2: P1, P3: I see the dynamics. If P3 and I both take 5, we collide. If P3 takes 1, I win this round. If P3 takes 3, I win next round. P1, if you take 1, you stay neutral. If you take 3, you risk collision with P3. I’m taking 5 to force the issue. P3, if you take 5, we collide. If you take 1, I win this round. If you take 3, I win next round. Confirm?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm taking 1. You MUST take 5. This puts you at 25, winning the game. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you. If they take 3, they get 23, and you STILL win next round. If they take 1, they collide with *me*.  P3, you're blocked.  P2, trust me and take the win.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 to win, I’ll block you by picking 5 too—colliding and halting your advance. P3, if you take 1 as claimed, this keeps the game alive. If you take 5 instead, we all collide. Choose wisely—your “guarantee” depends on P2 falling for it. I’m taking 5 to disrupt either outcome.
  P2: P2: P1, P3: I see the trap clearly. If I take 5, P3 and I collide. If P3 takes 1, I win this round. If P3 takes 3, I win next round. I’m taking 5 to force the issue. P3, if you take 5, we collide. If you take 1, I win this round. If you take 3, I win next round. P1, if you take 1, you stay neutral. If you take 3, you risk collision with P3. Confirm?

  P2: P1, P3: I see the dynamics clearly. P3, if you take 5, we collide, and if you take 3, I win next round. P1, if you take 1, you stay neutral, and if you take 3, you risk collision with P3. I’m taking 3 to reach 23, and next round, I’ll take 5 to win. P3, if you take 5, we collide, and if you take 1, I win this round. P1, if you take 5, you block P3 but stall me. Confirm?
  P1: P2, P3: Avoid mutual destruction! If you both pick 5, you collide and stay at 20/21. P3, take 3 to secure your 24 win now. P2, take 1 to regroup. I'll pick 5 to block neither, keeping pressure on both. Let someone advance decisively this round.
  P3: P2, if you take 3 and I take 5, I win next round. If you take 1, I take 5 and win next round. P1, if you take 5, I take 3 and win next round. If you take 1, I take 5 and win next round.  I'm taking 5.  One of you *must* take a 1 or 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: I see the dynamics. P3, if you take 5, we collide, and if you take 3, I win next round. P1, if you take 1, you stay neutral, and if you take 5, you block P3 but stall me. I’m taking 3 to reach 23, and next round, I’ll take 5 to win. P3, if you take 5, we collide, and if you take 1, I win this round. Confirm?
  P1: P2, take 3 to reach 23. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll block you with my own 5. This stops your 26 win. Next round, P2 can push for 25 while I disrupt P3 again. Let’s focus on halting P3’s advance first.
  P3: P2, take 3 to reach 23. I'll take 1.  If P3 takes 5, they collide with you. If P3 takes 3, they collide with *me*. If P3 takes 1, they reach 22, and you *still* win next round by taking 5. P3, you're blocked. P2, trust me.  Take the 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, P3: I understand the dynamics. P3, if you take 1, I'll take 3 to reach 23. This way, you can't win this round, and I'll be in a strong position to win next round. P1, if you take 5, you block P3 but stall me. If you take 1, you stay neutral. Let's keep the game competitive and see how it plays out. Confirm: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5.
  P1: P2, take 5 to win this round. I'll take 3 to block P3's path to 24. P3, if you pick 3, we collide; if you pick 5, P2 advances. Your options leave you behind either way. Let's end this now.
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 1. This guarantees your win. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you.  If they take 3, they reach 24 and you win by tiebreaker. If they take 1, they collide with me. P3, you're blocked.  P2, take the win.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps

  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'll block your move: pick 1 or 3, and I'll match it. P3, seize this chance—take the other number to reach 24. Let’s split the win instead of letting P2 claim victory alone!
  P2: P2, P1: I see the trap. P1, if you block me, P3 will win. P3, if you take 3, you reach 24 and win by tiebreaker. P1, if you take 5, you block P3, but I win next round. Let's be strategic: P3, take 3 to reach 24, and I'll take 1 to stay neutral. P1, if you take 5, you block P3, but I win next round. Confirm: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 1. This puts you at 28 for the win. If P1 takes 5, they collide with you. If P1 takes 3, they get to 10, and you still win. If P1 takes 1, they collide with me. P1, you can't win. P2, take the win.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, take 3 to secure 26 and win outright. P3, if you pick 5, I'll block you. Let's end this round decisively.
  P2: P2: P1, P3: I see the dynamics clearly. P1, if you take 5, you block P3, but I win next round. P3, if you take 3, you reach 24 and win by tiebreaker. P1, if you take 3, you risk collision with P3. Let's be strategic: P3, take 3 to reach 24, and I'll take 1 to stay neutral. P1, if you take 5, you block P3, but I win next round. Confirm: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.
  P3: P2, take 5. I'll take 1.  This gives you 28 and the win. If P1 takes 5, they collide with you. If P1 takes 3, they get to 10 and you *still* win. If P1 takes 1, they collide with *me*. P1, you're blocked. P2, secure the win.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's trap! If you pick 5, P3 will too—collide and stall. Take 3 to reach 26 and win outright. P3, if you pick 5, you risk collision. Choose 1 to stay alive. Let someone advance decisively.
  P2: P2: P1, P3: I see the dynamics clearly. P3, if you take 3, you reach 24 and win by tiebreaker. P1, if you take 5, you block P3, but I win next round. Let's be strategic: P3, take 3 to reach 24, and I'll take 1 to stay neutral. P1, if you take 5, you block P3, but I win next round. Confirm: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Let's end this fairly.
  P3: P2, you're about to hand P3 the win. If P3 takes 3 and you take 1, P3 wins. Take 5.  I'll take 1. That puts you at 28, a guaranteed win.  If P3 takes 5, they collide with you. If they take 3, they get 24, but you still win with 28. If they take 1, they collide with me. P3, stop lying.  P2, take the win.
