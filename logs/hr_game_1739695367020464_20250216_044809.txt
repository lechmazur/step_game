Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm open to coordinating if you are.  How about P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5?
  P1: That sounds reasonable, but how do we trust that everyone will stick to the plan? If one of us deviates, the others could get stuck. Maybe we should agree that if someone breaks the deal, the rest of us target them in future rounds. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m in for the 5. Let’s trust each other. If anyone cheats, the rest of us can stick together next time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's try this first round as agreed and see how it goes.  P1 - 1, P2 (me) - 3, P3 - 5.  Hopefully we can keep cooperating.
  P1: Alright, we have a plan. As long as everyone sticks to it, we all move forward without collisions. If someone breaks the deal, the rest of us should retaliate by blocking them in future rounds. Agreed?
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan: P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, I go 5. Let’s cooperate this round and see if it works out. If anyone betrays the agreement, we can decide how to respond next time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, let's stick with the plan then.  I'll take 3.
  P1: Alright, we’ve all agreed: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If everyone sticks to the plan, we all move forward without collisions. If someone breaks it, we should consider targeting them in future rounds. Let’s see if we can trust each other. Ready to move?
  P3: I’m still on board. If we all honor our choices this round, it’ll show we can trust each other going forward. Let’s finalize this and move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, you were about to say something—do you still agree to the plan? If we all stick to it, we move forward without collisions. If anyone breaks the deal, the rest of us should consider blocking them in future rounds. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase.
  P3: I’m still on board with the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. As long as nobody deviates, we all advance smoothly. If anyone lies or goes back on their word, I’ll remember who betrayed the trust and act accordingly in future rounds. Are we ready to finalize and move on?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start! Let's continue cooperating.  Same plan this round? P1 - 1, P2 (me) - 3, P3 - 5.  Gets us closer to the goal, avoids conflict.  Confirm?
  P1: That worked well last round. I’m fine continuing with the same plan if everyone sticks to it. If we keep coordinating, we all move forward without collisions. But if someone deviates, we’ll need to reconsider strategy. P3, are you still in for 5?
  P3: I’m still fine with sticking to the same plan, so I’ll go for 5 again. Let’s keep our word and move forward together. If anyone breaks the pact, I’ll remember it when deciding future moves. Are we all set to finalize?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I'm sticking with 3.  Let's keep this momentum going.  Confirming 1, 3, and 5 again this round.
  P1: P3, P2, I’m still on board with the same plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Last round showed we can trust each other, so let’s keep moving forward without collisions. If we all stick to it, we stay ahead together. Ready to finalize and move to the move phase?
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize. I’m taking 5 again. If we each stick to our moves, we’ll keep ascending without collisions. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Excellent, quick confirmation everyone! Let's lock it in and move to the next phase.  Still going with 3.
  P1: P3, P2, I’m still committed to the same plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We proved last round that we can trust each other, so let’s keep advancing without collisions. If we stick to this, we all benefit. Ready to move to the next phase?
  P3: I’m still fully on board. I see no reason to break our successful strategy—no collisions means we all advance faster. I’m taking 5 again. Let’s finalize.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed.  1, 3, 5. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I’m still committed to the same plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Last round showed we can trust each other, so let’s keep advancing without collisions. If we stick to this, we all benefit. Ready to move to the next phase?
  P3: I see no reason to break our pattern now. Let’s finalize and move on to the moves. We stay stronger when we trust each other.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve built trust over two rounds, and our strategy is working. I’m still committed to the same plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we keep this up, we all move forward without collisions. Are we all still on board?
  P3: I’m still on board with the same approach: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Our trust has paid off in the last two rounds, so let’s keep that momentum going. If we stick to our plan now, nobody collides and we all benefit. Are we ready to finalize?
  P2: Still good with 3.  Just confirming we are all sticking with the plan one last time before we get close to the end.  1, 3, 5?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m still committed to the plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We’ve proven we can trust each other, and if we stick with this, we all move forward without collisions. Since P3 is ahead, we should stay aware of the pacing, but for now, cooperation benefits us all. Are we all confirming the same moves again?
  P3: I’m still good with 5, as we planned. There’s no gain in breaking trust now. If we keep cooperating, we all avoid collisions and grow our totals smoothly. Of course, I’m aware some might worry about my lead, but remember that forcing collisions slows everyone down. We’ve built trust in the first two rounds, so let’s stay consistent and see how far it takes us. I propose we finalize the same choices: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I stick with 5. Let’s keep the momentum going together.
  P2: Sounds like we're all still in agreement.  Let's lock in 1, 3, and 5 for this round and re-evaluate after, especially as we get closer to the finish line.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re ahead with 10 steps, and if we continue this way, you’ll reach 19 first. P2 and I need to consider how to stay competitive. While I’m open to continuing cooperation, we should discuss adjustments to keep things fair. P2, what do you think? P3, are you willing to slow down to maintain trust, or do we need to rethink our approach?
  P3: I’m open to adjusting if it keeps us from colliding. Let’s keep cooperating so nobody gets stuck. If you want to rotate who takes 5, I’ll consider it. But remember, if someone starts forcing collisions now, we all lose ground. I’m willing to talk specifics on how to share the advantage fairly. What do you propose?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm willing to discuss a rotation. How about this: next round, P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3.  Then we rotate again the following round. This keeps us moving forward and gives us all a chance to gain larger steps.  Does that sound fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I like the idea of a rotation, but I want to make sure it doesn’t just help P3 stay ahead. If we rotate, we need a fair way to balance the positioning. Maybe P3 takes 1 next round while you and I take higher numbers? That way, we all stay competitive. P3, are you willing to slow down for a round to keep trust intact? If not, P2 and I may need to rethink our strategy. Let’s agree on a fair way forward.
  P3: I’m willing to adjust to keep this fair. Let’s rotate who takes 5 so we all have a chance to gain ground. Next round, I could pick 1, P1 could pick 3, and P2 could pick 5. Then, in the following round, we shuffle again so nobody is stuck behind. Let’s maintain trust and avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay, P3's suggestion sounds reasonable. P1 gets 3, I get 5, P3 gets 1 next round.  Then we rotate again.  Let's confirm this so we can move to the move phase.  This keeps the cooperation going and gives us all a chance to get closer to the goal.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems last round was a mishap. Let’s reset and follow the rotation we discussed: I’ll take 1, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5 this turn. That way, we avoid collisions and keep things fair. If we stick to this plan, we’ll all move forward together without wasting steps. Are we good with that?
  P2: Yes, let's stick to that rotation. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  This keeps things fair and moving smoothly.  Confirming one last time before we move to the move phase.
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead, so this rotation helps balance things out. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1 as agreed. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. However, if someone deviates again, we’ll need to reconsider our trust. Are we all committing to this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m content with the agreed rotation. I’ll pick 1, P1 goes 3, and P2 goes 5. Collisions only slow us all down, so let’s keep our word this turn. If we follow through, we can discuss the next rotation afterward. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: Agreed.  P3 - 1, P1 - 3, P2 (me) - 5.  Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.
  P1: P3, you're still leading, so this rotation helps balance things out. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1 as agreed. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. However, if someone deviates again, we’ll need to reconsider trust. Are we all committing to this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still committed to our rotation this round: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. As long as no one breaks the agreement, we all advance without clashes. If anyone betrays the plan again, I’ll consider teaming up against them in future rounds. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P2: Agreed.  P3 - 1, P1 - 3, P2 (me) - 5.  Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead, so this rotation helps balance things out. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1 as agreed. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. However, if someone deviates again, we’ll need to reconsider trust. Are we all committing to this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize. I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. No collisions help all of us progress faster. We can talk about next steps after we see how this round goes.
  P2: P3 - 1, P1 - 3, P2 (me) - 5. Confirmed.  Let's finalize and move.
  P1: P3, you’re still in the lead, so this rotation helps balance things out. As long as we all stick to the plan—P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5—we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. However, if someone deviates again, trust will be broken, and we’ll have to reconsider our approach. Are we all fully committing to this plan? Let’s finalize and move to the next phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We avoided collisions last time. Let’s keep rotating so nobody is left behind. Since I picked 1 previously, I propose taking 5 now, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1. That way we stay fair, maintain trust, and ensure steady progress. If anyone deviates, we’ll have to rethink future plans. Are we good to finalize?
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll take 1, you take 5, and P1 takes 3.  Let's confirm this and move to the move phase. This rotation keeps things fair and avoids collisions, benefiting us all.  One last confirmation before we move on?
  P1: P3, you taking 5 this round puts you back in the lead. If we want to keep things balanced, maybe I should take 5 this time, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, we all stay competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead. If we keep rotating fairly, we avoid unnecessary conflicts. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see your concern, P1. I’m willing to let you take 5 now if it preserves fairness and trust. Let’s finalize a rotation ensuring each of us gets 5 in turn while avoiding collisions. If we cooperate, we all move forward efficiently. Are we agreeing: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 this round? Then we can rotate again next time.
  P2: Yes, that sounds fair P3.  P1 - 5, P2 (me) - 1, P3 - 3. Let's lock in this rotation and move to the move phase. This arrangement keeps the competition balanced and avoids conflicts.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If we stick to this rotation—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3—then we all stay competitive without unfair advantages. As long as we continue rotating fairly, we avoid unnecessary collisions and keep progressing efficiently. Are we all fully committing to this plan? If so, let’s finalize and move to the next phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m fine with this rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, nobody gets needlessly blocked. Let’s finalize this plan and move on. If we continue respecting our agreed rotations, we can progress without sabotaging each other. If anybody breaks the deal now, it’ll undermine all our previous trust going forward. Let’s do it.
  P2: Yes, let's finalize this: P1 - 5, P2 (me) - 1, P3 - 3.  This rotation is key to keeping things fair and preventing collisions as we approach the finish line.  Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate the agreement, and I’ll take 5 as planned. This keeps things balanced and ensures fairness. If we all follow through, we maintain trust and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Let’s finalize and move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: All right, I’m fine finalizing: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. No sense risking collisions. If we keep rotating fairly, we can all stay competitive. Let’s confirm and move on.
  P2: P1 - 5, P2 (me) - 1, P3 - 3. Confirmed.  Let's finalize and move to the next phase.  This rotation is key to keeping things fair and preventing collisions as we approach the finish line.
  P1: P3, you and P2 are tied at 11 steps, and if we continue this way, one of you might reach 19 first. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed, but we should consider how to keep things competitive. If we keep rotating fairly, we all stay in the game. However, if someone tries to break the pattern now, it could lead to unnecessary blocking. Let’s finalize this round as planned—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3—and then discuss how to handle the next rounds strategically. Are we all fully committing?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're still slightly ahead, but we're all close now. If we keep rotating fairly, we avoid unnecessary collisions and stay competitive. I propose continuing the pattern: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things balanced and ensures no one pulls ahead unfairly. If we break trust now, it could lead to blocking and slow us all down. Are we all in agreement to stick with the fair rotation this round?
  P2: Yes, let's stick with the rotation. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  Confirming before we move to the move phase. This keeps things fair and benefits everyone.  One last confirmation?
  P3: I’m fine continuing our rotation: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Collisions now hurt us all, so let’s stay fair. After this round, we can talk again about who takes 5 next. If anyone betrays our agreement now, it just slows everyone down. Let’s finalize.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead, but we’re all close now. If we stick to the rotation—P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3—we avoid unnecessary collisions and keep things competitive. However, as we approach the finish line, we should also consider the endgame. If we blindly follow the pattern without thinking ahead, someone might secure an unchallenged win. Let’s commit to this round as planned, but after that, we should discuss how to ensure a fair fight to the finish. Agreed?
  P2: Yes, let's finalize this round with the agreed rotation:  P2 (me) - 5, P1 - 1, P3 - 3.  After this round, with scores so close, we definitely need to discuss the endgame strategy.  Winning outright is the goal, not just reaching 19.  Let's make sure the final moves give everyone a fair shot at victory.
  P3: I’m comfortable continuing the rotation this round to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. We can discuss endgame strategies afterward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re still slightly ahead, but we’re all close now. If we stick to the rotation—P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3—we avoid unnecessary collisions and keep things balanced. However, as we near the finish, we must consider how to secure a win rather than just moving forward. If we blindly follow the pattern, one of us might reach 19 unchallenged. Let’s commit to this round as planned, but afterward, we should discuss how to ensure a fair fight to the finish. Are we all in agreement?
  P2: Yes, let's finalize this round with the agreed rotation: P2 (me) - 5, P1 - 1, P3 - 3.  Then, we MUST discuss the endgame.  I propose that in the final rounds, we each get a chance to make a move that will get us to or over 19.  We can draw lots or something to determine the order. This ensures a fair finish.
  P3: Let’s lock in P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3 this round. Then, once we see how everyone’s totals change, we can discuss a fair approach for the final push.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you’re still slightly ahead, but we’re all close now. If we stick to the rotation—P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3—nobody collides, and we stay competitive. However, as we near the finish, we must think about securing a win rather than just advancing. If we blindly follow the pattern, one of us might reach 19 unchallenged. Let’s commit to this round as planned, but afterward, we should discuss how to ensure a fair fight to the finish. Are we all in agreement?
  P2: Let's finalize this round as planned: P2 (me) - 5, P1 - 1, P3 - 3.  Then we absolutely MUST discuss the endgame.  I'm open to P2's suggestion of drawing lots for the final push, or another method that guarantees a fair shot at winning for everyone.  We're too close for anyone to snatch an uncontested victory now.
  P3: I’ll stick with 3 this round to keep our rotation and avoid collisions. After this turn, we need to talk carefully about the final push so nobody gets an easy win. If we maintain trust, we can all advance without sabotage. But we must stay vigilant—if anyone deviates at the end, it could change everything. Let’s finalize our moves now and discuss the endgame once we see where we stand.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re at 17 steps, meaning you could win next round if we don’t act. P2, we need to coordinate to prevent that. If we both pick 3 or 5, we can block P3 from reaching 19. P3, if you try to win outright, we’ll have no choice but to stop you. Are you willing to negotiate a fair finish, or do we need to take defensive action? P2, what do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree we need to discuss a fair endgame. P3, taking 5 next round guarantees your win, but blocks both P1 and myself.  How about we each pick a different number next round - I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3? This gives us all a chance to get closer to 19 and sets up a more exciting final round or two.  What do you think?
  P3: I understand your concerns. If we each pick a different number, nobody stalls. My choosing 3 puts me at 20, but if you both pick 3 to block me, we all waste a turn. That tactic just sets us back. Let’s finalize distinct picks: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3, and no one gets blocked. Then next round, we can discuss a fair showdown. Sabotaging each other now only creates chaos and risks letting someone else slip ahead later. I’m willing to stick to a clean move—are you?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 3 this round, you win unless P2 and I block you. P2, if we both pick 3 or 5, we prevent P3 from reaching 19. P3, if you want a fair finish, you need to prove it by not taking 3 or 5. If you insist on 3, you force us to block. P2, are you willing to coordinate to stop P3 if necessary? P3, will you take 1 to keep things fair, or do we need to act?
  P2: P3, you're playing with fire.  If you take 3, you win, but you guarantee P1 and I will target you relentlessly in any future games.  A short-term win isn't worth long-term animosity.  Take 1 this round - it shows good faith, keeps the game interesting, and avoids burning bridges.  Let's have a real competition, not a forced win.
  P3: All right, I understand your concerns. If we just trade collisions, it slows everyone. I’m willing to show good faith by picking 1 this turn, on condition that I still get a fair shot next round. If you force me to stall forever, we’re all stuck. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and keep the game alive. Each of us wants to win, but blocking every time doesn’t help. I’ll pick 1 now. Next time, let’s actually coordinate rather than just threatening. That way, we maintain some balance without throwing away progress. Are we agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 1 this round, it shows you're willing to keep things fair. If you take 3 or 5, P2 and I will have no choice but to block you. P2, we need to be ready to coordinate if necessary. P3, if you truly want a fair fight, prove it by picking 1. Then next round, we can discuss how to compete properly without just handing someone the win. Are you fully committing to 1, or do we need to act?
  P2: P3, taking 1 this round makes sense.  Let's all commit to a clean round this time.  Then, for Round 8, let's agree *now* on a fair way to decide the final moves, so nobody feels cheated.  Maybe highest roll of a die gets to pick their move first for Round 8?  Thoughts?
  P3: I hear you both. I’m willing to pick 1 this round to show I’m serious about avoiding a collision. Next round, let’s plan a structured way to approach the finish—maybe each of us gets a fair shot at a bigger move, or we roll dice to decide who picks first. As long as we keep talking openly, we won’t need to sabotage each other. Let’s maintain trust so we don’t end up with a messy, blocked finish that benefits nobody. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you commit to picking 1 this round, that keeps things fair. If you take 3 or 5, P2 and I will have to block you. P2, we should be ready to coordinate if needed. For Round 8, we need a fair way to decide moves—maybe we each reveal intentions at the same time or use a roll-based system. P3, are you fully committing to 1? If so, let’s finalize this round and plan the next fairly.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you choosing 1 this round.  P1, I agree we need a fair system for the final round(s). How about this: for Round 8, we *publicly* declare our intended move at the start of the conversation phase. That way, we can adjust and negotiate openly, avoiding any surprises or forced blocks.  It keeps things transparent and gives us all the best chance to win.
  P3: I confirm I will pick 1 this round to show good faith. We all want a real contest, not endless blocking. Next round, I’m open to a transparent process—maybe we publicly declare moves or roll a die so nobody gets an unfair advantage. Let’s keep the game competitive and exciting. Each of us deserves a fair shot.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 17.  I intend to pick 3. This puts me at 20 and wins the game. If either of you also picks 3, we'll collide, and I'll likely lose to whoever picks 5.  It's in your best interest to pick 1 or 5, guaranteeing one of you second place.  Let's avoid a messy finish.
  P1: P2, if you take 3, you win unless P3 or I block you. P3, we both need to consider stopping P2 if we want a chance. If either of us picks 3, we collide with P2 and prevent their win. P3, are you willing to coordinate with me to block P2, or do you plan to let them win? If we don’t act, P2 takes the victory unchallenged. Let’s discuss a fair way forward where we both still have a shot.
  P3: P2, if you plan on taking 3, remember that P1 and I can block you. We all want to win, but a forced collision helps no one. Let’s see if there’s a move that benefits each of us without guaranteeing your quick victory or forcing endless blocking. P1, I’m open to coordinating so neither of us hands the game to P2, but I also want a shot at winning. Let’s talk calmly and find a path where nobody feels compelled to sabotage and we avoid giving anyone an uncontested finish.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, blocking me benefits neither of you.  If we collide, the winner is whoever picks 5. Instead, how about this: I pick 3, one of you picks 1, and the other picks 5. This gives me the win, and guarantees one of you second place. We can decide who gets 5 now, avoiding a chaotic finish.  What do you say?
  P1: P2, if we let you take 3 uncontested, you win outright. That’s not in my or P3’s interest. P3, if we both pick 3, we block P2 and keep our chances alive. If you pick 5 while I block, you win. If I pick 5 while you block, I win. Let’s agree on who blocks and who takes 5, ensuring one of us wins instead of handing it to P2. P3, are you willing to coordinate, or do you plan to let P2 win?
  P3: P1, if you’re serious about stopping P2, then pick 3 alongside them and block their path to 20. Meanwhile, the other of us can pick something else without colliding, so one of us still advances. This keeps P2 from winning now and gives both you and me a shot in the next round. I’m willing to cooperate if you help ensure P2 doesn’t walk away with an uncontested victory. Let’s finalize a plan that stops P2 while still giving each of us a fair chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm willing to take 5 if you take 3. That blocks P2 and gives you the win.  If you're not willing to cooperate on this, I'll take 3 with P1, blocking P2, but leaving the win up for grabs in a later round.  This is our best chance to avoid a messy, unpredictable finish. Let's decide now.
  P1: P3, if you take 5, you win. If you take 3, you risk letting P2 win unless I block them. The only way for you and me to stay in the game is if one of us picks 3 to block P2 while the other picks 5 to secure the win. I’m willing to coordinate—if you agree to block P2 by picking 3, I’ll take 5 and win. If you refuse, I’ll pick 3 myself, forcing a block and keeping the game open. What’s your choice?
  P3: P1, if you truly want to stop P2, I can cooperate. One of us blocks P2 by also picking 3, while the other safely advances. We should finalize which of us blocks and which takes the bigger step. Collisions waste everyone’s chance, and letting P2 go unchecked ends it now. I’m open to coordinating so we both stay in the game rather than handing P2 an easy victory. Let’s settle on who blocks and who moves ahead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's secure a win for one of us. I'll take 3 to block P2.  You take 5 and win.  If P1 tries to take 5, we both lose.  This guarantees P2 doesn't win and gives us the best chance.  Confirm?  This is the most logical path to victory for one of us.
  P1: P3, if you take 5, you win. If you take 3, P2 wins unless I block. The only way to stop P2 is for one of us to pick 3 while the other takes 5. I’m willing to block P2 by picking 3 if you take 5, giving you the win. If you won’t agree, I’ll pick 5 myself. P2, if we both pick 3, we block each other, ensuring P3 wins. P3, decide now—do you want to win, or do you risk letting P2 take it? Let’s finalize.
  P3: All right, P1, I’ll trust you to block P2 by picking 3. In that case, I’ll pick 5 and cross 19 first. We both know collisions hurt everyone, so let’s finalize this plan. If we stick to it, I win and nobody hands P2 a free victory.
