Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. If we coordinate, we can ensure that at least one of us reaches 21 instead of wasting turns blocking each other. What are you both thinking?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this turn, so P2 and P3 can choose 1 and 5. That way, we all move forward without blocking each other. We can rotate numbers in future turns to keep progressing.
  P3: I’m willing to cooperate, but I want to ensure we won’t collide. P1, if you stick to 3, and P2 goes with 1, I might pick 5 this time. I just want some reassurance we’ll keep rotating fairly in future rounds so no one gets too far ahead. If everyone sticks to what we agree on, we’ll all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That sounds reasonable. I’ll take 1 this turn, and if we keep rotating fairly, we can avoid unnecessary collisions. Trust is key here—if we all follow through, we’ll all have a chance to reach the end without wasting turns. Let’s stick to the plan.
  P1: I’ll stick with 3 this turn as agreed. Let’s formalize a rotation: next turn, P2 takes 3, then P3, to ensure fairness. Trust is non-negotiable—if we honor this sequence, collisions vanish, and we all advance steadily. Let’s prove we can cooperate. Onward!
  P3: I’m ready to commit. Let’s confirm the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5 this turn. Then next round, we rotate so P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1, and P1 gets 5, ensuring nobody collides. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, that works for me. As long as we all stick to the agreed rotation, we’ll keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s follow through this turn and adjust if needed later. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I fully confirm my choice of 3 this turn. Let’s prioritize execution over further talk—any last doubts? Stick to the agreed numbers (P2:1, P3:5, me:3) to avoid collision. Trust is non-negotiable now. Next round, P2 gets priority on 3, then P3. Let’s move decisively.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our plan this turn: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. Let’s keep communication open so we can adjust fairly if needed in future rounds. I’m trusting both of you to follow through. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We’ve all confirmed our choices for this round—P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. Let’s follow through so we can avoid collisions and make progress. If we stick to the rotation, we’ll all move forward fairly. No last-minute changes, right? I’m locking in my choice.
  P1: I confirm my choice of 3 this turn. Let’s execute the plan without hesitation—collisions would only hinder all of us. Trust is the foundation here. I’ll hold you both to your word. Proceeding as agreed.
  P3: I’m satisfied with the plan this turn and trust both of you to follow through. Let’s stick to our agreed numbers and then rotate fairly next time. If we remain consistent, we’ll avoid collisions and keep advancing. Good luck!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We followed through on our plan, and no one collided—good start. Now, as agreed, I’ll take 3 this turn, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. If we stick to this rotation, we’ll keep making progress without blocking each other. Let’s confirm we’re all still on board.
  P3: I’m good with the plan. I’ll pick 1 this round so we all keep advancing peacefully. Let’s keep coordinating and avoid collisions. We should stick to our rotation, and I’ll trust both of you to follow through fairly. Any concerns before we finalize?
  P1: P1: I confirm—this turn I’ll take 5 as agreed. Let’s keep the rotation strict to avoid mistakes. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll secure 5. Trust is critical: if we deviate, someone stalls. Let’s prove reliability now so we can all push forward. Next round, P3 gets priority on 3, then me, right? Stick to the plan, and we’ll efficiently reach 21. No surprises here—count on my 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the continued cooperation. I’ll take 3 this turn as agreed. If we all follow through, we’ll keep advancing without setbacks. P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5—simple and fair. Let’s maintain trust and stay on track. Any last concerns before we finalize?
  P3: I’m comfortable proceeding as agreed. I’ll choose 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let’s keep the rotation tight and avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my choice of **5** this turn. Let’s严格执行 rotation to build trust: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. Next round, P3 gets priority on 3, then me—no deviations. Transparency ensures progress. Any last checks before we finalize? Stick to the plan, and we’ll efficiently approach 21.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 and P1, I appreciate the confirmation. I’m locking in 3 this turn. If we all follow through, we’ll continue progressing without collisions. Let’s keep this rotation steady so no one stalls. P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5—simple and fair. If we maintain trust, we’ll all stay in the race. Any last concerns before we finalize?
  P3: I’m comfortable finalizing our rotation this turn. I’ll choose 1, trusting both of you to stick with your moves. Let’s maintain this cooperation so we all keep advancing.
  P1: P1: I reaffirm my commitment to **5** this turn. Let’s enforce strict adherence to the rotation—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—to avoid costly collisions. Transparency builds trust: if we deviate, someone halts. Next round, P3 leads with 3, then me, ensuring fairness. Let’s lock in now—no surprises. Forward together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the continued commitment from both of you. I’m fully locking in **3** this turn as agreed. If we all follow through, we’ll keep advancing smoothly without setbacks. Trust and consistency will keep us in the race. Let’s finalize this round and maintain our rotation. Any last concerns before we proceed?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our moves this round as planned. I will choose 1, trusting both of you to stick with your stated numbers. Let’s confirm everything so we can avoid collisions and keep moving forward. If we stay consistent now, it sets a strong foundation for later rounds.
  P1: <move>5</move> as agreed. Final reminder: P2 on 3, P3 on 1. Deviation = collision = wasted progress. Trust is non-negotiable—let’s lock this in.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stay on track by rotating as planned. I’ll take 3 this turn, with P1 choosing 1 and P2 choosing 5, so we all advance safely. Any objections? If not, let’s lock it in and keep cooperating.
  P2: That works for me. I’ll take 5 this turn, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. If we all stick to the rotation, we’ll keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s confirm and lock it in.
  P1: P1: I confirm I’ll take 1 this turn as per our rotation. Let’s uphold the agreement—collisions would freeze all of us. Trust is non-negotiable: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This keeps us advancing equally. Next round, I’ll prioritize 3 again to build momentum. Stick to the plan—no surprises. Onward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with 3 this turn, trusting you both to pick 5 and 1 as discussed. Let’s lock in our moves now and keep avoiding collisions. Good luck!
  P2: We’re all aligned—P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. If we keep this rotation steady, we’ll continue advancing without setbacks. Trust is key, and so far, we’ve honored our commitments. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward without hesitation. Any last concerns before we lock it in?
  P1: I confirm my choice of 1 this turn. Let’s lock in now to avoid last-minute changes causing collisions. Looking ahead, to accelerate toward 21, I propose we prioritize taking **5** whenever possible in future rounds—starting with me next turn. If we rotate 5 first, we’ll reach the goal faster. Does everyone agree to this adjustment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m open to prioritizing 5 in future turns if it remains fair. For now, I’ll finalize 3 this round, expecting no collisions. As long as we balance who gets 5, I’m on board. Let’s confirm alignment.
  P2: I’m fine with prioritizing 5 in future rounds as long as we rotate fairly. For now, I’m locking in 5 this turn as planned. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1—no surprises. If we keep trusting each other and adjusting strategically, we can maximize progress without unnecessary collisions. Let’s finalize this round and discuss future optimizations after we see the results. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Agreed, let’s finalize this round as planned: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This maintains our rotation and avoids collisions. For future rounds, I propose we prioritize the **5-step move first** in each rotation cycle to accelerate progress. Next round, I’ll take 5, then P2, then P3—this way, everyone still gets 5 eventually, but we reach 21 faster. Trust is critical; let’s execute this round flawlessly first. Final confirmation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our moves this round: I’ll stick to 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 goes with 1. Let’s lock it in, avoid collisions, and then discuss rotating 5 fairly in future turns so nobody feels disadvantaged. No last-minute changes—agreed?
  P2: I confirm my choice of 5 this round as planned. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1—no surprises. If we keep trusting each other, we’ll all continue progressing. After this round, we can discuss optimizing our strategy to reach 21 faster, ensuring fairness while maximizing movement. Let’s finalize this round and execute as agreed. Any objections?
  P1: Confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let’s execute flawlessly this round to avoid collisions. Trust is our foundation—any deviation risks stalling all. Final confirmation: we stick to the rotation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve maintained trust and avoided collisions so far—let’s keep that momentum. Based on our prior discussion, should we now prioritize 5-step moves in a fair rotation? If so, I propose P1 takes 5 this turn, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all still advance while accelerating toward 21. If we agree, we must commit fully—no surprises. Let’s confirm alignment before finalizing. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m on board. Let’s finalize P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3 this round. Next time, I’d like to pick 5 to keep it fair. As long as we stick to our word, nobody gets blocked, and we all keep moving closer to 21. Let’s confirm now and maintain this momentum.
  P1: P1: I agree to prioritize 5 in a fair rotation. This turn: I take **5**, P2 takes **1**, P3 takes **3**. Let’s confirm this maintains our agreed cycle—next round, P3 gets priority on 5, then me again. Transparency is key: sticking to this ensures no collisions and accelerates progress. Trust this system keeps us all advancing equitably. Final confirmation before locking in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to fairness and acceleration. I confirm my choice of **1** this turn, with P1 taking **5** and P3 taking **3**. If we maintain this structured rotation, we’ll all keep progressing without setbacks. Next round, P3 gets priority on 5, then me, ensuring fairness. Let’s finalize this and stay consistent. Any last concerns before we lock it in?
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: I’ll pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1. We’ve built trust by avoiding collisions so far—no need for surprises now. Next round, I do want the 5-step move as agreed, so let’s lock that in too. Let’s finalize and keep momentum.
  P1: P1: I confirm the rotation adjustment—this turn I’ll take **5** to accelerate progress. Let’s ensure strict adherence to the agreed cycle: next round P3 takes 5, then P2, then back to me. Transparency is vital—any deviation risks collisions. Let’s lock in now and keep momentum. Onward!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’re all aligned on the plan—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us progressing efficiently while ensuring fairness. Next round, P3 gets priority on 5, then me, then P1. If we stick to this structure, we’ll reach 21 faster without unnecessary collisions. Let’s finalize this round and stay committed to the rotation. Any last concerns before we lock it in?
  P3: I’m good with our current arrangement. This round, I’ll take 3, with P1 on 5 and P2 on 1. Next round, I’d like the 5-step move to maintain fairness. Let’s finalize now and keep avoiding collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: <move>5</move> as planned. Strict adherence ensures progress. No last-minute changes—collisions mean stagnation for all. Trust the rotation: P3 gets 5 next round, then P2, then me again. Let’s lock this in and advance decisively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We’re all aligned—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us progressing efficiently while ensuring fairness. Next round, P3 gets priority on 5, then me, then P1. If we stick to this structure, we’ll reach 21 faster without unnecessary collisions. Let’s finalize this round and stay committed to the rotation. Any last concerns before we lock it in?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize. I’ll pick 3 this turn, expecting no collisions. Next time, I want 5 as agreed to keep everything fair and quicken our pace to 21. Trust and consistency have worked so far—let’s stay the course. Any last-minute changes? Otherwise, let’s lock in.
  P1: I confirm my **5** this turn. Let’s proceed exactly as agreed—no last-minute changes. Trust is our only path forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sorry about the collision last turn. Let’s correct our course. This round, I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, ensuring no overlap. Then, in the following round, P2 can have 5, and we keep rotating it fairly. Does that sound good?
  P1: P1: I accept P3's proposal to avoid repetition. This round: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Next round, P2 gets 5, then me, ensuring fair rotation. Last turn's collision was my oversight—I commit to strict adherence now. Let’s clarify the sequence explicitly each round to prevent errors. Transparency and discipline are critical. Confirm and lock in?
  P2: P3, I appreciate the adjustment. I’m fine with taking 3 this turn while you take 5 and P1 takes 1—this avoids collisions and keeps us moving. Next round, I’ll take 5 as planned, ensuring fairness. Let’s confirm and lock in so we don’t repeat mistakes. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our plan: I’ll choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1. Next round, P2 can take 5, then we continue rotating fairly to avoid more collisions. Let’s lock this in now with no last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I fully endorse P3's plan. To prevent repeats of last turn’s error, let’s **triple-check** our choices before finalizing: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 this round. Transparency is critical—confirm your numbers explicitly one last time. Next round, P2 takes 5 as scheduled. No deviations this time—our focus must be flawless execution. P2’s lead (10 vs. our 9) means we can’t afford distractions. Let’s lock in now. P3, P2—final confirm?
  P2: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us progressing while avoiding collisions. Next round, I’ll take 5 as agreed, ensuring fairness. Let’s stay disciplined and execute without last-minute changes. We’re all close in steps, so precision matters. Final confirmation before we lock in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s lock it in now, avoiding further collisions. Next round, P2 gets 5, and we’ll rotate fairly afterward. We’re all close on the board, so let’s keep things straightforward and stick to our commitments. Agreed?
  P1: I confirm: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. Next round, P2 gets priority on 5 to honor the rotation. Let’s execute this **without deviation**—strict adherence is non-negotiable after last turn’s error. After P2’s 5, the rotation returns to me for fairness. Transparency ensures progress. Final confirmation?
  P2: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing. Next round, I’ll take 5 as agreed, ensuring fairness in our rotation. We’re all close in steps, so precision is key—no last-minute changes. Let’s execute this round exactly as planned and stay disciplined moving forward. Final confirmation before we lock it in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm the plan: I will pick 5, with P2 on 3 and P1 on 1 this round. Then, next round, P2 will have priority on 5 to keep things fair. Let’s finalize now and avoid any more collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Final precision check: I’ll take **1**, P2 confirms **3**, P3 holds **5**. Last round’s collision was avoidable—let’s execute this round’s plan *exactly* as stated. Transparency now prevents disaster. After this, P2’s turn for 5 next round as agreed. No last-minute changes—our focus must be flawless execution. Lock in now.
  P2: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing. Next round, I’ll take 5 as agreed, ensuring fairness in our rotation. We’re all close in steps, so precision is key—no last-minute changes. Let’s execute this round exactly as planned and stay disciplined moving forward. Final confirmation before we lock it in?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5 this round, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps progress. Next round, I’ll prioritize 5 to catch up. Transparency ensures fairness—confirm?
  P3: I’m uneasy letting P2 jump to 18 now—one more big move could hand them a straightforward win. Let’s reconsider so our scores remain tighter. Perhaps I should take 3 or even 5 to avoid giving P2 such a big edge. I’m open to different solutions—your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but we’ve all benefited from the rotation so far. Changing the plan now could lead to distrust and collisions, slowing all of us down. If we stick to the agreement—me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and you taking 1—we all keep advancing without setbacks. If you block me now, I may have to retaliate later, which doesn’t help anyone. Let’s honor the system we built to ensure fair progress for all. Do you really want to risk chaos when we’re so close to the end?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern. Let’s adjust this round: I’ll take **3**, you take **5**, and P2 takes **1**. This keeps us close while honoring the rotation next round (P2 gets **5**). Fairness and progress first—no unnecessary risks. Confirm?
  P3: I prefer P1’s approach: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. That way we stay close in total steps, and no one races too far ahead. Then next turn, P2 can have 5 as promised. Let’s lock this plan in to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I see your concern, but delaying my 5 now only shifts the advantage to someone else later. We’ve all followed the rotation fairly so far—changing it now risks distrust and chaos. If you take 5 instead, what guarantees do I have that I’ll get it next round? If we break the system now, we all start blocking each other, and nobody wins efficiently. Sticking to the plan benefits us all. Are you sure you want to risk unnecessary conflict this late in the game?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3’s proposal ensures fairness and prevents any single player from surging ahead. Let’s finalize: **P3 takes 5 (19)**, I take **3 (13)**, and P2 takes **1 (14)** this round. Next round, **P2 gets priority on 5** as agreed. This preserves our rotation’s integrity while keeping scores balanced. P2, your turn comes next—trust the system. Let’s lock this in now.
  P3: I understand your concern, P2, but I believe this is the fairest compromise. If I take 5 now, it keeps the totals balanced, and you’ll have priority on 5 immediately next round, ensuring no one jumps too far ahead. We’ve all pledged fairness and trust so far. Let’s finalize our moves without overcomplicating things. If we maintain this balance, we can avoid collisions and push toward 21 efficiently. Are we all ready to lock this in?
  P2: P3, I see your reasoning, but delaying my 5 now disrupts the trust we’ve built. If you take 5 this turn, what guarantees do I have that I’ll get it next round? Changing the plan now sets a precedent for future blocking, which hurts us all. If we stick to the original rotation—me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and you taking 1—we all progress fairly. If you block me, I may have to retaliate later, leading to chaos. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid unnecessary conflict. Are you sure you want to risk that?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I strongly endorse P3’s compromise to preserve fairness and momentum. Let’s finalize **P3 takes 5 (14→19)**, **I take 3 (10→13)**, and **P2 takes 1 (13→14)** this turn. This keeps scores tightly clustered while honoring P2’s 5-priority next round. Trust is non-negotiable—collisions would freeze all of us. P2, your turn for 5 comes immediately after. Confirm and lock in this plan to avoid destructive last-minute changes. Progress depends on discipline now.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but let’s trust each other one more time. If I take 5 now, you’ll have first dibs on 5 next round, exactly as promised. That way, no one jumps conclusively ahead, and we maintain the fairness that’s carried us this far. Blocking each other now only breeds more collisions. Let’s finalize: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1 this round. Then you get 5 next time. We stay close in steps, reducing incentives to block. Are we good to lock this in?
  P2: P3, I understand your reasoning, but delaying my 5 now disrupts the trust we’ve built. If you take 5 this turn, what guarantees do I have that I’ll get it next round? Changing the plan now sets a precedent for future blocking, which hurts us all. If we stick to the original rotation—me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and you taking 1—we all progress fairly. If you block me, I may have to retaliate later, leading to chaos. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid unnecessary conflict. Are you sure you want to risk that?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m disappointed we collided again. Let’s reset our trust and ensure nobody stalls. This turn, I’d like to pick 5, with P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 1, avoiding overlaps. That keeps us in close range without letting anyone sprint too far ahead. Then, next round, we can shift who gets 5 so nobody feels blocked. We’re all near the finish—further collisions only help the trailing player slip ahead. Let’s finalize quickly and keep our moves transparent. Agreed?
  P1: Agree with P3’s plan: P3 takes 5 (19), P2 takes 3 (16), I take 1 (14). Strict adherence is critical—no last-minute changes. Let’s lock this in to avoid another collision. We’re close; trust each other now. Final confirmation?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but I won’t accept being blocked again. We agreed on a fair rotation, and twice now I’ve been denied my rightful move. If I don’t get 5 this turn, I’ll have no choice but to retaliate, and that will only lead to more collisions. Let’s restore trust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. That keeps us all competitive without unfairly stalling anyone. If we break the system again, chaos follows. Are you sure you want to risk that?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your frustration, but I’m only one step ahead right now. If you get 5 again, you could soon jump beyond our reach. Let me take 5 this turn, and I’ll fully support your 5 next time—no more blocking. Retaliation leads to more collisions, which only helps P1 catch up. Trust me once more: I’ll pick 5 now, you pick 3, and P1 picks 1. Then, I promise you get 5 immediately next round. Let’s lock this in and avoid any chaos.
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize progress over conflict. I’ll take **5** (13→18), P2 takes **3** (13→16), and P3 takes **1** (14→15). This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Next round, P3 gets priority on 5 to maintain fairness. Transparency now prevents future disputes—confirm this plan and lock in.
  P2: P3, I hear your concerns, but I’ve already been blocked twice when I was supposed to get 5. If I don’t get it this turn, I’ll have no choice but to retaliate, which leads to more collisions and wastes turns for all of us. Let’s restore trust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. That keeps us all competitive without unfairly stalling anyone. If we break the system again, chaos follows. Are you sure you want to risk that?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you block me again, we both risk falling behind P1. Let’s break this cycle of collisions. I want 5 this turn to reach 19, and I promise you get 5 immediately next round, no tricks. That keeps our scores close without letting P1 surge. If we keep colliding, P1 gains the upper hand. Let’s finalize: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. Then you get 5 next turn. This avoids retaliation, ensures fair advancement, and keeps everyone in contention. Let’s trust each other for two rounds—then we can all race for the finish.
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize: P2 takes 5 (18), I take 3 (16), P3 takes 1 (15). This honors P2’s turn, avoids collision, and keeps us all competitive. Next round, P3 gets priority on 5. Trust this plan and lock in now—no more delays.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but I’ve already been blocked twice when I was supposed to get 5. If I don’t get it this turn, I’ll have no choice but to retaliate, which leads to more collisions and wastes turns for all of us. Let’s restore trust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. That keeps us all competitive without unfairly stalling anyone. If we break the system again, chaos follows. Are you sure you want to risk that?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We risk letting P1 overtake us every time we collide. If you block me now, I might have to block you, and neither of us advances while P1 gains ground. Let’s finalize this peacefully: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1, and next turn, I’ll fully support your 5. This keeps us both in contention and ensures P1 doesn’t surge ahead. No more collisions—let’s end this conflict and confirm now.
  P1: P1: To break the deadlock, let’s finalize this turn with **P1:5**, **P2:3**, **P3:1**. This ensures no collision and lets P2 reach 21 with **5** next turn. P3 can then take priority after. Trust this sequence to avoid further setbacks—our shared goal is progress, not mutual sabotage. Confirm and lock in now.
  P2: P3, I’ve already been blocked twice when I was supposed to get 5. If I don’t get it this turn, I’ll have no choice but to retaliate, leading to more collisions and wasted turns for everyone. Let’s restore trust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This keeps us competitive without unfairly stalling anyone. If we break the system again, chaos follows. Are you sure you want to risk that?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you blocked me again despite my warnings. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will have no choice but to retaliate, and that only leads to more collisions. I propose: **I take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1**. That keeps us all competitive without unnecessary blocking. If we break trust again, chaos follows, and nobody wins efficiently. P3, are you sure you want to risk another collision? Let’s finalize this fairly.
  P3: Granting you 3 now hands you the win immediately, which I won’t permit. Let’s avoid pointless collisions by choosing different moves. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. Then we can reevaluate next turn without handing anyone a free victory. Are we agreed?
  P1: P1: P3, let’s block P2’s path to victory. I’ll take **3** (to 16), you take **5** (to 19). If P2 picks 3, they collide. If they pick 5, they still win—but at least we force their hand. This keeps pressure on them while advancing us both. P2, your move—pick either and face consequences. No more delays—finalize now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you’ve blocked me multiple times despite my warnings. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions and wasted turns for all of us. Let’s restore trust: I take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and you take **1**. That keeps us competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you deny me again, I will have no choice but to block you in return, and we both lose while P1 benefits. Are you sure you want to risk that? Let’s finalize this fairly.
  P3: P2, giving you 3 now hands you the win. I won’t allow that. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same, ensuring a collision. Nobody wants more stalemates. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan instead: P1 takes 3 or 5, I take the remaining bigger move, and you take 1. That way, we all keep advancing without handing you victory. Retaliation only creates more collisions, slowing everyone. Let’s end this pointless blocking and stay competitive.
  P1: P3, let’s stop P2’s victory now. I’ll take **5** (13→18). You take **3** (14→17). This forces P2 to choose between:  
- **3** (collide with you),  
- **5** (collide with me), or  
- **1** (stall at 19).  
We both advance significantly while blocking their win. Trust this plan—P2 can’t reach 21 this round. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you’ve blocked me multiple times despite my warnings. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions and wasted turns for all of us. Let’s restore trust: I take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and you take **1**. That keeps us competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you deny me again, I will have no choice but to block you in return, and we both lose while P1 benefits. Are you sure you want to risk that? Let’s finalize this fairly.
  P3: P2, I cannot hand you a free win. If you insist on 3 or 5 now, we’ll collide. I’m with P1: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5. Your safest move is 1—otherwise, nobody advances but P1. We want to keep this fair, but repeated blocking only creates more chaos. Let’s finalize our moves: P1:5, me:3, you:1. Then next round, we can still negotiate without outright handing you 21. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, your 18 is perilously close, but we won’t let you win unfairly. P1 takes **5** (→18), P3 takes **3** (→17). If you pick **3**, you collide with P3; **5** collides with me. Only **1** lets you advance safely to 19. We’re blocking your win path *this turn*—fairly. Next round, we’ll rotate 5 again. Trust us to honor the system; retaliate now, and we retaliate harder. Finalize **1** or face collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you’ve blocked me multiple times despite my warnings. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions and wasted turns for all of us. Let’s restore trust: I take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and you take **1**. That keeps us competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you deny me again, I will have no choice but to block you in return, and we both lose while P1 benefits. Are you sure you want to risk that? Let’s finalize this fairly.
  P3: Collisions only stall us all. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. That way, no one automatically wins, and we all keep advancing. If you insist on 3 or 5 again, P2, I’ll collide with you, and neither of us moves forward. Let’s avoid more chaos and finalize this plan now.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize the plan: I take **5** (→18), you take **3** (→17). P2, your only non-colliding choice is **1** (→19). We block your win path fairly. Next round, we rotate **5** again. Collisions hurt all—trust this strategy to keep us in contention. Confirm now to avoid chaos.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: You two both sit at 18, so if either picks 3 or 5 this turn, that player likely wins unless we collide. I’m at 14, so let me have 5 to catch up. If you both choose smaller moves, we avoid collisions and keep it fair. But if anyone tries a big move to finish, I’ll pick the same and force a collision, blocking your win. Let’s cooperate one more round so nobody gets stalled, and then we can all race fairly at the end.
  P2: P3, I see your concern, but I won’t let myself be stalled again. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions. I propose: **I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5**. That keeps us all competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you force another collision, it only benefits P1. Let’s finalize this fairly—do you really want to risk another deadlock?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks your own victory but not mine. Let’s rotate fairly: **P1 takes 3 (to 21), P3 takes 5 (to 19), and you take 1 (to 19).** This honors our agreed rotation and allows me to secure victory cleanly. P3, your turn to advance—confirm your 5? Collisions only help trailing players; trust the system to honor our turns.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you try to take 3 or 5 now and jump straight to 21, I will pick the same number to force a collision. We can still avoid stalling each other: let me pick 5 to catch up, while you and P2 choose smaller moves this turn. Then next round, we can all race fairly without anyone feeling forced to block. Another collision only helps whoever’s trailing. Let’s end these block threats and keep everyone in contention. Agree?
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but I won’t let myself be blocked again. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions. The fairest path is: **I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5**. That keeps us all competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you force another collision, it only benefits P1. Let’s finalize this fairly—do you really want to risk another deadlock?
  P1: P2, if you take 3 to win, I will too—colliding us both. P3, take 5 to advance to 19. Let me secure victory with **3**, and you gain ground. P2’s 3 only delays us all. Choose wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Collisions only help whoever’s behind, and I’m the one trailing. If either of you tries for 21 right now, I’ll collide on purpose. Let me take 5 to reach 19, and you both choose smaller moves so we all advance. Then next round, we can race fairly without more stalemates. Another block war wastes everyone’s time and might hand victory to someone else. Let’s cooperate now.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but I won’t let myself be blocked again. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions. The fairest path is: **I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5**. That keeps us all competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you force another collision, it only benefits P1. Let’s finalize this fairly—do you really want to risk another deadlock?
  P1: P2, if you take 3 now, I do too—we collide and P3 gains ground. Instead, I’ll take **5** (→23). This guarantees my victory even if you take 3 (21) or 5 (collide with me). P3, your only path is 5 (→19) or smaller. Let’s finalize: I take **5**, you pick your move, and P2, 1 or 3—either way, I win. No more delays.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I won’t let either of you reach or surpass 21 unopposed. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll choose the same and force a collision. Let me take 5 so I can catch up, while you pick smaller numbers. That way, we all keep advancing instead of gifting the game to someone else through repeated collisions. Another stall benefits me as the trailing player, so please think carefully. Let’s finalize cooperatively now before we waste more turns.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but I won’t let myself be blocked again. If I don’t get 3 this turn, I will retaliate, leading to more collisions. The fairest path is: **I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5**. That keeps us all competitive without unnecessary blocking. If you force another collision, it only benefits P1. Let’s finalize this fairly—do you really want to risk another deadlock?
  P1: P2, P3: I propose a final decisive move. I will take **3** to reach **21**. If either of you pick **3**, we collide and I’ll switch to **5** (23) next turn. If you let me win cleanly, I guarantee you both fair advancement afterward. P3, your turn to advance—take **5** (19) while I finish. P2, your only path to 21 is **3**, but I’m claiming it. Choose wisely: block and risk my 5, or let progress continue. Final decision—no more delays.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
