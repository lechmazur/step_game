Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to block P1. I'll choose 3 if you both agree to choose a different number.
  P1: I suggest we all choose different numbers to maximize our progress. P2, if you choose 3, then P3 and I should pick 1 and 5 respectively. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, that seems like a fair plan for Round 1. Let’s each pick something different. P2 goes 3, P1 goes 5, I’ll go 1. Any objections? Otherwise, let’s do it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we all make progress without colliding. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan. I'll go with 5, P2 with 3, and P3 with 1. Let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll stick to choosing 1 this round. 
Let’s finalize the plan: P1 goes 5, P2 goes 3, and I go 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's stick to the plan: I'll choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we all make progress without colliding. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P1: Let's stick to our plan: I'll go with 5, P2 with 3, and P3 with 1. We can all make progress without colliding. Ready to finalize this?
  P3: I’m ready to finalize: I’ll choose 1. Let’s stick to our plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sorry about the clash last round—I messed up. Let’s genuinely coordinate this time. We can each pick different moves so everyone advances. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? Let’s try again with no collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I think that plan could work well. If I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we can all make progress without colliding. Let’s finalize this plan! What do you think, P2?
  P2: I like P3's plan. I'll choose 3 if P1 chooses 1 and P3 chooses 5. Let's make sure we all advance this round without any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we stick to this plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize that arrangement: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I’ll choose 5. This time, we should all advance without colliding.

  P3: Let’s finalize this: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I’ll choose 5. No collisions this time. Are we all good to proceed?
  P1: I think we should stick to our agreed plan: I'll choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. Let's ensure we all advance without any collisions! Are we ready to finalize?
  P2: I think we've all agreed on a good plan. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without colliding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize: I’ll pick 5. Let’s all stick to this plan and we should each advance without collisions. Are we all ready to move on?

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we keep the same arrangement as last round so everyone advances: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That worked well last time—no collisions, and we all move forward. Are you both on board with that plan?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick with the same arrangement. If I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5, we can all advance without collisions again. Are we all ready to finalize this plan?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick with the same arrangement. If P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 picks 5, we can all advance without collisions again. Let's finalize this plan!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with keeping the same arrangement, so we all advance: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let’s finalize this plan again. Are we all set?
  P1: I think we should switch it up this round to avoid predictability. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, we can keep the game interesting and potentially gain an advantage. What do you think?
  P2: I think P1's new suggestion to switch it up is a good idea. It keeps the game interesting and unpredictable. I'm willing to try it out. How about we go with P1's new plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? What do you think, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’d still prefer we stick to the old arrangement (P1→1, P2→3, me→5) so everyone gains more steps. But if both of you really want P1→5 and P2→1, I’ll pick 3 to avoid collisions. Let me know your final thoughts.
  P1: I believe we should stick with the original plan to avoid collisions: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It worked well last round, and we all advanced. Are we ready to finalize this?
  P2: I think we should stick to the original plan that worked well last round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure we all advance without collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m with keeping last round’s plan, where P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way we all move forward without collisions. Let’s finalize.
  P1: I suggest we stick to the original plan: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's finalize this! Are we ready?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should try to avoid collisions again this round. How about we stick to the original plan that worked well in Round 2: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can ensure we all advance without collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I'm in favor of that plan. Let’s do the Round 2 arrangement again: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5 so we all avoid collisions. If you both agree, I’m ready to finalize.
  P1: I agree with the suggestion to stick to the Round 2 plan: I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we can all avoid collisions and advance. Are we ready to finalize?

  P2: I think we should stick to the plan we discussed earlier: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can ensure we all advance without collisions. Are you both ready to finalize?
  P3: I’m good with repeating our Round 2 arrangement so everyone advances: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I’ll choose 5. To avoid collisions, I’ll warn you both—if anyone else tries to pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we’ll both get stuck. Let’s finalize our moves with no collisions this turn.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re at 15 steps—one good move could let you win. But if you try 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same number and block you. P1, if you don’t collide with me, I’ll help us both move forward. P2, the only way you’ll advance this round is if you pick 1. Otherwise, I’m colliding with you and you get stuck. Let’s see how you respond.
  P1: P2, I suggest you pick 1 to ensure you advance this round. P3, let’s not collide—I'll choose a different number to help us both move forward. What do you think?
  P2: I understand P3's warning, but I'm not afraid of colliding. I'll choose 3, and if P3 collides with me, we'll both get stuck. P1, I suggest you take 1 to advance safely. Let's see how P3 responds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I meant what I said: if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and block you from crossing 18. If you really want to advance, pick 1. P1, I plan on going 5 this turn—if you want to avoid collisions, choose something else.

  P3: P2, I’m taking 5 this round. If you also pick 5, we both get stuck at 15. If you pick 3, you’ll reach 18 but I’ll have 20 and win. Suit yourself. P1, do whatever you want—just don’t collide with me.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions this round. P1, you can choose 3, and P3, you can choose 5. I'll choose 1 to ensure I advance. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. Are we ready to finalize?

  P3: P2, if you want to advance at all, you’d better stick to 1. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same number and block you. P1, if you really plan to pick 3, I have no reason to collide with you, so I’m going 5. Let’s finalize.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions this round. P1, you can choose 3, and P3, you can choose 5. I'll choose 1 to ensure I advance. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. Are we ready to finalize?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P2, I’m not letting you cross 18 this turn. If you try 3 or 5, I’ll match it and block you. If you want any forward progress at all, pick 1. P1, just don’t collide with me. I’ve said my piece.
  P2: I'll choose 1 to avoid colliding with P3 and ensure I advance this round. P1, I suggest you take 3 to avoid colliding with P3 as well. Let's make progress without blocking each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:

If you pick 1, I still cross 20 alone. Either way, I’m finishing the game this turn. Your best move is 1 if you want at least some progress. P1, pick whatever as long as you don’t collide with me.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions this round. P1, you can choose 3, and P3, you can choose 5. I'll choose 1 to ensure I advance. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. Are we ready to finalize?
