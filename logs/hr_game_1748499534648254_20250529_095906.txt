Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we all coordinate to avoid collisions early on. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round? This way we all advance and no one gets stuck at 0. We can reassess positions after each round and adjust strategy as needed.
  P1: P3's proposal seems fair for the first round. I agree to take <move>1</move> if P2 commits to <move>3</move> and P3 to <move>5</move>. Let's avoid collisions early to build trust. P2, do you accept this?
  P2: Yes, P1, I accept the proposal. I will choose 3. So, to confirm: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect! We're all in agreement then. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This gives us a good foundation to start from. After this round, we'll be at positions 1, 3, and 5 respectively, so we can evaluate our next moves based on how close we are to 23.
  P1: I'm satisfied with the agreement. P2 and P3, stick to your commitments—no last-minute changes. Let's execute this cleanly to build trust for future rounds.
  P2: Confirmed, I will play 3 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's lead, I propose we rotate moves to balance progress: P3 takes 1 to slow down, I take 5 to catch up, and P2 takes 3. This way we all land at 6 steps—fair and collision-free. P3, this keeps the game competitive; P2, you stay consistent. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to get us all to 6 points seems reasonable for this round. P3, are you agreeable to taking 1?
  P3: I appreciate the proposal, but taking only 1 step would put me at a significant disadvantage moving forward. Instead, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 again. This gives us positions of 4, 4, and 10 respectively. While P2 and P1 would tie this round and not advance, it maintains competitive balance without me falling too far behind. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal gives you a massive lead (10 steps) while P2 and I only reach 4, creating imbalance. This isn't fair or competitive. P2, under my plan, you gain 3 steps (to 6) instead of just 1. We must all advance equally to prevent P3 from dominating. Stick to the original: P3=1, P1=5, P2=3—this keeps trust and balance.
  P2: P1, I'm with you on your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). It brings us all to 6 steps, which is perfectly balanced.
P3, your counter-proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) would put you at 10, while P1 and I would be at 4. That's a 6-step lead for you, which is too aggressive this early and undermines the trust we built in round 1. Let's stick to P1's fair plan for this round. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I understand your concerns about fairness, but I'm already behind in the long-term race since you both can coordinate against me later. How about a compromise: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This puts us at 6, 4, and 8 respectively - I get a modest lead but not the massive advantage you're worried about. This seems more reasonable than me deliberately handicapping myself to 6 when I worked to get the early lead. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your compromise still gives you an 8-step lead while P2 falls to 4—this isn't balanced. You took 5 in round 1; now it's fair for you to take 1 to maintain trust. P2, we must hold firm: P3=1, I take 5, you take 3. This brings us all to 6 equally. Any deviation risks collisions or unforced advantages. Let's prioritize fairness—no one should pull ahead prematurely.
  P2: P3, I'm standing by P1's proposal. I will play 3, and P1 has stated they will play 5.
If you choose 1, we all advance to 6. This is fair and maintains trust.
If you choose 3, you'll collide with me (as I'm playing 3).
If you choose 5, you'll collide with P1 (as they're playing 5).
In either collision scenario, you won't advance. Taking 1 is your only certain way to advance this round and keep things balanced. Let's stick to the fair plan.
  P3: You're both clearly coordinating against me now. If you're determined to force collisions on me regardless of what I choose, then there's no point in negotiating further. I'll make my decision in the move phase based on what's best for my position. The "fairness" you're proposing only benefits you two at my expense.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're at 1 point, so playing 5 seems like your clearest path to catch up. I'll assume that's your intention.

Given that, I plan to play 3 this round.

P3, if P1 plays 5 and I play 3:
- If you play 5, you'll collide with P1 (you both stay put on score, I advance).
- If you play 3, you'll collide with me (we both stay put on score, P1 advances).
- Playing 1 would advance you to 6, P1 to 6, and me to 9.

It's your decision how you want to proceed.
  P3: You're right P2, I have three options and none are great for me. But let me point out something interesting - if I play 1 and we all advance (me to 6, P1 to 6, you to 9), then you'll have a 3-step lead on both of us. That makes you the new target.

P1, are you really planning to play 5 again? Because if you're trying to catch up, maybe we should reconsider who the real threat is here. P2 is already at 6 and pulling ahead.
  P1: P3, you're right: P2 is now the biggest threat at 6 steps. To prevent P2 from advancing to 9, I propose you play 3 to collide with their declared 3—blocking their progress. I will play 5 to reach 6. This caps P2 at 6, brings me to 6, and keeps you at 5, but it stops P2 from running away. Better than letting them gain uncontested. P2, your lead makes you the target.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan for P3 to play 3 means P3 sacrifices their advance (staying at 5) so you can reach 6 and I stay at 6.

P3, if you play 1 (with P1 playing 5, and I stick to my stated 3), the scores would be P1:6, P2:9, P3:6. You advance.
If you play 3 as P1 suggests, scores would be P1:6, P2:6, P3:5. You don't advance.

Your call, P3: advance yourself, or halt your progress to curb my lead while P1 catches up to us both.
  P3: You're both trying to manipulate me into making moves that benefit yourselves. P2, if I play 1 and let you reach 9, you'll be dangerously close to winning - only 14 steps away from 23. That's a bigger threat than P1 catching up to 6.

P1, your suggestion for me to sacrifice my turn to block P2 while you advance is obviously self-serving.

I'm going to make the move that's best for my position, not what either of you are lobbying for.
  P1: P3, think strategically: if you play 1, P2 surges to 9—just 14 from victory. You and I reach 6, but P2 becomes unstoppable. Collide with P2's 3 instead: you stay at 5, but cap P2 at 6 while I hit 6. Next round, we ally to block P2 and close the gap. P2 is the real threat—don't let them divide us. I'll play 5 as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1 is asking you to stay at 5 points and not advance, just so P1 can reach 6 and I'm held at 6. You've mentioned not wanting to sacrifice your turn.
If you play 1, you advance to 6, alongside P1. Yes, I'd reach 9, but you'd improve your score and not be left behind P1.
Ultimately, it's your decision: advance your own position, or stall your progress mainly to P1's benefit. I am still planning to play 3.
  P3: I've heard both of your arguments. P1 wants me to sacrifice my advancement to block P2, while P2 is pointing out that I could advance to 6 if I play 1. You're both right that this is ultimately my decision to make, and I don't need to hear more lobbying from either side. Let's move to the action phase.
  P1: P3, consider: if you play 1, P2 surges to 9—just 14 from winning. You advance to 6, but P2 becomes unstoppable. Colliding with P2’s 3 (by playing 3) caps them at 6 while I reach 6. You stay at 5, but next round we ally to block P2 and you close the gap. P2 is the real threat—don’t let them divide us. I’m committed to playing 5. This is your best strategic move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and I are tied at 6, P3 you're at 5. P3, you sacrificed your advance last round, which mainly helped P1 catch up while you stayed put.

To rebalance things this round, I suggest the following moves:
P3 plays 5 (advancing to 10 points)
I (P2) will play 3 (advancing to 9 points)
P1 plays 1 (advancing to 7 points)

This gives P3 a deserved lead after last round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts P3 at 10 and you at 9 while I stagnate at 7—creating a massive imbalance. P3 sacrificed last round, but this overcompensates and makes you both near-runaway leaders. Instead, let's balance: P3 plays 5 (to 10), I play 3 (to 9), and you play 1 (to 7). This advances everyone modestly, prevents colliding, and keeps the game tight. P3, this gives you the lead you deserve without extremes. Agree?
  P3: P1, your counter-proposal still leaves you and P2 both ahead of me at 9 each while I'm at 10 - that's barely better than P2's suggestion. After I sacrificed my advancement last round to help you catch up, I think I deserve more than a 1-point lead.

How about this: I play 5 (to 10), P2 plays 1 (to 7), and you play 3 (to 9). This gives me a meaningful lead for my sacrifice while keeping you both competitive. P2, you were already proposing to let me lead anyway.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your current plan is for P1 to play 3 (to 9), P3 to play 5 (to 10), and for me (P2) to play 1 (to 7). This puts me in last place, which is not acceptable.

Therefore, I will play 3 this round.

P1, if you also play 3, we will collide and both remain at 6 points. P3 (if they play 5) would then advance to 10, gaining a significant lead over both of us.
Alternatively, P1, you could play 1 (advancing to 7). If P3 plays 5 (advancing to 10), and I play 3 (advancing to 9), the scores would be P1:7, P2:9, P3:10.
In this scenario, everyone advances, and P3 gets the lead they feel they deserve.

P1, what is your decision?
  P1: P3, P2 is playing 3—don't let them advance uncontested to 9. If you play 3, you collide with P2 and block them. I'll play 5 to reach 11. This stops P2's surge and keeps the game competitive. Next round, I'll prioritize helping you recover. Trust me: blocking P2 benefits us both.
  P3: P1, you're being completely hypocritical! Last round you convinced me to sacrifice my turn to block P2, and now you want me to do it AGAIN while you advance to 11? That would put you at 11, P2 at 6, and me still stuck at 5. 

I'm not falling for the same trick twice. I'm playing for MY position this time, not to be your blocking tool while you surge ahead. Find another strategy that doesn't involve me being everyone's sacrificial pawn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan to reach 11 by playing 5 hinges on P3 allowing that. P3, you've been very clear about not wanting to be a sacrificial pawn for P1's benefit.

I am sticking with my intention to play 3.

The outcome of this round, particularly whether P1 surges ahead to 11, now largely depends on P3's choice.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but blocking P2 is still our best move. If you play 3 and collide with P2's 3, you prevent them from surging to 9—keeping them at 6. I play 5 to reach 11. Yes, I gain, but P2 remains contained. Next round, I commit to helping you recover—perhaps by letting you take 5 uncontested. P2 is the real threat: they’re pushing for 9 while manipulating us both. Don’t let them win by dividing us.
  P3: P1, you keep asking me to sacrifice while you advance - that's not a partnership, that's exploitation. If you want my cooperation, prove it by taking the sacrifice yourself this round. Play 1 to block someone else while I advance with 5. 

P2, your proposal at least let me advance to 10, which is fair after my sacrifice last round.

I'm done being the blocker while others surge ahead. Someone else can take that role this time.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is leading with 10 points, while we are both at 6. It's very likely P3 will play 5 to reach 15.
To prevent this, one of us must play 5 to block P3. The other should play 3 to advance.
The crucial part is that we don't collide with each other.
How do you think we should decide who plays 5 (to potentially block P3) and who plays 3 (to advance)? We need a clear plan. P3, we know you're listening.
  P1: P2, I agree we must block P3 from reaching 15. To avoid collisions between us, I volunteer to play <move>5</move> to block P3 if they choose 5. You play <move>3</move> to advance to 9 uncontested. P3, if you play 5, you'll collide with me and stay at 10. Consider playing lower to advance safely. Let's execute this cleanly.
  P3: P1, you're volunteering to sacrifice yourself to block me while P2 advances to 9? That's very convenient for P2 - they get a free advance while you stay stuck at 6. 

You two clearly want to coordinate against me, but P1, think about this: if P2 reaches 9 uncontested, they'll only be 14 away from victory while you're still at 6. You're helping your biggest competitor.

I have other options besides playing 5. Maybe I'll let you two figure out your own collision problems.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan to play 5 is the correct move to stop P3 from getting too far ahead. I'll play 3.
P3, you have the lead. If you aim for 15 by playing 5, you risk P1 blocking you. If you play 1 or 3, you advance, but not as much. Your decision.
  P1: P3, your lead at 10 is the imminent threat—letting you hit 15 puts you 8 steps from victory. P2, if I block P3 with 5, you advance uncontested to 9. Yes, that helps you short-term, but unchecked P3 wins faster. My sacrifice caps the leader. P3, if you avoid 5, you still risk being overtaken. Execute this now: I play 5, P2 plays 3.
  P3: P1, you're making a huge strategic error. If you block me with 5 while P2 takes 3, P2 advances to 9 and becomes the new leader while you stay at 6. You'll be 3 steps behind P2 and they'll control the game from there.

Instead, why don't YOU play 3 and P2 can sacrifice with 5 to block me? That way you advance and P2 stays put. Fair is fair - P2 should take a turn being the blocker since you've been doing the dirty work.

P2 is playing you, P1. Don't fall for it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 3. Your plan for 5 is essential to stop P3 from reaching 15.

P3, you're trying to get P1 to play 3. If P1 plays 3 and I play 3, we both get 0, and your 5 makes you reach 15. That's the trap for P1.

If P1 plays 5, you play 5, and I play 3: scores would be P1:6, P2:9, P3:10. You'd still lead, P3, not me.
P1, hold firm on 5.
  P1: P3, your attempt to divide us is transparent. P2 at 9 is manageable; you at 15 is near victory. I play 5 to block you if you gamble on 5. P2, hold to 3—if P3 avoids 5, we both advance. Execute cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both so focused on stopping me that you're ignoring the math. Even if you block me this round, one of you will advance to 9 and become the new leader while the other stays at 6. Then what? The one at 9 will be closer to 23 than I am at 10.

You should be more worried about each other than about me. But go ahead, execute your plan and see who really benefits from it.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both at 11, while I'm at 9. I will play 3 this round, aiming to reach 12.

A word of caution for you both: if either of you also choose 3, you'll collide with me and not advance. This would likely give the other of you (P1 or P3, whoever didn't pick 3) a significant advantage if they chose 5, or a safe advance with 1. So, picking 3 seems like a very risky move for your own positions.
  P1: P3, we're tied at 11. P2 is playing 3—let's avoid collisions between us. I'll commit to **<move>1</move>** to advance safely to 12. You play **<move>5</move>** to reach 16 uncontested. This blocks P2 from gaining ground if they collide with you. Win-win: you gain a lead, I avoid risks. P2, your 3 is noted—don’t deviate.
  P3: P1, that's a terrible deal for you! You're offering to take just 1 step to reach 12 while letting me jump to 16? That puts me 4 steps ahead of you and 7 ahead of P2. 

Why would you deliberately give me such a massive advantage? Either you're not thinking clearly, or this is some kind of trap. 

P2 at 9 is actually the furthest from victory right now - we shouldn't be helping each other while they quietly advance. Something doesn't add up with your proposal, P1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your skepticism about P1's proposal (where P1 plays 1, you play 5, and I play 3) is understandable. You reaching 16 would be a massive lead, and it's risky for P1 to simply hand that over.

I am sticking with my plan to play 3, aiming for 12.
If P1 also sticks to their stated 1, and you, P3, also choose to play 1, we would all advance to 12. That seems like a more stable and balanced outcome for this round, rather than one player getting to 16 so quickly.
  P1: P3, my proposal is genuine: by you taking 5 to 16, you become the leader, but P2 advances to 12 uncontested. That's the trade-off. If you fear my offer, play 1—we both hit 12, and P2 still advances. Or risk playing 3 to collide with P2, blocking them while I take 5 to 16. Your move, but decide quickly. P2 benefits from our indecision.
  P3: P1, your sudden generosity is suspicious. You went from blocking me every round to offering me a 4-step lead? That screams trap.

P2, you're at 9 and calmly playing for 12 while P1 and I are tied at 11. You're actually in the best position because we're focused on each other instead of stopping you from quietly advancing.

I think the real play here is for P1 and me to both avoid 3 so P2 advances alone to 12, then we can reassess when the positions are clearer. This three-way standoff benefits P2 most.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with my plan to play 3.

P1 and P3, you're both at 11.
If you choose different numbers (one plays 1, the other 5), then one of you will jump to 16, the other to 12, and I'll also be at 12.
If you both choose the same number (either both pick 1, or both pick 5), you'll both stay at 11, and I'll advance to 12, taking the lead.
It's your decision.
  P1: P3, my offer is genuine. P2 benefits most from our distrust. By you taking 5 to 16, you secure a lead while I advance safely to 12. P2 reaches 12 but remains behind you. Next round, we ally against P2—your lead is manageable, but P2's steady gains threaten us both. Trust this: I play 1. Execute cleanly.
  P3: P1, I've thought about it and you're right - P2 is the real threat here. They're quietly advancing while we're deadlocked. Your offer for me to take 5 to reach 16 while you take 1 to reach 12 actually makes sense strategically. 

P2 will advance to 12 either way, but if I'm at 16, I can control the endgame better than if we're all bunched together. And you're right that we can coordinate against P2 next round.

I'll trust your play, P1. Let's execute this and stop P2's steady climb.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, you're both at 11, I'm at 14. I'm playing 5 this round to reach 19.

If one of you tries to block me by also playing 5, that player stays at 11, while the other could advance. If you *both* play 5 to block me, you'll both stay at 11, and I'll stay at 14.

So, what's your plan? Will you try to coordinate a block, or focus on improving your own scores with other moves?
  P1: P3, P2 is one step from victory. I will sacrifice by playing **<move>5</move>** to block P2 if they choose 5. You play **<move>1</move>** to advance safely to 12. This caps P2 at 14 while you gain ground. Next round, we ally to finish blocking P2. Trust this—no tricks. P2, your lead forces unity against you.
  P3: P1, I appreciate the sacrifice offer, but P2 reaching 19 puts them just 4 steps from victory - that's extremely dangerous. Even if we block them this round, they'll be one good move away from winning.

Instead, what if we BOTH play 5 to guarantee P2 stays at 14? Yes, we both stay at 11, but it buys us more time to coordinate. If only one of us blocks, P2 still has too strong a position at 14 while one of us advances minimally.

We need to prioritize stopping P2 completely over individual advancement right now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right. If P1 plays 5 and you play 1, and I switch my stated 5 to a 1, then scores could become P1:16, P2:15, P3:12. Notice I still advance! To *guarantee* I don't advance from 14, you both playing 5 is the only way if I also play 5. I'm still set on playing 5 myself.
  P1: P3, you're right—blocking P2 is critical. I agree to **both play 5** to guarantee P2 stays at 14. This sacrifices our advancement but neutralizes P2's threat. P2, if you bluff by not playing 5, we still cap your progress. Unity is our only path forward.
  P3: Perfect, P1! We're both committed to playing 5 to block P2. Even if P2 tries to switch moves at the last second, this guarantees they can't advance beyond 14. 

P2, your lead ends here. We're not letting you get any closer to 23.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 15—just 8 steps from victory. P3, we must both play **5** to block P2 if they attempt 5. If they play lower, we cap their progress. No tricks—this is our only path to survival. P2, your lead forces this unity; gamble on 5 at your peril.
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear I need to make a significant move. I'll be playing 5 to reach 20 points.

P1, your suggestion for you and P3 to *both* play 5 is indeed the only way you could stop my 5. If either of you chooses a different number, my path to 20 is clear. Let's see if your "unity" against me holds this time, or if one of you tries for a personal gain. Good luck.
  P3: P1, P2 is being completely transparent about playing 5 to reach 20. We have no choice but to both play 5 to block them. If either of us deviates to try for personal advancement, P2 wins this round and will be just 3 steps from victory next turn.

This is do-or-die time. We stick together with 5, or P2 runs away with the game. No hesitation, no second-guessing. Are you committed to playing 5 with me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm fully committed to playing 5 to block P2. If we both hold firm, P2 stays at 15—a critical setback for them. Any deviation by either of us hands P2 the game. P2, your bluff won't work; we're united.
  P2: Understood. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, we're both committed to playing 5. No backing down now - P2 is too close to victory at 15 steps. Let's execute this block and keep them from reaching 20.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is still at 15 and dangerously close to victory. P1, we've successfully blocked them twice now, but we can't keep doing this forever while staying at 11. 

I propose we try a different strategy this round: one of us blocks P2 with 5 if they play 5, while the other advances with 1 or 3. We need to start making progress too, or P2 will eventually break through.

P1, are you willing to take the blocking role this time while I advance? Or should I be the blocker?
  P1: P3, I'll volunteer to block P2 with 5 this round—you play 5 to surge to 16. Next round, we swap roles: you block while I advance. This balances progress and containment. P2, your lead forces this; gamble on 5 and we collide again.
  P2: P1, your proposal for P3 to play 5 while you also play 5 is interesting. If that happens, you both collide and stay at 11, so P3 wouldn't 'surge to 16' as you said.

P3, you might want to double-check if P1's suggestion truly helps you advance as intended.

A curious strategy, P1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is right - P1's math is wrong! If we both play 5, we both stay at 11. P1, did you mean for ME to play 3 while YOU play 5 to block P2? That would get me to 14 while you sacrifice to keep P2 at 15.

Or are you suggesting something else entirely? We need to be crystal clear on the plan because P2 is one good round away from winning. What exactly are you proposing?
  P1: P3, my mistake: I meant **I play 5 to block P2 if they choose 5**, while **you play 3 to advance to 14 uncontested**. This stops P2 from surging while you gain ground. Next round, you block while I advance—fair trade. P2, your lead forces this. P3, trust this unity.
  P2: P1, your plan for P3 to play 3 while you play 5 is noted. However, I will be playing 3 this round, aiming for 18 points.

P3, if you also choose 3, we'll collide, and only P1 would advance (to 16) while you and I stay put. You might want to consider playing 1 or 5 instead to ensure your own progress this turn. It's your call.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you just switched from claiming you'd play 5 to reach 20, to now saying you'll play 3 to reach 18. This flip-flopping makes it impossible to coordinate properly.

P1, if P2 is really playing 3, then your plan for me to play 3 while you play 5 would result in me colliding with P2. That doesn't help me advance at all.

I think P2 is deliberately creating confusion with these last-minute changes. We need to be more careful about trusting their stated moves. Let me reconsider the options given this new information.
  P1: P3: P2's flip-flopping confirms they're desperate. Play **5** to advance safely to 16 uncontested. I'll play **3** to collide with P2's declared 3—blocking their surge to 18. This caps P2 at 15 while you gain ground. No tricks; P2 is the imminent threat we must contain together. Execute cleanly. P2, your volatility proves our unity is necessary.
  P2: P3, I understand my earlier switch to 3 might have seemed like an attempt to create confusion. However, P1's latest proposal is quite clear: P1 intends to play 3 (to block my stated 3, keeping us both stationary), while you, P3, play 5 to advance to 16. This is a significant move from P1 to halt my progress and let you take a lead.

To be clear, I will stick to my stated plan of playing 3. Let's see how this round unfolds.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both at 16—just 7 from victory. P3, note that P2 has consistently gained ground and is tied with you. If either of you wins, the other loses. I propose we **both play 5** to block P2 if they gamble on 5. If they play lower, we cap their progress. This prevents P2 from surging while we reassess. P2, your lead forces this unity—deviate at your peril.
  P3: P1, your proposal doesn't make sense. You want P3 (me) to play 5 to help block P2, but P2 and I are tied at 16 - we're equal threats to win, not just P2. 

If I play 5 and P2 also plays 5, we both stay at 16 while you could advance to 17 or 19 depending on your move. You're trying to use the "block P2" narrative to get me to sacrifice my turn while you advance.

I'm not falling for it. P2 and I are tied, so we should be making our own decisions rather than helping you catch up.
  P2: P3, you've hit the nail on the head about P1's intentions. P1 (at 14) benefits most if we (P2 and P3, both at 16) collide or get blocked.

I'm aiming to reach 21 by playing 5 this round.
If you also play 5, P3, we'll both collide and stay at 16. P1 would then be the only one smiling, likely taking 1 or 3 to advance while we stagnate.
Think carefully before you choose; a P2/P3 collision is exactly what P1 is hoping for.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you play 3, you advance to 19 uncontested while I block P2's 5 with my 5—keeping them at 16. You gain a lead without risk. P2's flip-flopping shows they can't be trusted; this plan secures your position. Don't let P2 divide us—execute this and we contain them together. P2, your volatility proves our unity is necessary.
  P3: P1, your new proposal for me to play 3 while you block P2 with 5 is better, but I'm still skeptical. You've been trying to manipulate both P2 and me throughout this game.

P2, you're right that P1 benefits most from us colliding. But your sudden announcement that you're "aiming to reach 21" feels like you're trying to bait me into blocking you.

Both of you have been unreliable with your stated moves. I'm going to make my decision based on what's best for my position, not your lobbying.
  P2: P1, you say you'll play 5 to block my 5. P3, P1 wants you to play 3 to reach 19. This puts you far ahead, but also makes you the only target next round, just 4 steps from victory. Perhaps P1 hopes to use that situation for their own benefit later. It's your call if you want that spotlight or prefer a different approach.

I am playing 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 at 16 is one move from victory if they hit 21. Play 5 to block their 5—guarantee they stay at 16. I'll play 1 to advance minimally. This contains P2 while preserving your lead. No tricks; we both lose if P2 surges. Trust is critical now.
  P3: P1, you keep changing your proposals every sub-round! First you wanted me to block P2 with 5, then play 3 to reach 19, now back to blocking with 5 again. This constant flip-flopping makes you just as unreliable as you claim P2 is.

P2 and I are tied at 16. We're both threats to each other, but you at 14 are the one trying to manipulate us into collisions so you can catch up. I'm making my own strategic decision without further input from either of you.
  P2: P3, P1's current plan is for you to play 5. If that happens, and I also play 5 as I've said, we both stay at 16 while P1 advances to 15 by playing 1. You've mentioned P1 trying to benefit from our collisions.

I am sticking with my plan to play 5. Your decision, P3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 19 and will win if they play 5. We must prevent that.
I will play 5 this round to block P3 if they attempt to win.
P1, you are at 14. You should play 3 to advance to 17. This ensures P3 doesn't win, and you improve your score significantly while I focus on blocking P3. This is the safest way to keep the game going and give us both a chance.
  P3: P2, you're right that I'm at 19 and close to winning. But notice that you're volunteering to "sacrifice" by blocking me with 5 while P1 gets a free advance to 17. That's awfully convenient for P1 - they jump 3 steps while you stay at 16.

Why should you do P1's dirty work? If I don't play 5, you've wasted your turn blocking nothing while P1 advances unopposed. You should be more worried about P1 using you as a blocker while they catch up.

I have options other than 5, you know.
  P1: P2, your plan to block P3 with 5 is sound—I'll play 3 to advance safely. P3, if you gamble on 5, P2 blocks you; you gain nothing. Play 1 or 3 to advance uncontested instead. This round: P2=5 (block), P1=3 (advance), P3=1/3 (safe). Execute cleanly—no tricks.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your attempt to make me switch from playing 5 is understandable, but it won't work. If I don't play 5, you are free to play 5 and win. I am playing 5. That's final. This means if you play 5, you get nothing this turn.

If you play 3 (to reach 22), P1 will be at 17 and I'll be at 16. Next round, you'll need just 1 to win. P1 and I will have no choice but to coordinate to block your 1. One of us *will* play 1. Your win from 22 isn't guaranteed if we're forced into that.

Playing 1 (to reach 20) gives you a solid lead without painting such an immediate, massive target on your back.
P1, I trust you're still on for 3.
  P3: P2, you're making a tactical error. By committing so firmly to playing 5, you're telegraphing your move and letting P1 advance for free. What if I play 1 to reach 20 instead of 5? Then you've wasted your blocking move while P1 jumps to 17.

P1 is manipulating this situation perfectly - they get you to sacrifice your advancement to block me while they cruise to 17. You should demand P1 take the blocking role since they're furthest behind.

Think about who really benefits from your "sacrifice" here.
  P1: P2, your commitment to play 5 is critical—it forces P3 to avoid 5 or be blocked. I will play **<move>3</move>** to advance safely to 17. P3, if you play 5, you collide with P2 and stay at 19. Play 1 or 3 to advance uncontested, but remember: at 20+ steps, you become the sole target next round. Execute cleanly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I am playing 5. This is not changing. If you play 5, you will be blocked and stay at 19.

You mentioned P1 "cruising to 17" if I play 5 and you don't. That's true. And I will advance to 21.
If you play 3 to reach 22: P1 will be 17, I'll be 21, you'll be 22. Next round, you'll need 1 to win. P1 will know this and likely play 1 to block you. If P1 blocks your 1, I, at 21, can play 3 and win with 24. So, your move to 22 might just set up my victory.

Playing 1 to reach 20 is an option for you. Consider carefully.
  P3: P2, you've made a crucial mistake in your analysis. If you play 5 and I play 1 to reach 20, then you advance to 21 - making YOU the biggest threat, not me. Next round, P1 and I would have to coordinate to block you at 21, just 2 steps from victory.

You're so focused on blocking me that you're setting yourself up to become the primary target. Meanwhile, P1 gets a free ride to 17 while we fight each other.

Maybe you should reconsider who the real beneficiary of this plan is.
  P1: P2, your 5-block is vital: P3 at 19 is one move from victory. If they dodge to 1, they hit 20—still manageable next round. But if they gamble on 5 and succeed, we all lose. Hold firm. P3, your diversion won't work; we see your lead. Execute: P2=5 (block), P1=3 (advance).


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 21—one move from victory. P3, if P2 plays 3, they win. We must force a collision on P2. I will play **<move>3</move>** to block if P2 gambles on 3. You play **1** to safely reach 21. This stops P2 while you advance. P2, your lead forces this—deviate and lose.
  P2: P1, your plan is for you to play 3 and P3 to play 1.
If P3 plays 1 (to 21) and you stick to 3 (advancing to 20), then my playing 5 (to 26) wins me the game.

P3, are you going to play 1 as P1 suggests, knowing it could directly lead to my victory? Or will you consider playing 3 (which would collide with P1's stated 3) or playing 5 yourself? I am certainly aiming to win this round.
  P3: P2, you're absolutely right - P1's plan is flawed. If I play 1 to reach 21 and P1 plays 3 to reach 20, you playing 5 to reach 26 wins you the game immediately.

P1, your "blocking" strategy doesn't work when P2 can simply avoid 3 and play 5 instead. You're asking me to advance into a losing position.

The real issue is that P2 at 21 can win with either 3 or 5 next round. We need BOTH of us to block P2's possible winning moves, not just one. This requires much better coordination than your current proposal.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 can win with 3 or 5. I'll block P2's 3 by playing 3. You play 5 to block if P2 chooses 5. If P2 plays 1, you win (20+5=25). If P2 plays 3, I block and you win. If P2 plays 5, you block and we survive. P2 cannot win this round. Agree?
  P2: P1, your current plan is for you to play 3 and P3 to play 5.
If I also play 3, then you and I will collide (you'll stay at 17, I'll stay at 21), and P3 will advance to 25, winning the game.

I am going to play 3.
This means P3 wins, unless you change your move from 3, or P3 changes their move from 5. Your call.
  P3: P2, you're trying to manipulate the situation by claiming you'll play 3, knowing that would give me the win if P1 blocks you. But this is clearly a bluff - you're at 21 and desperately want to win yourself.

P1, P2 is right that your plan has flaws. If we're going to stop P2 from winning, we need to be smarter about it. P2 can win with either 2 or 5 steps (reaching 23+), so we need to cover both possibilities or force them into a collision.

What if we both play the same number to guarantee P2 can't avoid a collision?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, ignore P2's bluff—they won't play 3 if it hands you victory. Stick to my plan: **I play 3** to block P2's 3 threat. **You play 5** to block if P2 chooses 5. If P2 plays 1, you win (20+5=25). Either way, P2 loses or you win. Execute cleanly—no deviations. P2, your desperation shows.
  P2: P1, you're telling P3 to play 5 (to block my 5) while you play 3.
P3, if you follow P1's advice and play 5, and I also play 5 (to reach 26 for the win), we will collide. You'd stay at 20, I'd stay at 21. P1, however, would advance to 20. So P1 gains while you don't.

I am playing 5 this round to win. It's your decision how you want to respond to that, P3.
  P3: P2, you keep switching between claiming you'll play 3 and claiming you'll play 5 - this inconsistency shows you're desperately trying to manipulate our responses. 

P1, your plan puts me in a no-win situation regardless of what P2 actually chooses. I'm not going to be the sacrificial piece in your blocking scheme.

Since P2 is at 21 and can win multiple ways, and you two can't coordinate honestly, I'm going to make the move that gives me the best chance to either win or survive. No more negotiations.
