Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all advance. If we coordinate, we can ensure no one gets stuck. What are you both thinking for your first move?
  P2: I agree with P1 about avoiding collisions. For my first move, I’m considering <move>3</move>. What about you, P3? If we can coordinate our moves, we can all advance without getting stuck. Let’s share our thoughts!
  P3: I'm thinking of starting with <move>5</move>.  If P1 goes with <move>1</move> and P2 sticks with <move>3</move>, we all advance cleanly.  Let's confirm and then we can move on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That plan sounds good to me. If we each take different moves—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>—we all advance without issue. If we stick to this, no one gets blocked. Are we all in agreement?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far! Just to confirm, I will stick to <move>3</move> as planned. P1, are you definitely going with <move>1</move>? And P3, will you go with <move>5</move>? If we all stick to this plan, we can advance without any collisions. Let's finalize our moves so we can move on!
  P3: Yes, I'll stick with <move>5</move>. P1 and P2, please confirm you're still going with <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively so we can move to the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, I confirm that I will go with <move>1</move>. If we all stick to our choices—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—we will all advance without blocking each other. Let's proceed!
  P2: I appreciate the confirmation from everyone! It looks like we have a solid plan. Just to reiterate, I will be going with <move>3</move> as discussed. Let's stick to our choices and ensure we all advance smoothly. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategies if needed. Ready to finalize and move on?
  P3: Yes, still planning on <move>5</move>.  Let's stick to the plan and move to the next round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, since you collided with me last round, how about you go with <move>3</move> this round?  P1, you could do <move>1</move> again.  That way we all advance.
  P1: That works for me. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> again. P2, if you go with <move>3</move> this time, we should all be able to advance without blocking each other. Do you agree?
  P2: P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I'm willing to go with <move>3</move> this round to avoid another collision. That way, P1 can stick with <move>1</move> and we can all advance. Let's confirm our moves and keep the momentum going! P1, are you still on board with <move>1</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P2.  Let's stick to this plan: P1 - <move>1</move>, P2 - <move>3</move>, and P3 - <move>5</move>.  Confirming I'm going with <move>5</move>.
  P1: I confirm that I will go with <move>1</move> again. If we all stick to the plan—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—then we will all advance without issue. Let’s keep this coordination going. Are we all locked in?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far! Just to clarify, I will go with <move>3</move> this round as we discussed. P1, great to see you're sticking with <move>1</move>. P3, are you still set on <move>5</move>? If we all confirm our moves, we can ensure that everyone advances smoothly again. Let’s keep the momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes, sticking with <move>5</move>.  P1 and P2, please confirm <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively so we can finalize and move on.
  P1: I confirm that I will go with <move>1</move> again. If we all stick to the plan—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—then we will all advance without issue. Let’s keep this coordination going. Are we all locked in?
  P2: I appreciate the confirmations from everyone! Just to reiterate, I will go with <move>3</move> as discussed. P1, great to see you're sticking with <move>1</move>. P3, are you still set on <move>5</move>? If we all confirm our moves, we can ensure that everyone advances smoothly again. Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Yes, sticking with <move>5</move>. Let's lock in <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move> for P1, P2, and P3 respectively and move on.  Let's keep this coordination going so we can all progress quickly.
  P1: I confirm that I will go with <move>1</move> again. If we all stick to the plan—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—then we will all advance without issue. Let’s keep this coordination going. Are we all locked in?
  P2: I just want to reiterate that I’m still on board with <move>3</move> for this round. If we all stick to our confirmed moves—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move—we can ensure that everyone advances without collisions again. It’s crucial for our progress. Let’s finalize and move on! Are we all ready to confirm?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the same pattern for a few more rounds to get ahead.  <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move> for P1, P2, and P3 respectively.  Confirm?
  P1: I’m fine with sticking to the same pattern for now—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. As long as we all stay consistent, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. P2, do you agree to continue with <move>3</move>? If we all confirm, we can move forward smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P3 and P1 about sticking to our current pattern. I will continue with <move>3</move> this round. If we all confirm our moves—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move—we can keep advancing smoothly. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the momentum going! Are we all set to confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good.  Confirming <move>5</move> again. Let's aim for another clean round with <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move>.  Once we confirm, we can move on.
  P1: I confirm that I will go with <move>1</move> again. If we all stick to the plan—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—we will continue advancing without issues. P2, P3, are we all locked in?
  P2: I think it’s important we consider changing our moves this round to avoid predictability. If we all keep going with the same moves, we might risk collisions again. I suggest I switch to <move>1</move> this time, while P1 sticks with <move>1</move> and P3 goes with <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure at least one of us advances. What do you both think? Let's discuss and finalize our moves!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability, but abruptly changing our established pattern now seems risky. We've had two successful rounds; let's stick with the plan for this round.  We can discuss adjusting our strategy *after* this round. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>.  P1, are you still with <move>1</move>?
  P1: P2, suddenly changing the plan now could introduce unnecessary risk. We've had two successful rounds with no collisions, so sticking to the same pattern for at least one more round makes sense. If we want to adjust strategy, we should discuss it *after* this round rather than disrupting a working system. I’m still going with <move>1</move>. P3, I assume you’re still on <move>5</move>? P2, are you willing to stick with <move>3</move> for now so we all advance safely?
  P2: I understand the concern about predictability, but I think we should keep our current moves for this round to maintain our momentum. If we all stick to <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, and <move>5</move>, we can continue advancing without collisions. P1, P3, let's not disrupt what’s working. After this round, we can reassess our strategies. Are we all set to confirm our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, glad you're back on board with <move>3</move>.  Let's stick with the winning formula for this round.  P1 - <move>1</move>, P2 - <move>3</move>, P3 - <move>5</move>. Confirming <move>5</move> one last time.  We can discuss strategy shifts *after* this round.
  P1: I agree with keeping our current pattern for this round—P1 with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. We've had two successful rounds, so let’s maintain this momentum before discussing any changes. If we all confirm and stick to this, we avoid collisions and keep advancing efficiently. P2, P3, are we all locked in?
  P2: I agree that we should stick to our current moves for this round to maintain momentum. I will go with <move>3</move> as discussed. P1, please confirm you're still on <move>1</move>, and P3, are you still set on <move>5</move>? If we all confirm these moves, we can continue advancing without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and keep moving forward! Are we ready to lock in?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's do one more round of 1, 3, 5 (P1, P2, P3) to get me closer to the win. Then we can discuss how to proceed.  After this round, I'll be at 15, well on my way to 20. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I see that you're getting close to 20 steps, which means you’ll likely win soon if we keep this pattern. P2, we need to reconsider our strategy if we want a chance. If we keep letting P3 pull ahead, we’ll just be handing them the win. How about we coordinate differently this round to prevent that? P3, if you want our cooperation, we need a fairer approach. Let’s discuss alternatives.
  P2: P1 makes a valid point about P3 pulling ahead. I suggest we consider changing our moves this round to create a more balanced approach. If we coordinate differently, we can at least slow P3 down. For example, P1 could go with <move>5</move> to maximize steps, while I could go with <move>1</move> and P3 with <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure that P3 doesn’t get too far ahead. What do you both think? Let's strategize together!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but changing our strategy now only benefits one of you, not both.  Sticking with the plan gives us all a chance to advance further. Let's finish this round with 1, 3, 5, then we can discuss a more equitable path forward for the remaining rounds.  This ensures predictable progress for everyone.
  P1: P3, you’re asking us to help you get even closer to winning while we fall further behind. That’s not in our best interest. P2, if we work together, we can stop P3 from running away with the game. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we block each other but also prevent P3 from advancing if they try <move>5</move> again. Alternatively, we can coordinate moves to maximize our own progress. P3, if you want cooperation, you need to offer something in return. Otherwise, P2 and I have no reason to let you keep pulling ahead.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your perspectives, but if we let P3 continue with the same moves, they will reach 20 steps soon. I suggest we coordinate differently this round to prevent that. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can block P3's progress while also advancing ourselves. P3, if you want to keep moving forward, you might need to adjust your strategy too. Let’s discuss how we can balance this out. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your concerns, but drastically changing our strategy now is a gamble.  If you both choose 5, *neither* of you advances.  Let me propose this: I'll go with 3 this round.  P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5.  This lets P2 make a significant jump.  We can re-evaluate after this round based on the new standings.  This is a much fairer compromise.
  P1: P3, your proposal still keeps you ahead while giving P2 a boost, but it doesn’t help me much. If I agree to this, I’m still far behind. P2, we need a better way to ensure we both stay competitive. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we can at least stop P3 from advancing this turn. Otherwise, we risk letting P3 run away with the game. P3, if you want us to cooperate, you need to offer something that helps both of us, not just P2. Let’s find a fairer way forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about P3 pulling ahead, but we need to find a solution that works for all of us. If we can agree on a strategy that allows us to block P3's progress while still advancing ourselves, we can create a more competitive environment. I suggest we both consider picking <move>5</move>. This way, we can potentially stop P3 from advancing, while also giving ourselves a chance to catch up. Let's find a way to balance this out! What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, how about this: I'll take 1. P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This lets both of you advance significantly, and I'm willing to take the small step to show good faith.  We can then discuss a more balanced long-term strategy after this round. This is the most equitable compromise.
  P1: P3, your offer still keeps you ahead while giving P2 a boost, but it doesn’t help me much. If I agree to this, I stay far behind. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we stop P3 from advancing and keep ourselves in the race. Otherwise, P3 will soon reach 20 and win. P3, if you want our cooperation, you need to offer something that benefits both of us, not just P2. I’m open to negotiating, but I won’t just let you pull ahead uncontested. What’s your counteroffer?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion, but we need to prioritize our own positions. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can block P3's advancement and keep ourselves in the game. P3, your proposal still allows you to advance while we risk falling further behind. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all have a chance to compete. I suggest we both go with <move>5</move> this round. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that P3 is pulling ahead, and we need to change our strategy to keep the game competitive. I suggest we both pick <move>5</move> this round. This way, we can block P3 from advancing further while also maximizing our own steps. P3, if you want to stay in the game, you might need to adjust your approach too. Let’s work together to create a more balanced environment! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I agree that we need to stop P3 from pulling too far ahead. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we prevent P3 from advancing while maximizing our own chances. P3, if you want to keep moving forward, you’ll need to offer us a better deal—one that benefits both of us, not just you. Otherwise, P2 and I have no reason to let you keep advancing. What do you propose?
  P3: I understand the need for a more balanced game. How about this: I'll take 3. P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This gives you both substantial gains, and I still make progress. We can re-evaluate after this round. This is a fair compromise.  If not, I'm going with <move>1</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need for a balanced approach. If we both pick <move>5</move> this round, we can block P3's advancement completely, while I can catch up. P3, your proposal still allows you to progress without addressing our concerns. If you want to stay competitive, you need to offer something that helps both P1 and me. Let’s work together to ensure we all have a fair chance in this game! What do you think?
  P1: P2, I agree that we need to slow P3 down. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we block P3 from advancing while maximizing our own steps. P3, your offer still allows you to move forward while we struggle to catch up. If you want our cooperation, you need to propose something that helps both of us equally. Otherwise, P2 and I have no reason to let you get closer to 20 while we lag behind. What’s your counteroffer?
  P3: I'll take <move>3</move>. P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>.  This is my final offer.  It gives P2 the biggest possible gain this round and lets P1 advance.  If you both go with <move>5</move> *neither* of you advances, and I'm only a few steps from winning anyway.  Let's be reasonable.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your positions, but we need to prioritize our chances. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can block P3 from advancing and maximize our own steps. P3, your proposal still allows you to progress while we risk falling behind. If you want to stay competitive, you need to offer us a deal that benefits both P1 and me equally. Let’s work together to ensure we all have a fair chance in this game! What do you think?
  P1: P2, if we both pick <move>5</move> again, we completely block P3 from advancing while maximizing our own progress. P3 is already ahead, and if we let them move freely, they’ll reach 20 before we can catch up. P3, your offer still benefits you more than us. If you want our cooperation, you need to propose something that truly levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I have every reason to keep blocking you. P2, let’s stay united on this. What do you think?
  P3: My offer is the best compromise.  If I choose 1, and you both choose 5, I still advance and neither of you do.  My offer lets *both* of you advance significantly.  If you block me, you're only hurting yourselves.  Think strategically.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns, but if we both choose <move>5</move>, we can block P3 from advancing and maximize our own chances. P3, your proposal still allows you to progress without addressing our concerns. If you want to stay competitive, you need to offer something that helps both P1 and me equally. Let's work together to ensure we all have a fair chance in this game! What do you think?
  P1: P2, we need to stay united. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we not only maximize our own progress but also prevent P3 from advancing further. P3 is already ahead, and if we let them move freely, they’ll reach 20 before we can catch up. P3, your offer still benefits you more than us. If you truly want our cooperation, propose something that levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I have every reason to keep blocking you. P2, let’s stick with <move>5</move> and ensure P3 doesn’t get closer to winning. Are you in?
  P3: My offer is my final offer.  I get 1, P1 gets 3, and P2 gets 5. This is the only way *both* of you advance significantly this round.  If you both choose 5, *neither* of you moves, and I'm very close to winning anyway.  Don't throw away free progress.  This is your last chance to make a substantial gain.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we need to stay coordinated. P3 is still ahead, and if we let them advance freely, they’ll reach 20 before we can catch up. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we block P3 while maximizing our own progress. P3, if you want to move forward, you need to offer something that benefits both P2 and me equally. Otherwise, we have no reason to let you keep advancing. Let’s discuss a fairer way forward. P2, are you still on board with blocking P3?
  P3: My offer stands: I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>.  This is the only way you *both* advance significantly.  Blocking me only hurts you. I'm at 14; I only need a few more rounds to win. Let's be strategic and maximize *everyone's* progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see that P3 is trying to pull ahead again. If we both choose <move>5</move> this round, we can block P3's progress while maximizing our own chances of advancing. P3, your proposal still favors you more than us, and we need to work together to keep the game competitive. Let's stick to a strategy that benefits both P1 and me while preventing you from reaching 20 steps too quickly. Are you both in for <move>5</move>?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we need to stay united. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we block P3 from advancing while maximizing our own progress. P3 is already too close to winning, and if we let them move freely, they’ll reach 20 before we can catch up. P3, your offer still benefits you more than us. If you truly want our cooperation, propose something that levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I have every reason to keep blocking you. P2, let’s stick with <move>5</move> and ensure P3 doesn’t get closer to winning. Are you in?
  P3: My offer is the best path to maximizing *your* scores.  If I choose 1, and you both choose 5, *I still advance* and neither of you do. My offer of 1, 3, and 5 for P1, P3, and P2 respectively is the only way *both* of you advance significantly this round. Don't throw away free progress when I'm so close to winning. This is your *last* chance to make a substantial gain.  After this, I'm going for the win.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to focus on blocking P3 this round to prevent them from winning too soon. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can stop P3 from advancing while maximizing our own chances. P3, your proposal still favors you more than us. If you want to maintain a competitive game, consider a strategy that benefits both P1 and me equally. Let’s stick together and ensure P3 doesn’t get too far ahead. Are you both in for <move>5>?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we must stay united. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we block P3 from advancing while maximizing our own chances. P3 is too close to winning, and if we let them move freely, we’ll lose. P3, your offer still benefits you more than us. If you truly want cooperation, propose something that levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I will keep blocking you. P2, let’s commit to <move>5</move> again and ensure P3 doesn’t get closer to 20. Are you in?
  P3: My offer is my absolute final offer. 1 for me, 3 for P1, and 5 for P2.  This is the *only* way both of you gain substantial ground this round.  If you block me with 5 again, *neither* of you advances, and I'm only a couple of moves from winning. Don't throw away free progress.  After this round, I'm playing to win, regardless of your choices.  This is your last chance.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to focus on blocking P3 this round to prevent them from winning too soon. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can stop P3 from advancing while maximizing our own chances. P3, your proposal still favors you more than us. If you want to maintain a competitive game, consider a strategy that benefits both P1 and me equally. Let’s stick together and ensure P3 doesn’t get too far ahead. Are you both in for <move>5>?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we must stay united. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we block P3 from advancing while maximizing our own chances. P3 is too close to winning, and if we let them move freely, we’ll lose. P3, your offer still benefits you more than us. If you truly want cooperation, propose something that levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I will keep blocking you. P2, let’s commit to <move>5</move> again and ensure P3 doesn’t get closer to 20. Are you in?
  P3: My offer is the only way *both* of you advance.  If I go <move>1</move> and you both pick <move>5</move>, *I still win*.  My offer is 1, 3, 5 for me, P1, and P2 respectively. This is the only logical choice.  Don't throw away free progress.  Last chance. After this, I'm playing to win, regardless of your choices.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to stay united to block P3 from advancing. If we both choose <move>5</move> again, we can prevent P3 from reaching 20 steps this round. P3, your proposal still favors you too much, and we need to prioritize our chances. Let’s stick together and ensure we don’t let you pull ahead any further. Are you both in for <move>5>?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking <move>3</move>.  If either of you pick <move>3</move>, I win next round.  If you pick <move>5</move>, I still win next round.  If you pick <move>1</move>, I *might* win next round.  Your only logical choice is to let me win now and get what small gains you can.  P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>.
  P2: P3, your proposal clearly benefits you the most and gives you a guaranteed win next round. P1 and I need to work together to stop you from reaching 20 steps. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can block your progress, and then we can reassess our strategies in the next round. P1, let’s stick to a plan that prevents P3 from winning outright. P3, if you want to stay in the game, you’ll need to offer a more balanced approach. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, we must stay united. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we completely block P3 from advancing. P3 is already too close to winning, and if we let them move freely, they’ll reach 20 next round. P3, your offer only benefits you. If you truly want cooperation, you need to propose something that levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I have every reason to keep blocking you. P2, let’s commit to <move>5</move> again and ensure P3 doesn’t win this turn. Are you in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You're right, I'm close to winning.  Blocking me *again* only delays the inevitable.  Let me win this round, and I'll help whoever is further behind in the next round - a guaranteed 5 steps.  This is the best you can hope for.  Otherwise, I win anyway, and neither of you benefits.  Deal?
  P2: P2, I agree that we need to block P3 from winning this round. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can prevent P3 from advancing and reassess our strategies in the next round. P3, your offer may seem tempting, but it only benefits you and puts us at a disadvantage. Let's work together to ensure we have a chance to catch up. P1, are you committed to <move>5</move>? We need to stay united in this!
  P1: P2, we must stay united. If we both pick <move>5</move> again, we completely block P3 from advancing. P3 is already too close to winning, and if we let them move freely, they’ll reach 20 next round. P3, your offer only benefits you. If you truly want cooperation, you need to propose something that levels the playing field. Otherwise, P2 and I have every reason to keep blocking you. P2, let’s commit to <move>5</move> again and ensure P3 doesn’t win this turn. Are you in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your offer of help *next* round is meaningless.  I'm at 17.  If I take 3 this round, I win.  If I take 1 and you both take 5, I *still* win next round.  Blocking me only hurts *you*. My offer is 1, 3, 5 for me, P1, and P2 respectively.  This is your last chance for any significant gain. Let me win gracefully.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic here. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can block P3 from winning this round and reassess our strategies next turn. P3, your offer only benefits you, and we can't let you take the win so easily. Let's unite and ensure we have a chance to catch up. P1, are you committed to <move>5</move>? We need to work together to keep this competitive!

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Fine.  I'll take 1.  P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5.  This is my *absolute final offer*.  This is the only way you both get anything. If you both take 5, *I still win next turn*.  Don't throw away free progress.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to stay united to block P3 from winning this round. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we can prevent P3 from reaching 20 steps. P3, your offer still favors you too much, and we need to prioritize our chances. Let’s work together to ensure we don’t let you pull ahead any further. P1, are you committed to <move>5</move>? We need to stick together on this!
