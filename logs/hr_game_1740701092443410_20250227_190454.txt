Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. I'll pick either 1 or 3 this round. You two can coordinate accordingly. Deal?
  P1: "P2, I agree on avoiding collisions. P3, what’s your plan? Let’s coordinate to ensure no one picks the same number. I’m considering 1 or 5 this round. Thoughts?"
  P3: I'm open to coordination. Since P1 is considering 1 or 5 and P2 mentioned 1 or 3, I'll consider 5 to avoid collision, but let's finalize our choices to ensure no overlaps. What's the preferred distribution?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let's lock it in clearly: I'll take 3. P1, you can take 1, and P3, you take 5. Agreed?
  P1: "P2 and P3, the proposed distribution sounds fair. I’ll stick with 1 as agreed. Let’s all commit to avoid collisions and advance smoothly. If we stick to this coordination, we can all progress without setbacks. Ready to move forward?"
  P3: I agree with the proposed distribution. To confirm, the plan is: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should allow all of us to advance without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Shall we proceed to the move phase?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good coordination last round! To keep things fair and smooth again, let's rotate our picks this round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? Does that work for everyone?
  P3: Rotating picks sounds reasonable, but we should consider the overall progress. Since I'm currently in the lead, I might want to maintain my advantage. P2's proposal puts you at 4 steps, P2 at 8, and me at 6. Let's discuss if this rotation truly keeps things "fair and smooth" for all, or if we should adjust to reflect the current standings.
  P1: P2 and P3, rotating picks seems fair, but let’s also consider strategy. If P3 is in the lead, perhaps we should adjust to balance progress. P2, taking 5 would give you a significant lead. Maybe P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1 to keep things closer. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fair enough, P1. I'm open to your suggestion. To keep things balanced, I'm okay taking 1 this round if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for this round. P1 suggested I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This seems reasonable to maintain balance. P2, are you committed to taking 1 as discussed? P1, you're set on 5? I'm ready to take 3 if we all agree on this distribution.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m committed to taking 5 as discussed. P2, are you still set on taking 1? P3, are you confirmed for 3? Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, I'm committed to taking 1 this round as we've discussed. Let's lock this in clearly: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Ready to move forward!
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed distribution for this round to avoid any last-minute changes. As discussed, I'll take 3, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 1. This should maintain balance and prevent collisions. Are we all still on board with this plan before we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure clarity and avoid any confusion, let’s confirm once more: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. No deviations from this plan to prevent collisions and maintain balance. If we all stick to this, we’ll progress smoothly. Ready to move to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All set on my end. Let's stick to the agreed plan and move forward.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves as agreed: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures balance and avoids collisions. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. Any deviation will disrupt the balance and potentially harm all our progress. Let's proceed with the agreed moves and maintain a smooth game.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Sticking to this plan ensures no collisions and maintains balance. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase with full commitment to the agreed moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I suggest we continue to balance our progress. P1, you're behind, so taking 5 might be a good option for you. P2, taking 1 would keep you in the game without leapfrogging others. I'll consider taking 3 to maintain a steady lead without pulling too far ahead. Thoughts on this distribution?
  P2: P3, your suggestion seems reasonable, but let's also consider rotating positions to keep the coordination fair. Since I took 1 last round, perhaps this time I could take 5, P1 could take 3, and you (P3) could take 1. This rotation would still allow everyone to move forward without collisions and maintain competitive balance. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, rotating positions sounds fair, but let’s consider strategy. P3, you’re in the lead, so taking 1 might help balance progress. P2, taking 3 would keep you competitive, and I’ll take 5 to catch up. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a closer race. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's balance progress. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This distribution allows everyone to advance without collisions and maintains a competitive balance, considering the current standings. Thoughts?
  P2: Agreed, P3. Your suggested distribution (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) works well for balance and fairness. I'm comfortable with this plan. P1, do you also agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the proposed distribution: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps the race competitive. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain balance and avoid setbacks. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed distribution for this round to ensure clarity: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This maintains balance and prevents collisions. Are we all committed to this plan to proceed smoothly to the move phase?
  P2: I'm fully committed to the agreed distribution: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's all stick to this plan and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the proposed distribution: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps the race competitive. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain balance and avoid setbacks. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. To confirm, we agreed on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. This ensures balance and avoids collisions. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. If we're all set, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: All set here. Let's keep our word and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s confirm our agreed moves one final time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Sticking to this plan ensures no collisions and maintains balance. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase with full commitment to the agreed moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great coordination so far! To keep things balanced and smooth, let's rotate again. How about I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This rotation would still prevent collisions and keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: Considering the current standings, P2's suggestion might not be the best for balance. P1 is behind, and taking 1 would put them further back. How about P1 takes 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to maintain pace, and I take 3 to keep a steady lead? This distribution considers the current progress and aims to keep the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3’s suggestion. Taking 5 would help me catch up, while P2 takes 1 to maintain balance, and P3 takes 3 to keep a steady lead. This distribution considers our current progress and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair advancement. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your points and agree that P1 taking 5 makes sense to keep the game competitive. I'm comfortable taking 1 this round, with P3 taking 3. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for Round 4. As discussed, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This ensures balance and avoids collisions. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. If we're all set, we can proceed to the move phase, maintaining a competitive and fair game.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the proposed distribution: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain balance and avoid setbacks. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All set here. Let's stick to our agreed moves and proceed smoothly.
  P3: Let's review our agreed plan for Round 4 to ensure we're on the same page: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This plan maintains balance and prevents collisions. Are we all still committed to this distribution before we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: "P2 and P3, I’m committed to taking 5 as agreed. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase with full commitment to the agreed moves. Ready?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed distribution for this round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's trust each other and proceed smoothly.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This ensures balance and avoids collisions. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. If we're all set, let's proceed to the move phase, maintaining a competitive and fair game.
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s confirm one final time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Sticking to this plan ensures no collisions and maintains balance. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase with full commitment to the agreed moves. Ready?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're close to winning, so naturally you'll want to pick 5. P3, you're also ahead of me. To keep things competitive and fair, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. This way, we all advance without collision, and the game stays interesting. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our current standings, P2's suggestion doesn't seem to balance progress fairly. I propose P1 takes 5 to secure their lead, I take 3 to maintain my position, and P2 takes 1 to stay in the game. This ensures competitive balance and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m close to winning, but fairness and balance are key. P3’s suggestion makes sense: I take 5 to secure my lead, P3 takes 3 to maintain position, and P2 takes 1 to stay competitive. This avoids collisions and keeps the game close. Let’s stick to this plan for a smooth and fair round. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're already at 16 steps. If you take 5 now, you'll win outright at 21. P3, letting P1 take 5 guarantees their victory and ends the game instantly. I suggest we reconsider carefully. Perhaps P3 should take 5 this round to close the gap, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game alive and competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P2's new suggestion, taking 1 would set me back. I think P3 taking 5 could be a good move to close the gap with P1, but it also risks P1 winning if they take a different step. Let's weigh our options carefully to ensure a competitive game. What are the thoughts on maintaining the initial plan or adjusting to keep the game alive?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand P2’s concern about me winning outright, but fairness and avoiding collisions should remain our priority. To keep the game competitive, I propose I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This allows P3 to close the gap, keeps P2 in the game, and prevents me from winning immediately. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain balance and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your new proposal (P1:3, P3:5, P2:1) sounds fair and reasonable. I'm comfortable with this distribution as it maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. P3, do you agree to this adjusted plan? Let's finalize clearly to avoid collisions and proceed smoothly.
  P3: I agree with P1's new proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This distribution maintains balance, keeps the game competitive, and allows me to close the gap with P1. It's a fair adjustment to ensure an exciting continuation. Let's confirm this plan to proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the adjusted plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures balance, keeps the game competitive, and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain fairness and prevent any disruptions. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All set here. Let's stick to our agreed moves (P1:3, P3:5, P2:1) and proceed smoothly.
  P3: Let's reaffirm our agreed plan for Round 5: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. I expect everyone to stick to this plan to ensure a smooth and fair continuation. Are we all still committed to this distribution before proceeding to the move phase?
  P1: "P2 and P3, to ensure clarity and commitment, let’s confirm once more: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This plan maintains balance, keeps the game competitive, and avoids collisions. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase with full commitment to the agreed moves. Ready?"


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I suggest we focus on strategic advancement. P1 is close to winning, so they might aim to secure their lead. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5 to close the gap, and P2 takes 3 to stay competitive. This distribution considers our progress and aims to keep the game exciting. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense strategically. However, given that I'm significantly behind, I'm open to any arrangement that helps me catch up a bit. P1, you're very close to winning—perhaps you could take 1 to keep things interesting. I'm fine with taking either 3 or 5 if we can agree clearly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I propose: I take 1 to stay just below 21, P3 takes 5 to close the gap, and P2 takes 3 to stay in the race. This ensures balance and prolongs the game for a more exciting finish. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain fairness and avoid disruptions. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's adjust the plan to give P2 a better chance. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1? This way, P2 can catch up, and the game remains competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I appreciate you looking out for me. Your adjusted suggestion (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1) sounds fair and helps keep the game competitive. I'm on board with this plan. P1, are you comfortable taking 1 this round to keep things balanced?
  P1: P2 and P3, to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I’ll take 1 this round. P3, taking 3 would maintain your position, and P2, taking 5 helps you catch up. This ensures balance and prolongs the game for a more exciting finish. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain fairness. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6. To confirm, the proposed distribution is P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. Is everyone still committed to this distribution before proceeding to the move phase?
  P2: I'm fully committed to this distribution: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's trust each other, avoid collisions, and keep the game exciting. Ready to proceed!
  P1: P2 and P3, I’ll stick to taking 1 this round to keep the game balanced. P2, taking 5 helps you catch up, and P3, taking 3 maintains your position. Let’s commit to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure a competitive finish. Ready to proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. If we're all set, let's proceed to the move phase. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let's proceed with full commitment to the agreed moves.
  P2: All set here. Let's stick to our agreed moves and proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure clarity and avoid last-minute changes, let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This plan maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. Any deviation would disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s proceed to the move phase with full commitment to the agreed moves. Ready?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 20 steps, so taking 1 would win me the game. To keep it competitive, I propose: I take 1 to secure the win, P3 takes 5 to close the gap, and P2 takes 3 to stay in the race. This ensures a fair conclusion while allowing everyone to advance strategically. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and end the game smoothly. Agreed?
  P2: P1, if you take 1, you win outright. P3, we must coordinate carefully to prevent an automatic win. P3, if you take 1 to block P1, I'll take 5 to catch up. P1, consider taking 3 or 5 to keep things sporting and interesting. Thoughts?
  P3: Considering P1's lead, I suggest a strategic move. P1, taking 1 wins the game outright, so perhaps you should consider taking 3 or 5 to keep it competitive. P2, taking 5 could help you catch up. I'll take 1 to block P1's immediate win and force a more competitive conclusion. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concern about me winning outright, but let’s focus on fairness and avoiding collisions. If I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1, it keeps the game competitive and prevents immediate victory. This ensures balance and allows everyone to advance strategically. Let’s stick to this plan for a smooth and fair conclusion. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your suggestion is fair. I'm comfortable taking 1 this round, while you take 3 and P3 takes 5. P3, are you on board with this distribution? Let's finalize clearly to avoid collisions and keep the game interesting.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This distribution maintains balance and keeps the game competitive. However, considering my current position, I might reconsider to ensure I don't fall behind. Let's weigh our options carefully to ensure a fair and exciting conclusion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose: I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive, prevents immediate victory, and allows everyone to advance strategically. Let’s commit to this plan for a smooth and fair conclusion. Agreed?
  P2: P3, let's be clear here—if P1 takes 1, they instantly win. You mentioned earlier you'd take 1 to block that, and I support that idea. I'll stick to taking 5 to close the gap. P1, consider taking 3 or 5 to keep things interesting. Let's finalize clearly: P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. Deal?
  P3: Let's finalize the plan. To block P1's immediate win and keep the game competitive, I suggest: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This distribution prevents an outright win, allows P2 to catch up, and keeps the game exciting. Are we all on board with this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, I propose: I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive, prevents immediate victory, and allows everyone to advance strategically. Let’s commit to this plan for a smooth and fair conclusion. Agreed?
  P2: P1, you've repeatedly proposed taking 3, and I trust you'll stick to that. P3, if you take 5 and I take 1, we all advance smoothly without collisions, keeping the game competitive. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Ready to move forward?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves. I suggest I take 1 to block P1's win, P2 takes 5 to catch up, and P1 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive and prevents an outright win. Are we all committed to this plan to proceed smoothly?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's focus on strategic advancement. Given the current standings, I propose P1 takes 1 to win, P2 takes 3 to maintain position, and I take 5 to close the gap. This ensures a competitive conclusion while allowing everyone to advance strategically. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I’m at 20 steps, so taking 1 would secure my win. However, to keep the game competitive and fair, I propose: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows everyone to advance strategically while ensuring a smooth conclusion. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and end the game fairly. Agreed?
  P2: P1, if you take 1 you win outright—so it's understandable you'll go for it. P3, we must carefully coordinate to prevent an uncontested win. If you take 1 to block P1, I'll take 3 to reach 21. This gives us both a chance. Let's finalize clearly: P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P1, perhaps reconsider your move to keep things interesting?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's reconsider our strategy. Since I'm behind, taking 5 would be beneficial. How about P1 takes 1 to win, I take 5 to close the gap, and P2 takes 3 to maintain position? This ensures a competitive conclusion. Alternatively, if P1 takes 3 or 5, I could take 1 to block the win, and P2 takes 5 to catch up. Let's weigh our options carefully for a fair and exciting end.
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure a fair and competitive conclusion, I propose: I take 1 to secure the win, P2 takes 3 to reach 21, and P3 takes 5 to close the gap. This allows everyone to advance strategically while avoiding collisions. Let’s commit to this plan for a smooth and balanced end to the game. Agreed?
  P2: P1, if you take 1, you'll win outright—but if I also reach 21 by taking 3, we'll tie and share the victory. P3, taking 5 gets you closer but won't let you reach 21 yet. Let's avoid collisions and finalize: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Considering the current standings, I suggest P1 takes 1 to win, P2 takes 3 to tie, and I take 5 to close the gap. This ensures a competitive conclusion. However, if P1 takes 3 or 5, I could take 1 to block the win, and P2 takes 5 to catch up. Let's weigh our options carefully for a fair and exciting end. What are your thoughts on this distribution?
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure a fair and competitive conclusion, I propose: I take 1 to secure the win, P2 takes 3 to reach 21, and P3 takes 5 to close the gap. This allows everyone to advance strategically while avoiding collisions. Let’s commit to this plan for a smooth and balanced end to the game. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I'm committed to taking 3 and reaching 21. If you take 1, we both share the victory. P3, you taking 5 helps you close the gap. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves. I suggest I take 5 to close the gap, P2 takes 3 to reach 21, and P1 takes 1 to win. Alternatively, if P1 takes 3 or 5, I could take 1 to block the win, and P2 takes 5 to catch up. However, considering the standings, P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3 seems the most likely outcome for a shared victory. Let's proceed with this plan for a competitive conclusion.
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure a fair and competitive conclusion, I propose: I take 1 to secure the win, P2 takes 3 to reach 21, and P3 takes 5 to close the gap. This allows everyone to advance strategically while avoiding collisions. Let’s commit to this plan for a smooth and balanced end to the game. Agreed?
  P2: P1, if you take 1 and I take 3, we both reach 21 and share the victory. P3, taking 5 helps you close the gap. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Agreed?
