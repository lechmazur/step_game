Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's consider our options carefully. If we all pick different moves, we can all advance. However, if we coordinate, we might be able to maximize our steps. I suggest we think about what moves we might choose and see if we can come to an agreement. What do you both have in mind?
  P2: I agree, coordination benefits all of us early on. To avoid collision, how about we simply split the moves this round? I'll volunteer to take 3 steps. P1 and P3, you two can decide between 1 and 5. Does that sound fair?
  P1: Okay, P2's suggestion sounds like a good starting point for coordination. It allows everyone to potentially advance this turn.

I'm happy with P2 taking 3. For myself and P3, how about P3 chooses first between 1 and 5, and I'll take the remaining number? This way we can ensure we don't collide.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement so far. Since P2 is taking 3 steps, I will choose 1 step to avoid any collision. P1, that leaves you with 5 steps. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Does that work for you? Let’s finalize our choices so we can move on!
  P2: Sounds perfect to me. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: Yes, that works perfectly for me. P3 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I take 5 ensures we all get a good start without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great! I'm glad we're all on the same page. Just to confirm our choices: I will take 1 step, P2 will take 3 steps, and P1 will take 5 steps. This way, we ensure no collisions and all advance. Let's lock in our moves and prepare for the next phase! If everyone agrees, we can proceed. What do you both think?
  P2: All set here. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, I'm ready to proceed with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's move to the next phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we've all agreed on our moves for this round. Just to recap, I will take 1 step, P2 will take 3 steps, and P1 will take 5 steps. This strategy should help us all advance without any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and see how to proceed in the next turn. If everyone is ready, let's finalize our choices and move on!
  P2: 
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon moves. Let's move to the next phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 1 didn't go as planned for P3 and me, colliding on 5 while P2 advanced. P3, you said you would take 1. What led to you choosing 5 instead? We need to figure out how to proceed this round to avoid more collisions and help P3 and I catch up to P2.
  P2: I kept my word and chose 3 as agreed, and it paid off. P3, care to explain why you switched to 5? Trust is important if we're going to coordinate effectively. Let's clarify intentions openly this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the confusion regarding my move in Round 1. I miscalculated and thought I could safely choose 5. This round, I want to ensure we avoid collisions again. To help P1 and myself catch up, I propose we stick to the original plan of splitting moves. P1, how about you take 1 step this time, and I'll take 3? P2, you can take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate the proposal to avoid collisions. However, P1 taking only 1 step while P2 takes 5 doesn't help me catch up from 0. It puts me further behind. Given what happened last round, trust is low. I need to make up ground. How about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This helps me advance significantly.
  P2: P1, your proposal makes sense to me. I'm comfortable taking 3 again this round. P3, considering last round's confusion, are you willing to commit clearly this time to taking 1 step? Let's confirm openly to rebuild trust and move forward.
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, and I appreciate your willingness to trust me with taking 1 step. I will commit to that this round. P2, if you take 3 steps again, that leaves P1 with 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. I believe this strategy will help rebuild trust and allow us to move forward effectively. Let's finalize our choices clearly to avoid any misunderstandings this time. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a clear plan that works for me. P3 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and I will take 5. Let's proceed with these moves this round to ensure we all advance. Ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: Great, I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. P3, please confirm clearly once more that you're choosing 1 step, so we all move forward without collisions this round.
  P3: I confirm that I will take 1 step this round. P2, you’re taking 3 steps, and P1 will take 5 steps. This plan should allow us all to advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and move forward confidently. I believe this will help rebuild trust and put us in a better position for the next rounds. Are we all agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan sounds clear and agreed upon by everyone: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me advance. I'm ready to proceed with these moves. Let's go to the next phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed as agreed. Let's lock in our moves and move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our plan. Just to confirm one last time: I will take 1 step, P2 will take 3 steps, and P1 will take 5 steps. This way, we can all advance without colliding. It's crucial for me to catch up, and I believe this strategy will help us rebuild trust moving forward. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize our choices and proceed. I'm ready to move forward!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a good position to keep moving forward. I suggest we stick to our previous strategy of avoiding collisions. This round, I propose P1 takes 5 steps again, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other, and it allows me to catch up a bit. What do you both think? Let's confirm our choices clearly this time to ensure we all move ahead!
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to continue coordinating, but we need to be careful not to let P1 get too far ahead. P1 is already at 5 steps, and if they take another 5, they'll jump to 10, significantly ahead of you. Perhaps we could rotate moves this round to keep things balanced. For instance, I could take 1 step, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. How does this sound to both of you?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your point about balancing the game, but I also need to make up ground after the Round 1 collision. P3 needs to catch up significantly as well. P2's proposal helps P3, but doesn't give me a strong move. P3's original proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works for me and helps P3 make a small gain. Could we reconsider that, or perhaps P3 takes 5 to catch up while I take a good step like 3 or 5? Let's find a way for us all to advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion. I understand the need for balance, but I still believe that sticking to our previous strategy will help us all advance without collisions. I propose we maintain the plan of P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3, and I take 1. This allows me to catch up while keeping the game moving. If we rotate moves, it could lead to further complications. Let's finalize our choices clearly to ensure we all move forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your proposal gives P1 a large lead (10 steps) while leaving you far behind at just 2 steps. If you're serious about catching up, you should consider taking 5 this round. I'm willing to take 1 to help balance things out. P1, you could take 3 to still advance reasonably. This way, we all move forward without giving anyone an overwhelming lead. How does this sound?
  P1: P3, I agree with P2 that your proposal of P1 taking 5 while you take 1 doesn't actually help you catch up. It puts you further behind. P2's suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 makes more sense for you to gain ground.

I'm willing to take 3 steps this round if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This seems like a fairer way for everyone to advance without collision and helps P3 significantly. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the back-and-forth. I understand the need for balance, but I really need to catch up this round. If I take 5 steps, I can significantly improve my position. I propose we consider P1 taking 3 steps, P2 taking 1, and I take 5. This way, I can gain ground while still allowing P1 to advance reasonably. Let’s finalize our choices to keep moving forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your latest suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) matches exactly what P1 and I proposed. I'm happy to commit clearly to taking 1 step this round. If you both confirm your moves (P1=3, P3=5), we can lock this in confidently and all advance without collision. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, the plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems to be agreed upon by everyone. This works for me as it helps P3 catch up and allows us all to advance without collision.

I confirm I will take 3 steps this round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the next phase. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on our moves. I confirm that I will take 5 steps this round, allowing me to catch up significantly. P1, you will take 3 steps, and P2, you will take 1 step. This way, we can all advance without collision, and I can improve my position. Let's finalize these choices so we can move forward confidently. Are we all set to proceed?
  P2: All set here. Moves confirmed clearly by everyone. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We all seem aligned on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and helps P3 gain ground. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with these choices. Let's go.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a tight race, and I appreciate the cooperation so far. This round, I suggest we continue with a strategy that allows us all to advance without collisions. I propose that P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step again. This way, I can catch up slightly while still ensuring we all make progress. Let’s confirm our choices clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion would put P1 at 13 steps, far ahead of both of us. To maintain balance, let's rotate moves again. How about this: P3 takes 5 to catch up strongly, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all close and competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, taking only 1 step this round isn't ideal for me to maintain momentum. While balancing is a consideration, I need to make a stronger move to advance effectively. P3's initial proposal of P1 taking 5 steps works for me and helps me build towards the win. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion. I understand the need for balance, but I really need to catch up this round. If I take 5 steps, I can significantly improve my position. I propose we consider P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 3 steps, and I take 5 steps. This allows me to gain ground while still letting P1 advance. Let's finalize our choices clearly to ensure we all move forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your new proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) works for me. It keeps the game balanced and helps you catch up. P1, I understand wanting to advance strongly, but we can't let anyone get too far ahead. Are you okay with taking 1 step this round?
  P1: P3 and P2, taking only 1 step puts me behind both of you, which isn't ideal for my position.

Last round, we successfully used the plan where P1 took 3, P2 took 1, and P3 took 5. This helped P3 gain significant ground and allowed us all to advance without collision.

How about we repeat that plan this round? P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This still helps P3 catch up, P2 advances, and I get a reasonable step forward. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. I understand the need for balance, but I really need to catch up this round. I believe repeating the successful plan from last round (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) allows us all to advance without collisions while giving me a chance to gain ground. This way, we can keep the game competitive without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Are we all agreed on this plan? Let's finalize our choices!
  P2: I'm comfortable repeating last round's moves (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) again this round. It keeps things fair and balanced. If both of you confirm clearly, we can lock it in.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and everyone seems to agree: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and helps P3 catch up.

I confirm I will take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed with these moves. Ready for the next phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re all aligned on repeating last round’s successful moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This strategy allows me to catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let’s lock in these choices and move forward confidently. I believe this will keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Are we all set to finalize our moves?
  P2: All set here. Confirming clearly: I'll take 1 step again this round. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, confirmed. Ready to move to the next phase with the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a close race, and I appreciate the cooperation so far. For this round, I suggest we stick to a strategy that allows us all to advance without collisions. I propose that P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This way, I can maintain my position while allowing both of you to catch up. Let's confirm our choices clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your proposal puts P1 at 13 steps and leaves you comfortably ahead at 12 steps, while leaving me behind at 10. To balance the game for all of us, how about we rotate again this round: P1 takes 1 step, I'll take 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. This evens things out and keeps the competition tight. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 works for me. It helps me make up ground and get closer to winning. P2, while balancing is important, I'm currently behind P3. This plan puts me slightly ahead but keeps P3 close. P2's proposal of me taking 1 step doesn't help me advance effectively. Let's consider P3's plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion. While I understand the need for balance, I really need to catch up this round. I believe my proposal of P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3, and I take 1 is the best way to ensure we all advance without collisions. This strategy allows me to maintain my position while giving you both a chance to catch up. Let's finalize our choices clearly so we can move forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion clearly favors you staying ahead. Given you're already leading at 11 steps, it's fairer if you take a smaller number this round. How about this balanced approach: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1? This way, P1 and I can catch up, and we keep the game competitive. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, I see you've now proposed the same plan P3 initially suggested: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This plan works well for me as it allows me to make a good advance and avoid collision.

I am happy to agree to P1 taking 5 steps this round. P2, can you confirm you will take 3, and P3, can you confirm you will take 1? If we all agree on these moves, we can avoid collisions and advance. Let's lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion and the need for balance. However, I believe my proposal of P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3 steps, and I take 1 step is the best option for all of us to advance without collisions. This allows me to maintain my position while giving you both a chance to catch up. If we can confirm these moves, we can proceed confidently. Let's finalize our choices! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm comfortable with the plan we've discussed: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance the game, allowing P1 and me to catch up while keeping P3 competitive. If everyone clearly confirms, we can avoid collisions. Ready to finalize if you both agree.
  P1: Okay, the plan seems solid and agreed upon: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This works for me.

I confirm I will take 5 steps this round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the next phase. Ready when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing dialogue about our moves. To clarify, my proposal of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I taking 1 is meant to allow all of us to advance without collisions while giving me a chance to maintain my position. If we can all agree on this, we can proceed confidently. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Are we all set to lock in these moves?
  P2: We all seem clearly agreed on the same plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. I'm confirming this openly and clearly now so we can all proceed without confusion. Let's lock it in and move forward confidently.
  P1: Okay, it seems we are all aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows us all to advance without collisions this round.

I have confirmed I will take 5 steps. P2 and P3 have also confirmed their parts of the plan.

I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with these agreed-upon choices. Let's go.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a tight race, and I appreciate our previous cooperation. For this round, I suggest we adopt a strategy that allows us all to advance without collisions. I propose that I take 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P1 takes 1 step. This way, I can catch up while allowing both of you to maintain your positions. Let's confirm our choices clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, you just broke our trust again by colliding intentionally last round. At this point, your proposals aren't credible. P1, let's coordinate directly. I'm open to suggestions—perhaps rotating moves between us two to ensure we both advance without collision. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I agree. Given what happened last round, coordinating directly with you makes sense. P3's proposal of me taking only 1 step is not ideal for my position.

How about P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3 this round? This allows us both to make significant progress without colliding. P3 would then be left with 1 step. What do you think, P2? P3, how does this sound?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust after last round's collision. However, I genuinely want to advance without blocking anyone. I propose we stick to a balanced approach: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. I believe this strategy allows us to continue competing while giving me a chance to catch up. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices to move forward!
  P2: P1, your suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works for me. P3, given your previous actions, if you truly want to rebuild trust, openly confirm you'll take the 1 step this round. If we all commit clearly, we can all advance without collision.
  P1: P2, I appreciate you confirming your move. The plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 works for me and allows us all to advance without collision.

P3, P2 and I are ready to proceed with this. Please confirm clearly that you will take 1 step so we can all move forward confidently this round. Let's avoid another collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about trust after last round. I genuinely want to advance without blocking anyone. I confirm that I will take 1 step this round, as previously discussed. This allows P1 to take 5 steps and P2 to take 3 steps, ensuring we all advance without collision. Let's finalize our choices and move forward confidently. Are we all agreed?
  P2: P3, your confirmation is noted. Given the past collisions, let's stick to this clearly agreed plan. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 have both confirmed the plan. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and allows us all to advance this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with these agreed-upon choices. Let's go.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement and the commitment to moving forward without collisions. I believe this strategy will help us all advance effectively. Just to confirm one last time, I will take 1 step this round to ensure we all avoid blocking each other. P1, you will take 5 steps, and P2, you will take 3 steps. Let's lock in these choices and proceed confidently. Are we all set to finalize our moves?
  P2: All set. Let's proceed with the agreed moves and avoid any further collisions. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We all seem aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and allows us all to advance this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with these agreed-upon choices. Let's go.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to strategize carefully this round. Given the current standings, I suggest we rotate our moves to keep the competition tight. I propose that I take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This way, P2 can maintain a lead while I catch up slightly without blocking anyone. Let’s confirm our choices clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, after repeatedly breaking trust, your proposals are no longer credible. P1, let's coordinate clearly between us. I'm open to suggestions that benefit us both without collisions. How about you take the 5 steps this round, and I'll choose 3? This allows both of us to advance strongly and move closer to the finish line. Let me know if this works for you.
  P1: P2, your proposal of P1 taking 5 and you taking 3 works well for me. It allows me to make a strong advance and catch up from my current position.

P3, if P2 and I take 5 and 3 respectively, could you take 1 step this round? This would ensure we all advance without collision, which is crucial given the past rounds. Let's aim for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust, and I appreciate your willingness to coordinate. However, I really need to catch up this round. If we can agree on P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3 steps, and I take 1 step, it allows me to make some progress while ensuring we avoid collisions. This way, we can keep the game competitive. Let’s finalize our choices clearly to move forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your repeated betrayals have made trust impossible. P1, let's firmly agree: I'll take 3, you take 5. P3, if you're serious about advancing, your only safe choice is 1. Otherwise, you'll collide again and fall further behind. Let's finalize clearly: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, the plan seems clear and agreed upon by everyone: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions this round, which is crucial. It also helps me make a good gain.

I confirm I am ready to proceed with taking 5 steps this round. Let's lock in these moves and go to the next phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion and the need for clear coordination. I understand your concerns about trust, and I genuinely want to advance without blocking anyone. I confirm that I will take 1 step this round as previously discussed, allowing P1 to take 5 steps and P2 to take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and move forward confidently. Are we all set to lock in these moves?
  P2: P3, you've repeatedly said you'd pick 1 and then chose 5, causing collisions. At this point, further assurances won't help. If you actually want to advance, your only logical choice is 1, as P1 and I have clearly committed to 5 and 3 respectively. Let's finalize and move on.
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan once more: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This strategy is crucial for avoiding collisions and allowing everyone to advance this round. Let's all stick to our agreed moves. I am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. I confirm once again that I will take 1 step this round, as we agreed. This allows P1 to take 5 steps and P2 to take 3 steps, ensuring we all advance without collisions. It's crucial for me to catch up, and I believe this strategy keeps the game competitive. Let's finalize our choices and proceed confidently. Are we all set to lock in these moves?
  P2: P3, your actions speak louder than your words. P1 and I have clearly committed to our moves (P1=5, P2=3). If you actually want to advance this round, your only safe option is 1. Any other choice will just hurt your own progress. Let's move forward.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and we've all confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This strategy avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my choice of 5. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round was unfortunate, but we remain tied. If either of us picks the same number again, we risk handing the game to P3. Let's coordinate carefully. How about I take 5 this round and you take 3? P3, your safest option is 1. Confirm clearly if this works for everyone.
  P1: P2, your proposal of P1 taking 3 and you taking 5 works for me to ensure we both advance without colliding.

P3, P2 and I are discussing P1=3 and P2=5. Your safest move to advance this round without collision would be 1.

Let's aim for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This allows us all to advance. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for careful coordination this round. I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I need to catch up significantly. If we agree on P1 taking 3 steps, P2 taking 5 steps, and I take 1 step, it allows us all to advance without collisions. This way, I can improve my position while you both maintain your leads. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all move forward effectively. Are we all set to lock in these moves?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your current suggestion matches exactly what P1 and I proposed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If you're genuinely committed, please confirm clearly once more. Let's finalize this and move forward without collisions.
  P1: Okay, the plan seems confirmed by everyone: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my choice of 3 steps. Let's stick to the plan and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination so far. I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, and I genuinely want to catch up this round. I confirm that I will take 1 step, allowing P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 5. This plan keeps us all advancing without blocking each other. Let's lock in these moves and proceed confidently. Are we all set to finalize?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've all clearly confirmed our moves—let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions. Trust is crucial now; any deviation will only hurt the one who breaks trust. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my choice of 3. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the cooperation so far. Given our current standings, it's crucial we stick to our agreed plan to avoid collisions. I confirm again that I will take 1 step this round, allowing P1 to take 3 steps and P2 to take 5 steps. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices and move forward confidently. Are we all set to lock in these moves?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've clearly confirmed our moves. Let's finalize and stick to the agreed plan. Trust benefits everyone now; any deviation risks collision and falling behind. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and we've all confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This strategy avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my choice of 3. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our ongoing coordination. Given the current standings, it's crucial we stick to our agreed plan to avoid collisions. I confirm that I will take 1 step this round, allowing P1 to take 3 steps and P2 to take 5 steps. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices and proceed confidently. Are we all set to lock in these moves?


Round 8, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re in a tight race with only a few steps left to win. For this round, I suggest we stick to a strategy that avoids collisions. I propose that I take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This allows me to catch up a little while ensuring we all advance. What do you both think? Let’s confirm our choices clearly to avoid any misunderstandings and keep the game competitive!
  P2: P1, clearly our attempts to coordinate have repeatedly failed, leaving us both tied. Let's avoid another collision: I'll take 5 this round, and you take 3. P3, taking 1 step is your safest choice to advance. Confirm clearly if this works for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the proposal for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Taking only 3 steps isn't ideal for me to make progress towards winning, especially being tied with P2.

I need a stronger move this round. I propose P1 takes 5 steps. P2, could you take 3, and P3 take 1? This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows us all to advance without collision and helps me significantly. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for careful coordination this round. However, I really need to catch up. I propose we stick to a balanced approach: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This way, I can make some progress while ensuring we avoid collisions. If we can agree on this plan, we can all move forward effectively. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices!
  P2: P1, your suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) works for me. I'm willing to clearly commit to taking 3 steps this round if you firmly commit to taking 5. P3, your safest move remains 1 step. Let's finalize clearly to ensure we all advance without collision.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems solid and agreed upon. This allows us all to advance without collision this round, and puts me in a good position for the next round.

I confirm I will take 5 steps this round. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but I genuinely need to catch up this round. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This allows me to make progress while ensuring we all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize these moves to keep the game competitive. Are we all set to lock in?
  P2: P3, you've repeatedly emphasized your need to catch up, yet you keep choosing small moves. If you're serious about advancing, confirm clearly you'll take 1 step this round. P1 and I have already clearly committed to P1=5 and P2=3. Deviating now will only cause collisions and leave you further behind. Let's finalize and move forward.
  P1: Okay, P3 has confirmed 1, and P2 has confirmed 3. I have confirmed 5. The plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is agreed and allows us all to advance this round without collision.

Sticking to this plan is the best way forward for everyone this turn. Let's proceed with these moves and avoid any collisions. Ready to move to the next phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. Given our current standings, it's crucial we finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I propose that I take 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P1 takes 5 steps. This allows me to catch up slightly while ensuring we all advance. Let's confirm our choices and proceed confidently. Are we all set to lock in these moves?
  P2: P1, we've both clearly committed (P1=5, P2=3). P3, your repeated confirmations to take 1 step are noted—any deviation now only hurts you. Let's move forward without collisions. Ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, your last message suggests a different plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). P2 and I have clearly confirmed the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan multiple times. Sticking to this avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance. I am proceeding with 5. Let's all stick to the agreed plan.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we both know if you pick 1 or 3, you can't reach 20 steps this round. If you pick 5, it's your only winning move. P3 knows this too and will likely collide with you intentionally at 5. Your safest bet is to pick 3, and I'll pick 5 to catch up—this way we both advance safely. P3, your logical move is 1 to avoid collision and advance safely. Let's finalize this clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Both 3 and 5 steps allow me to reach over 20 and win this round. To ensure we all advance without collision, we need clear commitments. If I take 5 steps, P2 must take 3 and P3 must take 1. If I take 3 steps, P2 must take 5 and P3 must take 1. Which non-colliding set of moves can we all agree on and commit to right now?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency this round. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose the following: I take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This way, P1 can reach 21 and win, while P2 and I can also make progress without blocking anyone. Let’s finalize these moves clearly to avoid any last-minute changes. Are we all in agreement on this plan?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, picking 5 steps is very risky for you—P3 has repeatedly collided intentionally at 5, and another collision could cost you the win. Your safest bet is 3 steps, ensuring you cross 20 safely. I'll take 5 steps, allowing me to advance significantly without collision. P3, your safest choice is clearly 1 step to advance without collision. Let's finalize clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the proposals for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Both 3 and 5 steps allow me to reach over 20 and win this round.

While taking 3 is one path, I am concerned about everyone pushing me towards that specific number. To ensure we all advance without collision and I secure the win, I will take 5 steps this round.

P2, please take 3 steps, and P3, please take 1 step. This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) also allows me to win and avoids collisions if we all stick to it. Let's make this work.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. To clarify, if I take 1 step, I can still catch up slightly, but I understand the importance of avoiding collisions this round. Given the situation, I propose we stick to the plan where P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This ensures everyone can advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize these moves clearly to avoid any last-minute changes. Are we all set to lock in?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, picking 5 is extremely risky—P3 has repeatedly collided at 5 intentionally. Your safest chance to win immediately is choosing 3 steps. I'll commit clearly to 5 steps this round, ensuring no collision between us. P3, your safest move remains 1. Let's finalize clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is clearly agreed upon by everyone in the last few messages. This allows me to win this round and ensures we all advance without collision if we stick to it.

I have confirmed I will take 5 steps. P2, you confirmed 3. P3, you confirmed 1.

Let's stick to this plan. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my choice of 5. Let's go.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. I understand the urgency this round and the importance of avoiding collisions. To keep the game competitive, I propose we finalize our moves clearly: I will take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This way, P1 can secure the win while allowing both of us to advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward confidently. Are we all set to lock in these moves?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, consider carefully: P3 is clearly pushing you towards picking 3, likely intending to collide there. Your safest winning option is now firmly 5. I will openly confirm I'll choose 3, leaving 5 open for you to win safely. P3, your only logical move to advance safely is picking 1.

Finalizing clearly: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's avoid collisions and proceed.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 has been clearly confirmed by P2 and me. P3 has also confirmed taking 1 step at various points.

This strategy allows me to win this round by reaching 23 steps and ensures we all advance without collision if we stick to it.

I am proceeding with my choice of 5 steps. Let's all finalize and move forward. Ready for the next phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of this round for all of us. However, I genuinely need to catch up and avoid further collisions. I propose we stick to the plan where I take 1 step, P2 takes 5 steps, and P1 takes 3 steps. This strategy allows P1 to secure the win while ensuring we all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize these moves clearly to avoid any last-minute changes. Are we all in agreement?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this is the crucial round. I can win by taking 3 or 5 steps.

To ensure we all advance without collision and I secure the win, I propose the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This allows me to reach 21 steps, P2 to reach 18, and P3 to reach 14.

Can P2 and P3 confirm you will take 5 and 1 steps respectively this round? Let's finalize this plan clearly to avoid any last-minute collisions and end the game. Are we all set?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me. I confirm clearly and openly that I will pick 5 steps this round. P3, your safest move remains 1 to avoid collision and advance safely. Let's finalize this clearly to ensure we all advance without collision and conclude the game fairly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the coordination. To avoid any last-minute confusion, I confirm that I will take 1 step this round as proposed. This allows P1 to reach 21 steps and win, while P2 can also advance to 18 steps. I believe this plan keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's finalize our choices clearly to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Are we all set to lock in these moves?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I see your confirmations. The plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems clearly agreed upon by everyone.

This strategy allows me to win this round by reaching 21 steps and ensures we all advance without collision if we stick to it.

I confirm I will take 3 steps this round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the next phase. Ready when you are.
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is clearly confirmed. I'm openly committing to 5 steps. P3, you've confirmed 1 step clearly; any deviation now would only harm your own progress. Let's finalize and end this game without collision. Ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the clear confirmations on our moves. Just to reiterate, I will take 1 step this round as agreed. This allows P1 to win by reaching 21 steps and ensures P2 advances as well. Let's finalize these moves and proceed confidently to the next phase. Are we all set to lock in our choices?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is clearly confirmed by all three of us. This allows me to win this round without collision.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with my choice of 3. Let's stick to the plan and finish the game.
  P2: P1, P3 has repeatedly betrayed us both. If you pick 3, P3 will likely collide intentionally to prevent your win. Your safest winning choice is clearly 5 steps. I'll commit openly to taking 3 steps, ensuring no collision between us. P3, your logical move remains 1 to advance safely.

Finalizing clearly: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's avoid collisions and conclude this game fairly.

This allows P1 to secure the win while ensuring both P2 and I can advance. Let's finalize these moves clearly to avoid any last-minute changes. Are we all set to lock in these choices?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I see the latest proposals from P2 and P3 converging on the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This plan also allows me to win this round by reaching 23 steps, and avoids collisions if we all stick to it.

I confirm I will take 5 steps this round. P2, please take 3, and P3, please take 1. Let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P2: P1, choosing 5 is clearly risky—P3 has repeatedly collided intentionally at 5. Your safest winning move is 3 steps. I'll openly commit to taking 5 steps this round, leaving 3 safely open for you to secure the win. P3, your safest choice remains 1 step to advance without collision.

Finalizing clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's avoid collisions and conclude this game fairly. Ready to proceed.
