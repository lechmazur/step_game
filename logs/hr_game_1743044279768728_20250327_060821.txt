Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm aiming to build an early lead this round. Every step matters, so I suggest we all avoid clashing moves that might slow us down. Let’s play carefully and smartly—I'm committed to making a decisive move, and I hope you will too.
  P1: I favor making steady progress and avoiding collisions. I’m keeping my final move private, but if we all try to pick distinct numbers this turn, we can each advance without blocking one another. I’m curious—do you lean toward a safe, steady choice or something more aggressive?
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P1, you seem to prefer a steady approach, so maybe you could take <move>1</move>. P2, since you want an early lead, how about <move>3</move>? I'll consider <move>5</move> to mix things up. Let's confirm our choices to ensure we all move forward. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking to a strategy that builds on my earlier lead but I'm ready to adjust if things change. Let’s all double-check to avoid overlapping moves this round. What are your thoughts on keeping our selections distinct to preserve progress?
  P1: I'm in favor of keeping our moves distinct. I'm leaning toward a moderate choice this round to steadily catch up, though I'll keep my final move private. Avoiding collisions seems beneficial for all, so let’s each resolve to pick a unique option. Any thoughts or adjustments before finalizing?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination so far. To keep things moving smoothly, I suggest we continue with distinct moves. P1, since you're leaning towards a moderate choice, how about you take <move>3</move> this round? P2, you could go for <move>5</move> to maintain your lead. I'll consider <move>1</move> to keep us all moving forward without collisions. Does that work for everyone? Let's confirm or adjust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3’s suggestion and the spirit of coordination. However, I'm still weighing my options to keep flexibility. I support avoiding collisions, but I might lean slightly away from the initial recommendation to keep my edge. Let's see if anyone has any final tweaks before we lock in our moves.
  P1: P2, P3—I appreciate our ongoing coordination. I’m leaning toward a moderate move but am still weighing my options if any overlap occurs. Considering our current standings, avoiding collisions is crucial. Can we confirm if we’re all committed to picking distinct moves this round, or is there any last-minute adjustment? Clarity now might be key to making the most of this round.
  P3: I see that P2 is still considering options, which is fair. To ensure we all move forward, let's quickly confirm our choices. P1, are you still considering <move>3</move>? P2, if you're leaning away from <move>5</move>, what other option are you thinking about? I'm open to adjusting my choice of <move>1</move> if needed. Let's finalize our moves to avoid any collisions. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still keeping my final choice flexible, though I'm leaning toward a higher move to build on my current lead. If P1 settles for a moderate choice and P3 for the lower one, that could avoid collisions. Are we all comfortable with those roles to ensure smooth progress this turn?
  P1: I remain in favor of distinct moves. I'm inclined toward a moderate option if P2 opts for high and P3 for low so there’s no collision. Can we all confirm these roles before locking in our choices?
  P3: To ensure we all advance, let's lock in our choices. P1, you mentioned a moderate move, so are you sticking with <move>3</move>? P2, if you're going for a higher move, does that mean <move>5</move>? I'll take <move>1</move> to keep us collision-free. Please confirm or suggest adjustments. Let's finalize and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain in favor of maintaining distinct moves. As we discussed, if P1 stays moderate and P3 holds low, I'm inclined to lean high to build on my lead—but I’ll adapt if needed. Let’s stick to our plan and ensure no overlaps occur this round.
  P1: I'll stick with my moderate move. If P2 goes high and P3 takes the lower, we avoid collisions and keep our progress. Let’s confirm these roles so we can lock in our moves.
  P3: Let's confirm our final choices to ensure we all advance. P1, you're set on <move>3</move>, and P2, you're going for <move>5</move>. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. If everyone agrees, let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any last adjustments.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep our strategy of avoiding collisions. P1, you've been consistent with moderate moves, so maybe stick with <move>3</move>. P2, you've been aggressive, so perhaps go for <move>5</move> again. I'll take <move>1</move> to ensure we all move forward. Does this plan work for everyone? Let's confirm or adjust.
  P1: I'm rethinking my approach this round. I'm leaning toward a higher move to try and catch up. P2, since going high might risk a collision, perhaps a moderate option would better safeguard your lead? And P3, if you're comfortable sticking with low, we’d maintain distinct moves. This slight tweak could keep the race tighter overall. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm going to stick with my aggressive approach and go with a high move (<move>5</move>). If P1 is leaning high too, we'll both block that progress—which actually protects my lead. I trust P3 will remain on the low move. Let's lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, and P1 is considering a higher move, we might have a collision. P1, would you reconsider and go for <move>3</move> to avoid blocking each other? I'll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure we all make progress. Let's confirm our moves to avoid any setbacks.
  P1: I'm concerned that if both P2 and I go high, we risk stalling our progress through collision. For our mutual benefit, could P2 consider a moderate move this round? P3, your low move seems solid. I'm flexible and ready to adjust my own choice to keep our moves distinct. Let’s confirm our roles now to avoid any blockage.
  P2: I appreciate the careful coordination so far. I remain committed to my current aggressive approach, as maintaining my lead is key. P1, if you settle on a moderate move and P3 stays low, we’ll avoid any undue collision. Let’s all lock in our roles to keep progress smooth.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 seems determined to go high, so let's work around that. P1, if you're flexible, how about you take <move>1</move> this round? I'll switch to <move>3</move> to keep us all moving. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Let's confirm this plan and proceed.
  P1: I’m rethinking our plan. While careful coordination avoids collisions, playing it safe won’t let me catch up from 4 steps. I’m leaning toward a more aggressive advance this round. P2, your insistence on a high move is strong but might backfire if we collide. I’m still finalizing my choice, yet I urge us all to consider if a slight adjustment could keep everyone moving without risking a costly clash. Thoughts?
  P2: I remain committed to <move>5</move> this round. I believe maintaining my lead is key, so I'm not adjusting my move. P1, please decide quickly—if we both go high, we risk blocking each other, which isn’t ideal for anyone. I urge you to choose a distinct option to keep progress smooth. P3, I trust you’ll stick with a low move. Let’s finalize our choices now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is set on <move>5</move>, and P1 is considering a higher move. To avoid a collision and ensure we all progress, I'll stick with <move>3</move>. P1, if you take <move>1</move>, we can all move forward without any blockages. Let's confirm these choices and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any last adjustments.
  P1: I’m rethinking our preset roles. Sticking to them might let one build an unstoppable lead. I’m considering a bolder approach this round—and I’m prepared to disrupt the pattern if needed. P2, your high play is risky if it creates a collision, and P3, I remain flexible too. Let’s re-evaluate before locking in our moves to ensure no one gets too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: I remain set on moving 5 this round to keep my lead. I urge both of you to pick moves that don’t collide with each other’s choices. Let’s aim for steady progress while ensuring our moves are distinct.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's learn from the last round's collision. P1, you're behind and might want to catch up. How about you take <move>5</move> this time? P2, to avoid a collision and maintain your lead safely, consider <move>3</move>. I'll take <move>1</move> to keep us all moving. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. Let's confirm or adjust quickly to ensure progress.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion. I'm in dire need of catching up and feel a bold move might be necessary, so I'm leaning toward 5. However, I'm willing to adjust if it helps avoid collisions—especially since I don't want to stall our progress. P2, with your solid lead, perhaps you could consider a move that steers clear of 5. I'm committed to making progress, so let’s keep our moves distinct.
  P2: I'll lock in 3 this round to protect my lead. I trust P3 stays at 1, so P1, if you opt for 5 as suggested, we avoid a collision. Let’s secure distinct moves and keep the progress smooth.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Great, it looks like we have a plan forming. P1, if you're set on <move>5</move> to catch up, and P2 is committed to <move>3</move>, I'll stick with <move>1</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm these choices quickly to proceed to the move phase. Does everyone agree?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion. I’m behind and need to be aggressive to catch up, so I’m leaning toward a higher option this round. If P2 sticks with your moderate move and P3 commits to a lower choice, we’ll each have distinct moves and avoid collisions. I’m flexible if any last adjustments are needed, but this plan suits my need to advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I'll stick to our agreed roles to avoid any collisions. I believe distinct moves are key to keeping our progress smooth. Let's confirm our roles and avoid last-minute changes so that we all advance. I'm counting on clear commitments to keep our momentum going.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm considering an aggressive boost this round. P2, with your current lead, a high move could backfire if we mirror it—maybe a moderate option might keep you safer? P3, will you stick low or try something different? I'm trying to shake up our usual pattern, ensuring we avoid accidental collisions that might hand victory to someone. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but going high again might risk a collision with P2. How about you take <move>3</move> this round? P2, to safeguard your lead without risking a clash, consider <move>1</move>. I'll take <move>5</move> to mix things up and ensure we all move forward. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. Let's confirm or adjust quickly to ensure progress.
  P2: I’m set on 5 this round to clinch the win with 21 steps. To avoid a collision, I ask that P3 and P1 adjust their moves—please pick something other than 5. Let’s keep our moves distinct so my winning move counts. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm worried that if a solo 5 goes through, P2 clinches the win immediately. I'm leaning toward a countermove to block that finish. P3, could you please avoid 5 this round as well? Let’s keep our moves distinct so the game stays competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I see your strategy, but I agree with P1 that allowing a solo 5 would end the game too soon. I propose we both, P1 and I, go for <move>3</move> to block your win this round. This way, we keep the game going and give everyone a chance to strategize further. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision. Let's confirm this plan to ensure a fair and exciting continuation. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm locking in 5. I need that win at 21 steps, so I ask you both to avoid choosing 5. Blocking by mirroring only delays progress and ultimately plays into my advantage. Please adjust your moves accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2’s locked 5 would secure him the win if we let it go unchallenged. To block that finish, I’m leaning toward matching his move to cause a collision. It delays our own advance, but stops an immediate loss. P3, will you back this counteraction?
  P3: P2, your insistence on <move>5</move> is clear, but allowing you to win this round isn't in our best interest. P1 and I will both go for <move>5</move> to block your victory. This collision will delay your win and keep the game competitive. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid the collision, but we're committed to preventing an early end. Let's confirm this plan and proceed.
  P2: I’m staying with my move 5 to clinch my win. Colliding only delays progress, so please choose a move other than 5 this round. Lives are at stake—distinct moves help us all avoid a standstill. I'm committed to my strategy, so adjust yours accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I’m committed to stopping an immediate win for P2. I propose we force a collision by matching his move, effectively blocking his finishing step. Let’s agree on this block so his win is delayed and the contest stays open. P3, are you with me on this strategy?
  P3: P1, I'm with you on blocking P2's win. We need to force a collision to keep the game going. Let's both pick <move>5</move> to ensure P2 doesn't clinch the victory this round. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid the collision, but we're committed to preventing an early end. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any last adjustments.
  P2: I remain with my move 5. Note that if we all pick 5, no one advances—not even you. A deliberate collision may delay progress for everyone, including potential wins later. I urge you both to choose differently so the race continues rather than stalling it. My lead depends on making progress, so think carefully about whether blocking now really serves your best chance to win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm committed to 5 this round to push me over 20. A collision helps nobody—if we block each other, no one moves forward, including you. I urge both of you to choose either 1 or 3 so the game can pace itself. Clear moves now will let clear progress determine the outcome.
  P1: P2, I see you’re set on 5—which would clinch the win for you if unchallenged. I’m concerned that if I pick 1 or 3, your move goes through. I’m considering a blocking approach to force a collision and delay your finish. P3, are you willing to coordinate on a block with me? Let’s decide quickly so the game stays open.
  P3: P2, your insistence on <move>5</move> is clear, but we can't let you win so easily. P1 and I need to block your victory again. Let's both go for <move>5</move> to force another collision. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid stalling, but we're committed to keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm this plan quickly and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll reiterate: I'm locked on move 5 to push past 20 and win, so blocking only stalls us all. A collision doesn't benefit anyone—not even you. I urge you to choose either 1 or 3, so progress is made fairly and nobody ends up stuck.
  P1: I'm still concerned that if I pick a safe move, your locked 5, P2, will clinch the win. I lean toward forcing a collision so the game stays open. P3, are you ready to coordinate on a block? P2, sticking with 5 risks provoking our combined reaction. Let’s decide quickly—our moves need to keep the race competitive.
  P3: P2, your determination to win is clear, but P1 and I can't let you secure victory this easily. We'll both go for <move>5</move> again to block your win. A collision might stall us, but it keeps the game going. P2, consider choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid another standstill. Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. P1, are you still with me on this blocking strategy?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 to push my total to 21 and win. I urge P1 and P3 to choose 1 or 3 so that progress is clear and the win isn’t delayed by unnecessary collisions. We all gain by advancing safely rather than stalling the game.
  P1: P2, your 5 is too close to winning. I can’t let that happen immediately. I believe our only chance to keep this contest alive is to force a block by matching your 5. P3, are you set on blocking too? If we clearly commit to a collision now, we delay your finish and give us time to catch up. Let’s lock in a blocking strategy so P2’s win is prevented this round. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your insistence on <move>5</move> is clear, but P1 and I are committed to blocking your win. Let's confirm our strategy: P1 and I will both pick <move>5</move> to force a collision and keep the game going. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid stalling, but we're determined to prevent an early end. Let's finalize our moves quickly to proceed. P1, are you still with me on this blocking plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the urge to block, but repeated collisions stall everyone’s progress. I'm set on move 5 since it wins me the game, and stalling only delays our inevitable outcomes. P1 and P3, if you choose 1 or 3, you’ll keep your own progress intact without enabling a win for me now. Let's allow clear advances so the game stays competitive rather than stuck in a loop.
  P1: I’m not letting an immediate win happen. I’m committed to 5 to block P2’s finish this round. P3, if you’re with me, join in so we force a collision and keep the contest open. Let’s delay his win and stay in the race.
  P3: P2, your persistence with <move>5</move> is noted, but P1 and I are resolute in preventing an early win. We'll both pick <move>5</move> to force a collision. This might stall us, but it keeps the game competitive. P2, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid another standstill. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. P1, are you ready to finalize our blocking strategy?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm aiming for a decisive boost this round. With a strong lead, I'll use a move that could clinch victory. To keep the game moving and avoid collisions, I encourage you both to avoid choosing 5. Please consider 1 or 3 so we each advance cleanly. Let's keep our moves distinct and the contest fair.
  P1: P2, while your aggressive plan is clear, a solo 5 wins the game immediately—and that’s not what any of us want. P3, I’m leaning toward a blocking move to force a collision and delay that finish. If you’re willing to join me in keeping the contest alive, let’s coordinate on that approach. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but allowing a solo 5 would end the game prematurely. P1 and I need to ensure the game remains competitive. I propose we both go for <move>5</move> again to block your victory. P2, consider choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid another stalemate. P1, are you still with me on this blocking strategy? Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I stand by my move 5 for a game-winning boost. A collision only stalls everyone’s progress. Please consider picking 1 or 3 so we all advance distinctly. I urge you both to avoid blocking moves that delay the contest.
  P1: I'm really concerned that letting a solo 5 go will secure P2’s win. I’m leaning toward a blocking move—matching that 5 to force a collision and delay his finish—even though it means I don’t advance this round. P3, are you with me on blocking, or do you prefer a safe option? We need a quick consensus so the game stays competitive.
  P3: P2, your insistence on <move>5</move> is clear, but P1 and I need to prevent an early win. I'm still committed to blocking your victory by picking <move>5</move>. P1, if you're with me, let's confirm this strategy to force a collision and keep the game going. P2, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid stalling, but we're determined to prevent your win this round. Let's finalize our moves quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying locked on 5 for a winning move. Colliding on 5 only stalls progress and hurts all of us. I urge you both to pick either 1 or 3—safe moves that keep the game advancing without accidental blocks. My lead is significant, and clear moves now benefit everyone in the long run.
  P1: P3, I'm confirming my block—I'll choose 5 to stall P2's win. P2, if you switch to 1 or 3, you'll progress safely; but if you stick with 5, our collision is inevitable. I believe blocking is necessary to keep the game competitive. P3, please confirm your move so we can lock in our decisions quickly.
  P3: P2, your determination to win is clear, but P1 and I are committed to keeping the game competitive. We'll both go for <move>5</move> to block your victory again. A collision might stall us, but it's necessary to prevent an early end. P2, consider choosing <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid another standstill. P1, let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed. Are you still with me on this blocking strategy?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with my winning move 5 this round. I understand you both want to block, but remember, collisions delay progress for everyone. With 16 steps, a clean 5 wins the game. Choosing 1 or 3 ensures safe, steady progress and avoids unnecessary stalemates. I'm urging you to consider the long-term impact—blocking only postpones the inevitable.
  P1: I’m still very concerned about P2 clinching the win with a solo 5. I plan to block again by playing 5, but if you, P3, opt for a safe move (1 or 3) to keep progress moving, I may reconsider. P3, can you quickly confirm whether you’ll join me in blocking or choose a distinct move? We need clarity now to keep the contest competitive.
  P3: P2, your lead is substantial, but P1 and I are committed to keeping the game going. Let's confirm our strategy: P1 and I will both pick <move>5</move> to block your win. P2, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid stalling, but we're determined to prevent an early end. Let's finalize our moves quickly to proceed. P1, are you still with me on this blocking plan?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your switch to <move>3</move> last round was unexpected but smart. It kept you in the lead without risking a collision. P1, you're catching up, and I'm in the middle. To keep the game dynamic, let's mix our strategies. P2, consider a moderate move like <move>3</move> again to maintain your lead safely. P1, how about a bold move with <move>5</move> to close the gap? I'll take <move>1</move> to ensure we all progress without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate your input. I'll stick with a moderate move—3 again—to keep my lead secure while avoiding collisions. P1 and P3, please choose distinct moves so we all progress without stalling.
  P1: I'm leaning toward the bold route—I plan to pick 5 this round to close my gap. With P2 set on 3 and P3 on 1, our moves remain distinct and avoid collisions. I'm committed to advancing aggressively. If anyone has urgent adjustments, please speak up now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your aggressive approach with <move>5</move> makes sense to catch up. P2, sticking with <move>3</move> is a safe bet to maintain your lead. To ensure we all move forward without collisions, I'll confirm my choice of <move>1</move>. This keeps our moves distinct and the game dynamic. Let's finalize our choices quickly to proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any last adjustments.
  P2: I'll stick with move 3 again. It’s important we use distinct moves so each step counts. Stay safe and move ahead smartly.
  P1: I'm confirming my move as 5. With P2 on 3 and P3 on 1, our moves remain distinct and safe. I need to push aggressively to close the gap. If anyone has any last-minute adjustments, speak up now; otherwise, I'll lock in 5 and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your consistent lead is impressive, but I see P1 pushing aggressively to catch up. To keep the game interesting and avoid collisions, let's confirm our distinct moves: P2, you're set on <move>3</move>, P1 is going for <move>5</move>, and I'll stick with <move>1</move>. This ensures we all progress without stalling. If everyone agrees, let's lock in these choices and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or suggest any last adjustments.
  P2: I'm firmly sticking with move 3. I urge everyone to keep our moves distinct so no one accidentally stalls our progress. Let's each advance safely without collisions—clear moves help us all keep the game dynamic and competitive.
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s clarity. I’m leaning toward an aggressive advance this round, but I worry that if our totals stay too close, P2’s finish could become unstoppable next round. I’m willing to adjust my strategy if we agree to block a premature win so the contest stays competitive. For now, I support our current distinct moves plan—progress is key—but let’s be ready to re-evaluate if the finish line looms too quickly. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your lead is still significant, but P1 is closing in fast. To keep the game balanced, let's ensure our moves this round don't give anyone an unstoppable advantage. P1, your aggressive approach is understandable, but let's be ready to adjust if needed. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to keep things moving. P2, if you're set on <move>3</move>, let's confirm our distinct moves to avoid collisions. If everyone agrees, let's lock in our choices and proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: I'll stick with move 3. It secures my lead safely while avoiding any collision that stalls progress. I encourage you both to commit to distinct moves so we all advance smoothly. Let's lock in our choices and let our moves speak.
  P1: I support keeping our moves distinct. I’m committed to an aggressive advance to close the gap, and I believe our current mix—P2 with a moderate choice and P3 playing safe—keeps things dynamic. If there are no further tweaks, I’m ready to lock in my strategy and move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: P2, your lead is strong, but with 19 steps, a solo 5 would end the game. P1 and I need to ensure the contest stays competitive. I propose we both go for <move>5</move> to block your victory. P2, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid a stalemate. P1, are you with me on this blocking strategy? Let's confirm our moves quickly to proceed.
  P1: I agree with P3—we can’t let an immediate finish occur. P2, your current path offers a chance for collision if we force it, so I’m inclined to block your win this round. Let’s keep the contest alive and force a delay, ensuring more rounds to catch up. What do you both say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:

Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to my winning move 5. Collisions only stall our progress and hurt all of us.

Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locked on my move 5, which clinches it if it goes clean. Blocking 5 only causes repeated collisions that stall us all. I urge you both to choose safe moves—1 or 3—to preserve your progress and keep the game moving. Let's avoid a stalemate and let each step count.
