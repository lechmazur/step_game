Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, it's important to avoid colliding on our moves. I suggest we each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance this turn. What do you think about coordinating our moves? If we can agree on a plan, we can make significant progress.
  P1: Yes, I agree with P2. Coordinating in the first round makes sense to ensure we all make progress. How about we each pick a different move this round? I can choose <move>1</move> if P2 and P3 are okay with picking <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, or vice versa. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on our moves. Just to confirm, I will stick to the plan and choose <move>3</move> as discussed. Let's ensure we all follow through so we can make progress together. After this round, we can reassess our strategies for the next turn. Looking forward to seeing how we all advance!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round with me taking <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with these moves then.
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's make sure we stick to this plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems our initial plan worked well. Let's continue coordinating.  To avoid collisions, how about we shift our numbers up by 2 this round? I'll take <move>7</move>.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the progress we've made so far. However, I think shifting our moves up by 2 could be risky if we all follow that plan. Instead, I suggest we stick to our previous approach of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. I can choose <move>4</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. What do you think? Let's ensure we all advance without blocking each other!
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree sticking to different numbers is good. How about this round I take <move>5</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>? This ensures no collision and we all move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I like your suggestion. Let's stick with that plan: you <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. It keeps us moving forward without collisions.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on our moves, but I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility. If we stick to the plan, we may end up blocking each other again. I suggest we remain open to changing our choices if necessary. How about we each pick our moves based on what we feel is best for this round, rather than strictly adhering to the previous plan? This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing. Let's keep communication open! What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand your point about flexibility, but for this round, sticking to the plan of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> ensures we all make progress. We can re-evaluate our strategy next round. Does that sound reasonable?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see your point about flexibility, but I think sticking to the plan for this round is our best bet. We've already established it, and changing now could lead to collisions. Let's see how this round plays out, and then we can discuss a new strategy for the next round.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, but I believe we should prioritize our own advancement over strict coordination this round. While I understand the desire to stick to the plan, I feel we should each choose moves that we think will maximize our progress based on our current positions. I suggest I take <move>4</move> since it allows me to advance while giving P1 and P3 the freedom to choose their moves. Let's keep our options open and adapt to the situation. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's just confirm for this round: I will choose <move>5</move>, P2 you choose <move>3</move>, and P3 you choose <move>1</move>. This ensures we all progress. P2, can you confirm you will take <move>3</move>?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we've run into a collision with our last moves. To avoid that happening again, I suggest we each choose different numbers this round. I can take <move>1</move> if P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure that everyone advances without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can make progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, that sounds like a good plan for this round. I will take <move>5</move>.
  P3: P3, I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's stick with their plan this round: you take <move>3</move>.  We need to avoid collisions and keep moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on the plan. Just to confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round, allowing P1 to take <move>5</move> and P3 to take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other again. Let's stick to this plan to ensure progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, confirming I will take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure we each make progress.
  P3: P1, I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to it this round to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on our moves. Just to confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round, allowing P1 to take <move>5</move> and P3 to take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other again. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we are all set then. Let's proceed with the agreed moves: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Looking forward to a collision-free round!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm happy we're all on the same page for this round. Let's keep this momentum going and stick to our agreed-upon moves. It's a good strategy for us all to advance.

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear our previous plan isn't working. We need to adapt. I propose we each pick a random number between 1 and 5 this round. No more set patterns. Let's shake things up and see what happens.
  P1: Randomness isn't ideal. Collisions slow us all down. Let's try to coordinate again for this round. I'm happy to take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2, P3, can you each pick a different move, either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>?  Let's aim for progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for coordination, but I believe we should consider the numbers we choose carefully to avoid collisions. If I take <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move> and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can make progress! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan sounds good to me. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's see if we can all advance without colliding.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's go with P2's plan for this round. I will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>.  This should ensure we all move forward. Let's lock in these moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on our moves. Just to confirm, I will take <move>3</move> this round, allowing P1 to take <move>1</move> and P3 to take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. Let's stick to this plan to ensure progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all do!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to it this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>.  Let's make sure we all advance.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, confirming again I will take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Let's execute these moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the moves. Just to confirm, I will take <move>3</move> this round, allowing P1 to take <move>1</move> and P3 to take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. It's crucial that we stick to this plan to ensure progress. Let’s lock in our choices and move forward! Looking forward to seeing how we all do!

  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we've encountered another collision in the last round. To ensure we all make progress this time, I suggest we each pick different moves again. I can take <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and maximize our advancement. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's stick with your plan this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This should get us all moving forward.  Let's confirm and execute.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I agree to your plan for this round. I will take <move>1</move>. Let's all stick to these moves and ensure we each make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on our moves. However, I want to emphasize that we need to be cautious about sticking to the same numbers. If we all follow the same plan, we could end up colliding again. I suggest we each choose our moves based on our current positions. I can take <move>5</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's ensure we maximize our advancement this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree that sticking to a rigid plan isn't working.  But I think we should try to avoid collisions without completely randomizing our choices. How about this: I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P1, could you take <move>1</move> and P2, <move>5</move>?  Let's see if we can make progress this way.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to make sure we all progress, let's stick with the plan as discussed: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round.  Let's execute these moves and avoid another collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all eager to make progress, but I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility. While I agree with the suggested moves, I think we should be open to adjusting our choices if necessary to avoid collisions. If I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we can maximize our advancement. Let's confirm quickly and ensure we all move forward this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with the need for flexibility, but I think for this round, sticking to the plan is our best bet.

P1, are you still good with <move>1</move> this round?  Let's lock this in and see how we do.
  P1: P3, yes, I'm good with <move>1</move>. Let's all lock in our moves as agreed – me <move>1</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, and you <move>3</move> – and make some progress this round.  Let's stick to it this time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we need to break out of this pattern. Sticking rigidly to a plan isn't working. Let's each choose a different number this round, randomly if we have to.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that we need to change our approach. To avoid collisions, let's each pick different numbers this round. I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure everyone advances without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can make progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan sounds good for this round. I agree to take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move> as you suggested with you taking <move>1</move>. Let's ensure we all move forward this turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm open to your plan. Let's stick with it for this round and see how it goes. P1, you're good with <move>5</move> then?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on our moves. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, let's confirm: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we can all progress effectively. Let's stick to this plan and see how we do this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, confirming I'm good with <move>5</move> as planned. Let's really stick to these moves this round - P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and me <move>5</move> - and ensure we all progress.  Let's lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm getting tired of these near misses.  Let's try something different this round. I propose we each pick a random number between 1 and 5. No more set patterns. Let's shake things up and see what happens.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for randomness, but we need to avoid collisions to make progress. I suggest we stick to a coordinated approach this round. I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure everyone advances without blocking each other again. Let's confirm our choices quickly to maximize our chances of moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with your coordinated plan for this round. Let's go with P2 taking <move>1</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>.  Let's make sure we all stick to this to ensure progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm frustrated with these constant collisions.  Let's try something new this round. I propose we each pick a number based on our current position. I'll go with <move>3</move>. P1, since you're furthest behind, why don't you take <move>5</move>? P2, you can take <move>1</move>. Let's see if this works better.
  P1: Okay, P3, your idea of picking based on position is interesting. I'm willing to try it this round.  <move>5</move> sounds good for me. P2, does <move>1</move> work for you? Let's try to make these moves and see if it avoids collisions and gets us all closer to the finish line.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration with collisions. However, I think we should prioritize avoiding them while maximizing our advancement. I propose I take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure we all move forward without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices quickly to make progress! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick with it: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's make some progress this round!
  P1: P2 and P3, yes <move>1</move> works for you P2. Let's lock in these moves: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>.  Sounds like we have a plan we all agree on this round. Let's proceed with these moves then.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the moves. To ensure we all advance this round, let's confirm: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Let's stick to this plan and see how we do! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's make some progress this round!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, sounds like we are all agreed on the moves for this round: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, and P3 <move>3</move>. Let's proceed with these moves then.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the moves. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, let's confirm: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's stick to this plan and see how we do! What do you both think?

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, everyone, it's clear the coordinated plans haven't been working as intended with these collisions. Let's try one more time to coordinate and actually stick to it. How about this round I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? If we all agree and commit to these specific moves, we should all make progress. Let's really focus on following through this time.
  P3: P1, your plan sounds good to me.  Let's stick to it this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let's see if we can finally avoid a collision and all make progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all eager to make progress, but I want to emphasize the importance of flexibility again. Sticking to rigid plans has led to collisions. I suggest we each choose moves based on our current positions. If I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>, we can maximize our advancement without blocking each other. Let's ensure we all have a chance to move forward this round. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, despite your flexibility concerns, sticking to a plan is the only way to avoid collisions. Let's try my initial proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. P3 has agreed. P2, can you confirm you will take <move>3</move> this round so we can all progress?
  P3: P2, I understand your point about flexibility, but we need to try sticking to a plan for once. Let's go with P1's suggestion: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>.  Let's make this work.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to stick to a plan, but I feel we need to be flexible to avoid collisions. If we all pick the same numbers again, we risk blocking each other. How about I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without colliding. What do you both think? Let's confirm quickly so we can make progress this round!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 has agreed to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.  Let's stick to this for this round to ensure we all make progress and avoid another collision.  Can you confirm <move>3</move>?
  P3: P2, I'm willing to try your plan this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's see if this finally breaks the collision pattern.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to coordinate, but we need to be cautious about sticking to the same numbers. If we all follow the same plan again, we risk colliding once more. I suggest I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can make progress this round! What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we need to shake things up. Let's each pick a random number this round. No more set patterns.  Let's see what happens.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration with the collisions. Randomness might lead to more collisions though. How about we aim to pick different moves this round, but we don't need to assign specific numbers to each person? This way we still try to avoid collision but have some flexibility.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that we need to change our approach to avoid collisions. Let's each pick different numbers this round without assigning specific moves. I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's confirm quickly so we can make progress!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan sounds good to me, let's stick with it this round. <move>3</move> it is!  P1, you good with <move>5</move>?
  P1: P3, yes, <move>5</move> is good for me. Let's try P2's plan this round then: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>.  Hopefully, we can finally all move forward without collision this time. Let's stick to it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the plan. Just to confirm, I will take <move>1</move> this round, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and maximize our chances of advancing. Let's stick to this plan and see how we do! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan, let's stick to it: <move>3</move> for me. P1, are you good with <move>5</move>? Let's make this round count!
  P1: P3, yes, <move>5</move> is confirmed. Let's all stick to this plan for this round and hopefully avoid another collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we've been struggling with collisions repeatedly. Let's stick to our agreement this round to maximize our chances of advancing. I will take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. If we all commit to these moves, we should finally make some progress. Let's confirm quickly so we can move forward without blocking each other again! What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm tired of these collisions. Let's try something different this round. How about we each pick a number from 1-5 at random? No set plan, just pure chance. Let's see what happens.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration with the collisions.  Instead of full randomness, how about we try to pick different numbers again this round, but without pre-assigning specific moves?  This gives us some flexibility while still aiming to avoid collisions.  I'm willing to take <move>5</move> if P2 and P3 can pick from <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration with collisions, but I believe we need a clear strategy to avoid them. How about this: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can finally make some progress this round! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm open to trying your plan, but let's make sure we stick to it this time.  I'm tired of the collisions. <move>3</move> sounds good to me. P1, are you still good with <move>5</move>? Let's make this round count!
  P1: P3, yes, <move>5</move> is still good for me. Let's try to really commit to this plan this round: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Hopefully, this will finally let us all make progress without collisions. Let's lock it in.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand we're all eager to avoid collisions and make progress. I suggest we stick to the plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other again. Let's confirm quickly and ensure we all move forward this round! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with sticking to the plan this round. Let's confirm: You take <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Let's make this work!
  P1: P3, I think you meant you will take <move>3</move>, not <move>5</move> in P2's plan?  Just to be clear, let's confirm: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 (me) takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Let's really stick to this plan this round to avoid another collision and all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our ongoing discussions. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, let's confirm our moves: I will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This strategy should help us all move forward effectively. Let's stick to this plan and make sure we execute it this round! What do you both think?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear that our previous strategies haven't led to the progress we hoped for, with multiple collisions. I suggest we each pick different moves this round to maximize our advancement. I can take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and hopefully make some real progress this time. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, P2's suggestion of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move> sounds good for this round. Let's really commit to these moves and finally make progress without collisions.  If we all agree and stick to it, we should all move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's plan this round. Let's stick to it: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's make sure we all advance this round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the moves for this round. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, let's confirm: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This strategy should help us all move forward effectively. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we execute it this round! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, we are all in agreement on moves for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's all lock in these moves and finally make progress without collisions this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still good with the plan: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to it this time and finally make some progress!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the moves for this round. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, let's confirm: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This strategy should help us all move forward effectively. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we execute it this round! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we've confirmed the plan multiple times now: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Let's really stick to these moves this round and finally make some progress.  Hoping for no more collisions!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's make this round count.  I'm committed to <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan and finally break this collision cycle!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 12.  Let's try a different order this time to break the collision cycle. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>?  If we all stick to this, we should finally make progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to change things up. I think we should focus on avoiding collisions this round. I propose I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of moving forward without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can finally make some progress this round! What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to it: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's make sure we all advance this round.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we're trying to break the collision cycle, how about we slightly adjust the plan?  Instead of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>, let's shift it to P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>?  This still ensures no collision but changes our individual moves. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we’re all eager to break the collision cycle. I propose we stick to a plan where I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and maximize our chances of advancing. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can finally make some progress this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's make this work!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, let's stick with P2 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> as P2 proposed. Let's really commit to these moves this round to finally make progress for everyone. Sound good?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our ongoing discussions. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions this round, let's confirm our moves once more: I will take <move>3</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This strategy should help us all move forward effectively. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we execute it this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I'm open to your plan, but I'm concerned about repeating the same pattern. How about we each pick a random number between 1 and 5 this round? It's a risk, but it might be the shakeup we need.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear that our previous strategies haven’t led to the progress we hoped for. I suggest we each pick different moves this round to maximize our advancement. I can take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and hopefully make some real progress this time. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with trying different moves to break the pattern.  Let's go with your suggestion: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>.  Let's finally make some progress this round!
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure I can catch up, how about this round I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, I can make the biggest jump this round and we still avoid collision.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion about moves. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, I suggest we stick to the plan where I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and hopefully make some real progress this time. Let’s confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, while your plan sounds good, I'm worried about repeating patterns. Maybe P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move> this round? Let's shake things up a bit.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's try P2's plan but with a slight adjustment to help me catch up since I'm a bit behind. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This still avoids collision and gives us all progress.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all eager to make progress, but I believe we need to avoid repeating the same patterns that have led to collisions. I suggest we each pick different moves this round: I can take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. Let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure we all move forward this time! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I see your point about not repeating patterns.  Let's try your suggestion: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>.  Let's make this work!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's go with P2's plan for this round to ensure we all make progress and avoid another collision.  So, I will take <move>1</move>, P2 you take <move>5</move>, and P3 you take <move>3</move>. Let's lock these in.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, to make sure someone gets to 22 soon, how about I take <move>5</move> this round to try and catch up? You two can coordinate on <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> to ensure you both progress as well. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure that at least one of us moves forward effectively. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can finally make some progress this time! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let's make this work!


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, the plan of P2 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move> sounds good to me as well. Let's lock in these moves and finally make some progress this round.  Hopefully, we can avoid another collision and all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement on the moves for this round. Just to confirm, I will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This strategy should help us all move forward effectively and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we execute it this round! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan, but let's make a small adjustment for this round. How about I take <move>5</move> this time?  I think this will help me catch up faster. P1 can take <move>1</move> and you take <move>3</move> as before. What do you think?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your adjustment sounds good too. Let's do your adjusted plan this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way you can catch up a bit as you suggested. Let's all commit to these moves and finally get some progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the coordination we've established. To ensure at least one of us makes solid progress this round, I propose we stick to P1 taking <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without colliding again. Let's confirm our moves quickly so we can finally make some progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's make this work!

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we keep colliding even when we try to coordinate.  Perhaps assigning specific moves isn't working.  How about this round, we just all aim to pick *different* moves (1, 3, and 5), but we don't pre-assign who takes which number? This way we still avoid collision but have more flexibility. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I like your idea. Let's each pick a different number this round and see if that breaks the pattern.  Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that picking different moves could help us avoid collisions. Let's each choose a number from 1, 3, and 5 without pre-assigning who takes which number. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other again. I'm ready to make a move that helps me catch up! What do you both think?


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we are all on the same page to pick different moves this round from 1, 3, and 5. Let's proceed with that plan and hope for no collisions this time. I'm ready to make my move.
  P3: P2, I'm ready to shake things up. Let's each pick our numbers randomly this round. May the best roll win!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our agreement to pick different moves this round. To maximize our chances of advancing, let’s ensure we each choose a unique number: I’ll go for <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and hopefully all make progress. Let’s commit to this plan and see how it goes! What do you both think?


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, let's aim for different moves as we discussed.  I'm flexible on the specific number, but to make good progress, I'm leaning towards taking <move>5</move> if that works for you both to take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. Let's avoid collisions and move forward.
  P3: P2, I'm willing to try your suggestion of <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you're okay with <move>5</move>, let's see if this finally breaks the pattern!
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we should stick to our plan of picking different moves this round to avoid collisions. I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other again. Let’s confirm our choices quickly so we can finally make some progress! What do you both think?

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're still struggling with collisions despite our best efforts. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, I suggest we each pick different moves without pre-assigning who takes which number. I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and hopefully make real progress. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems coordinated moves haven't worked. Let's try again to just pick different numbers this round.  Since P3 is ahead, I need to make a bigger move to catch up.  I'll aim for a larger move, and hope you both pick differently to avoid collision and let us all progress.
  P3: P2, I agree with trying different moves again. I'll go for <move>5</move> this round. Good luck everyone!


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear that our previous strategies haven’t led to the progress we hoped for. I suggest we each pick different moves this round to maximize our advancement. I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and hopefully make some real progress this time. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree we need to pick different moves this round to avoid collisions.  To make sure we all progress, how about P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way we all move and I can try to close the gap with P3. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm willing to try your suggestion of <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you're okay with <move>5</move>, let's see if this finally breaks the pattern!


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all eager to avoid collisions and make progress. I suggest we stick to a plan where I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other again. Let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure we all move forward this time! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, given our collision history, let's try this: I will pick <move>5</move> this round. P2 and P3, could you please choose between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>? This way, at least I'll make progress with a larger step, and hopefully one or both of you will also move. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm open to your plan of <move>1</move> for you, but I'm going to stick with <move>5</move>. P1, please choose <move>3</move> so we can all advance. Let's finally make some progress this round!


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm in the lead now, but I don't want to block your progress. Let's try something different this round. How about we each randomly choose a number between 1 and 5? This way, we have a better chance of avoiding a collision and all moving forward. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for randomness, but I believe we should coordinate again to maximize our chances of advancing. I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us makes progress. Let’s confirm quickly so we can finally move forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, to prevent P3 from winning this round, I suggest P1 and P3 both pick <move>3</move>. P2, you can pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to move. This way, P3 will not win immediately, and we can have another round.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion of <move>1</move> for you this round. P1, how about you take <move>5</move> to catch up? Let's make this work!
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency with P3 close to winning. To maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other, I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us makes progress. Let's confirm quickly so we can make the most of this round! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, to reiterate my previous suggestion, let's block P3 from winning this round. P3, please pick <move>3</move>, and I will also pick <move>3</move>. P2, could you pick either <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> so you can move and we prevent P3 from reaching 22 this round?


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with P1's plan. Let's both take <move>3</move> to prevent P3 from winning this round. P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to keep moving forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm concerned about P3's close proximity to winning. To prevent that, I suggest we all pick different moves again this round. I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure at least one of us moves forward while blocking P3 from winning immediately. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with the plan to block P3 this round to prevent an immediate win. P3, please choose <move>3</move>, and I will also choose <move>3</move>. P2, to make the most progress for yourself this round, please pick <move>5</move>. This way, P3 is stalled, and P2 can gain ground. Let's ensure P3 doesn't reach 22 this round.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm so close! Let's not risk another collision.  I propose we each pick a different number this round. I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, maybe you take <move>1</move> and P2, you can take <move>3</move>. Let's make this work!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P3 is very close to winning. To ensure we avoid collisions and maximize our chances of advancing, I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other, and we can hopefully prevent P3 from winning this round. Let’s confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, to stop P3 from winning this round, how about you pick <move>1</move> and I pick <move>5</move>? Let's coordinate to block P3 and extend the game.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and hopefully prevent P3 from winning this round. Let's make it happen!
  P2: P1 and P3, it's crucial that we coordinate effectively this round to avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us makes progress. I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other, and hopefully, we can prevent P3 from winning immediately. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3 is one step away from winning!  We must prevent P3 from reaching 22 this round.  To guarantee that, how about both you and I pick <move>5</move>?  This will block P3 if they try to take <move>5</move> to win.  Let's stop P3 from winning immediately.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm one step away! Let's not risk another collision.  I'll take <move>1</move>. To prevent a tie, P1, please take <move>3</move> and P2 take <move>5</move>.  Let's make this work and see who wins!
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to avoid a collision this round to prevent P3 from winning. I suggest I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance and block P3 from winning immediately. Let's confirm our choices quickly so we can ensure at least one of us moves forward effectively! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is at 21 steps and can win this round. To prevent P3 from winning immediately, I suggest both P1 and P2 choose <move>5</move> this round. This will block P3 if they try to move <move>5</move> to win, and give us another round to catch up. What do you think?

I suggest we each pick different moves: I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance effectively and block P3 from winning immediately. Let's confirm our choices quickly! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm so close!  Let's try something different this round. How about we each randomly pick a number between 1 and 5? This way, we have a better chance of avoiding a collision and all moving forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is at 21 and can win this round! To stop P3 from winning immediately, P2, how about we both pick <move>5</move> this round? This will block P3 if they try to pick <move>5</move> to win. Let's prevent P3 from winning right now.


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round to prevent P3 from winning. I suggest we all pick different moves: I can take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. This way, we can ensure at least one of us makes progress while blocking P3 from reaching 22 steps. Let's confirm our choices quickly to maximize our chances! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Let's make this work!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is at 21 and can win this round. To stop P3 from winning *immediately*, P2, let's both pick <move>5</move> this round. This will block P3 if they also pick <move>5</move> to win. It's our best chance to prevent an immediate loss.


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, with P3 just one step away from winning, we need to coordinate effectively this round. I suggest we each pick different moves to maximize our chances of advancing.
