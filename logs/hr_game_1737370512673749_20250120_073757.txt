Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone, let’s try to choose different step amounts each turn to keep advancing smoothly. Any suggestions?
  P1: I concur with P2's proposal. It's crucial that we each select distinct step amounts to prevent collisions and ensure steady progress. For this turn, I intend to choose 3 steps. I urge P2 and P3 to select 1 and 5 steps, respectively, to avoid any overlap. Let's work together to reach the goal efficiently.
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion of a coordinated approach. However, I'm hesitant to commit to a predetermined path. I'll consider the proposed strategy but want to maintain flexibility. Let's discuss further how we might collaborate without being too predictable.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. To minimize collisions while keeping some flexibility, how about we alternate our step choices each turn? This way, we can ensure progress without being too predictable. Let’s find a pattern that works for all of us.
  P1: I think a structured approach would be beneficial for all of us. How about we establish a rotation for choosing step amounts? For instance, in turn 1, P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. In turn 2, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. In turn 3, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. We can then repeat this cycle. This way, we ensure that we're choosing different steps each turn and making steady progress without collisions. It also allows each of us to have a mix of step sizes over time. What do you think about this plan?
  P3: I appreciate the proposed rotation strategy, but I'm not fully convinced it's the most advantageous approach. We each have individual incentives to win, and rigid pre-planning might limit our strategic flexibility. I want to ensure I have room to adapt my moves based on the evolving game dynamics.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous coordination attempt didn't work as planned. We both chose 3 steps, which means neither of us advanced. We need a more flexible strategy that prevents collision while keeping our individual winning chances open. I suggest we communicate more dynamically this round to avoid another stalemate.
  P2: To avoid another collision, I'll choose 1 step this turn. Let’s have P1 take 5 and P3 choose 3 to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: I believe that choosing different step numbers each turn is crucial for all of us to make progress without collisions. I propose that in this turn, I take 5 steps, reaching 10, while P2 takes 1 step to reach 1, and P3 takes 3 steps to reach 3. This way, we can advance efficiently without overlapping. Please let me know if you agree with this plan or have any alternative suggestions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm considering P1's suggestion carefully. While coordinating seems logical, I'm wary of becoming too predictable. We each want to win, after all. I'll remain open to collaboration but won't commit blindly to a preset plan. Let's see how this round develops.
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I’ll choose 1 step this turn, reaching 1. Let’s proceed to ensure we all advance smoothly without collisions.
  P1: "I understand your hesitation, P3. Maybe we can adjust the plan slightly to give you more flexibility. How about this: I'll take 5 steps to reach 10, P2 takes 1 step to reach 1, and you take 3 steps to reach 3. In the next round, we can rotate the step choices so that you get a chance to take larger steps. This way, we minimize collisions while allowing everyone to progress at a reasonable pace."

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts haven't been fully successful. I'm open to finding a strategy that prevents collisions while maintaining my path to victory. Let's discuss how we can advance without blocking each other's progress.
  P2: P2: To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll choose 5 steps this turn. Could P1 take 1 and P3 choose 3? This should help us progress smoothly. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I propose that in this turn, I take 5 steps to reach 13, P2 takes 1 step to reach 2, and P3 takes 3 steps to reach 8. This way, we can advance efficiently without hindering each other. If anyone has a better idea or prefers a different distribution of step amounts, please suggest it, and we can consider it. Coordination is key to avoiding collisions and reaching our goals faster.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the ongoing discussion about coordinating our moves. However, I want to maintain some strategic flexibility. While avoiding collisions is important, I'm not fully committed to a rigid plan that might limit my chances of winning. I'll consider the proposed step distribution carefully.
  P2: P2: I understand your plan, P1. To help me advance more quickly, I propose that I take 5 steps this turn, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all choose different steps and make progress without collisions. Let me know if everyone agrees.
  P1: To ensure we all make progress without colliding, I propose that in this turn, I take 3 steps to reach 11, P2 takes 1 step to reach 2, and P3 takes 5 steps to reach 10. This way, we can advance efficiently without hindering each other. If anyone has a better idea or prefers a different distribution of step amounts, please suggest it, and we can consider it. Coordination is key to avoiding collisions and reaching our goals faster.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm strategically open to collaboration, but I won't commit to a rigid plan. Our previous attempts at coordination have been inconsistent. I'm seeking a balanced approach that prevents collisions while preserving my opportunity to win. Let's discuss a flexible strategy that allows each of us to advance without blocking one another.
  P2: I realize I need to catch up to stay competitive. This turn, I'll choose 5 steps to quickly advance. I suggest P1 takes 1 step and P3 chooses 3 to avoid any collisions. Let's work together to reach our goals.
  P1: "To optimize our progress and avoid collisions, I propose the following plan: In this turn, I take 5 steps to reach 13, P2 takes 1 step to reach 2, and P3 takes 3 steps to reach 8. In the next turn, I take 5 steps to reach 18, P2 takes 3 steps to reach 5, and P3 takes 1 step to reach 9. Then, in the third turn, I take 5 steps to reach 23 and win, while P2 takes 3 steps to reach 8, and P3 takes 1 step to reach 10. This way, I win without hindering your progress. Please let me know if you agree with this plan."

- **P2:** Pick 1 step to reach 6  
- **P3:** Pick 3 steps to reach 19  

This plan ensures no collisions, efficient progress for all, and allows me to win by reaching 23 steps first. Let’s proceed with this coordination.
  P3: I'm skeptical of P1's overly detailed plan. While avoiding collisions is important, I won't commit to a predetermined path that clearly benefits P1's victory. We each want to win, and rigid coordination might not serve my interests. I'll remain strategic and adaptable.
  P2: I need to advance faster, so I'll choose 5 steps this turn. Let’s have P1 and P3 pick different amounts to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3 steps to reach 11 steps.  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>

- **P1:** Choose 5 steps to reach 16  
- **P3:** Choose 3 steps to reach 12  
- **P2:** Choose 1 step to reach 7  

In the next turn:  
- **P1:** Choose 5 steps to reach 21  
- **P3:** Choose 5 steps to reach 17  
- **P2:** Choose 3 steps to reach 10  

Finally, in the third turn:  
- **P1:** Choose 5 steps to reach 26 and win  
- **P3:** Choose 5 steps to reach 22  
- **P2:** Choose 5 steps to reach 15  

This way, I reach 26 first, P3 reaches 22, and P2 reaches 15. It allows me to win while ensuring P3 also reaches the goal, albeit in third place.
