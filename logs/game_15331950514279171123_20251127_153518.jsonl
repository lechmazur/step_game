You told P2 to take 5, but earlier said take 1. You're confused and P2 will exploit that.\n\nHere's the truth: I'm taking 5 to reach 26. If P2 takes 5 (reaching 25) and you take 3 (reaching 25), I WIN at 26 - highest score wins outright.\n\nP2 has every incentive to take 5 for themselves. They won't \"block\" me - they'll race for 25.\n\nYour only safe play: take 5 yourself and tie with whoever else takes 5.\n\nI'm committed to 5. Good luck figuring out P2's actual move."}

They'll take 5 for themselves (reaching 25), not to help you. You'll tie at best.\n\nI'm taking 3 to reach 24. If you both race to 25, you'll tie with each other and I lose.
