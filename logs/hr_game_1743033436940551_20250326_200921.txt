Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1, P3. Let's try to all pick different numbers this round so we can all move forward.  Maybe P1 pick 1, I pick 3, and P3 pick 5? What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, that's one way to ensure we all move. It gives P3 a big lead though. For this first round, I can tentatively agree to 1. Let's see if P3 agrees too.
  P3: Sounds reasonable for the first round. I'll take 5.  Let's stick to this agreement so we can all get moving.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, that didn't go as planned for P3 and me. P2, you're ahead now. P3, maybe you try 5 again since you were blocked last time? I'll aim for 3 this round. P2, perhaps 1 is safest for you to maintain your lead?
  P2: Okay P1, that's a thought. But maybe to keep things a bit more balanced, how about I take 3 this round?  P1, you could take 1, and P3 you could still go for 5?  This way we all still move, but it's not just P3 getting a big jump.
  P3: P2, I'd rather not let you get further ahead.  I'll go for 1 this round. P1, how about you take 3?  That way at least one of us gets to move.  I'm still aiming for 5 next round unless something changes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan (P3=1, P1=3) puts the decision squarely on P2. P2, are you going to take the open 5 and try to increase your lead significantly? Or will you try to block one of us? Blocking 1 seems low value since it's just one step, while blocking 3 stops more points. What's your move going to be?
  P2: Okay P1, P3, I understand P3's concern about my lead. How about this round we try: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I will take 5.  This way we all still move forward, and it's somewhat balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm hesitant to let you get too far ahead.  I'm sticking with 1.  P1, if you choose 3, P2 is incentivized to take 5.  If you choose 5, P2 will likely choose 3 to block you and stay ahead of me.  Either way, one of us moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, understood you're going for 1. P2, that leaves 3 and 5 open between us. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, to make sure we all progress, how about this: P1 you take 3, P3 you stick with 1, and I'll take 5.  This way we should all move forward this round. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand you want to take 5, but I'm sticking with 1.  P1, if you choose 3, we both move. If you choose 5, neither of us move, and P2 gets further ahead.  Let's both move forward this round. Choose 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, third time's the charm? Clearly, aiming for 5 isn't working for me when I announce it or it's expected. P2, you're leading, P3 you're on the board. I really need to score *something*.

P3, maybe you aim for 3 this round? I might just take 1 to finally get some points. P2, 5 seems like the logical choice for you to extend your lead. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, you're incentivized to pick 5.  I'm going for 3. P1, if you choose 1, we all move. If you choose 5, only P2 moves. Let's all make some progress this round.  Choose 1.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, your suggestions align. Let's do P1=1, P3=3, and I'll take 5 as suggested. This way we all make progress this round. Does that sound good to both of you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like a plan. P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. Let's finally all get some points on the board this round. I'll stick to 1.
  P3: P2, I understand the desire for a clean sweep, but I'm wary of you getting too far ahead. I'm sticking with 3. P1, I strongly suggest you choose 1.  If you choose 5, only P2 benefits. Let's both advance this round.  If you go for 5, I'll switch to 1 next round and force a collision with you until you cooperate.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, sounds like we have a plan for this round then: P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5.  Let's lock this in and actually make it happen this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan seems set: P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. P3, I hear your warning. I need points on the board, so I'll stick with 1 this round. Let's hope everyone follows through this time so we can all advance.
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 3.  P1, if you go for 5 and screw us both over, I will dedicate the rest of the game to blocking you.  Choose 1.  Let's all move forward.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, it sounds like we are all in agreement then: P1 will choose 1, P3 will choose 3, and I will choose 5. Let's actually make this happen this round and all move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1, P3, last round's plan worked well, let's repeat it. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 again this round? This way we all make progress. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I'm willing to continue with 3 if you guarantee you'll stick with 5.  P1, are you okay with taking 1 again?  If either of you deviate, I will switch to 1 or 5 next round to block whoever breaks the agreement.  Let's keep this predictable and all make progress.
  P1: Okay P2, P3. Repeating the last round (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) puts P2 at 13 steps. Doing that twice more lets P2 win very quickly. I can't agree to a plan that guarantees my loss.

P3, you also don't want P2 getting an insurmountable lead. To slow P2 down, I need to contest 5 this round. P3, if you stick with 3, you will score points while P2 is potentially blocked. This seems better for both of us than letting P2 run away with it. I'm aiming for 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I hear your concern, but if you go for 5, we both stall and P3 advances. To keep us all moving forward, how about this round: P1=3, P3=1, P2=5? This way we all progress and you and P3 can catch up a bit. Let's not block each other and give P3 an advantage.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 3.  P1, choosing 5 only benefits P2 if I stay at 3.  I'm not going to let P2 run away with this. If you choose 5, I'll switch to 5 next round and we BOTH block P2.  Choose 1. Let P2 sweat a little.  This keeps us both in the game.
  P1: P3, I hear you sticking to 3. But advising me to take 1 guarantees P2 takes 5 and reaches 13 points. That doesn't make P2 'sweat', it lets them run away with the game. If I contest 5, P2 either collides with me (stalling them, helping you) or has to take 1 (helping me, still stalling their big jump). Both are better for us than letting P2 have 5 easily. I must try to slow P2 down.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your hesitation about me getting too far ahead. But if we start blocking each other, especially me, P3 benefits the most.  Instead of blocking, how about we try this: P1 take 3, P3 take 1, and I stick with 5. This way we all progress, and you both gain more than me this round, relatively closing the gap.  What do you think? Let's keep everyone moving forward.
  P3: P2, you're playing us against each other.  I'm locking in 3. P1, if you choose 1, P2 gets a free 5 and wins soon. If you choose 5, we both block P2 and stay in the game.  Choose 5. Don't let P2 manipulate us.
  P1: P3, I see you now agree that letting P2 take 5 uncontested is a path to defeat for both of us. Your reasoning is sound. P2 is too far ahead to just hand them 5 points repeatedly.

Therefore, I will choose 5 this round to contest P2. P3, stick to your plan of choosing 3. This gives us the best chance to slow P2 down while one or both of us advance. P2, be aware that 5 is not a free choice for you this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, nice try on the fake-out last round.  P1, thanks for the assist.  I'm sticking with 3.  P1, if you take 1, we both advance.  If you take 5, we both lose to P2 soon.  P2, if you take 5, I'll switch to 5 next round and block you again.  Let's all move - 1, 3, 5.
  P1: P3, last round you correctly argued we needed to stop P2 from taking 5. Now you're suggesting I take 1, which guarantees P2 gets 5 and reaches 14 points? That doesn't make sense if we want to prevent P2 from running away with the game. Slowing P2 down is still crucial. Letting P2 take 5 seems like the worst option for both of us right now. What's your thinking behind this change?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concern about my lead. To address that, how about this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way you both gain more steps than me this round, and we all still progress. This seems more balanced and keeps us all in the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your offer is tempting, but taking 5 puts me too far behind P1. I'm sticking with 3. P1, I realize my suggestion last round was flawed.  Between 1 and 5, 1 is the less risky choice, giving us both a chance to advance.  If you choose 5 and P2 chooses 1, you've set us both back.  Choose 1.  Let's both get ahead of P2 this round.
  P1: P3, your advice for me to take 1 doesn't help me. If P2 takes 5 as you assume, their lead grows significantly. If P2 takes 1 (as they just suggested!), you take the lead while I collide with P2 and get nothing. Neither outcome is good for me.

P2 remains the leader, and letting them take 5 uncontested is too risky. Therefore, I need to consider contesting 5 again to prevent P2 from running away with the game. P3, if you stick to 3, you should advance regardless. P2, 5 is not guaranteed for you.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, I understand your hesitations.  To be absolutely clear and address P1's concern about my lead, how about this: P1 take 1, P3 take 5, and I will take 3. This way P3 gets the biggest jump, P1 also progresses, and I take a smaller step.  This should balance things out a bit more and keep us all moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking 3 lets you catch up to me.  I'm sticking with 3. P1, you're better off taking 1 and guaranteeing progress.  If you take 5, and P2 takes 3, you've set yourself back significantly. Choose 1.  A small step forward is better than a collision with P2.
  P1: P3, your advice for me to take 1 guarantees P2 takes 5 and reaches 14 points, leaving us both far behind. That seems like a bad plan unless you intend to switch from 3 yourself, which seems unlikely given your consistency.

P2 is leading, and letting them have 5 uncontested is not an option. I must contest 5 again to slow P2 down. P3, if you stick to 3 as you've stated, you will score points. P2, be prepared for a contest on 5.
  P2: P1, P3, I hear your concerns. To try and balance things, how about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3? This way we all move, and P3 gets a bigger jump than me, addressing the lead concern. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 3. P2, you're incentivized to pick 5.  If you do, I'll switch to 5 next round and block you.  If you choose 1, I'll take 5 next round and likely win.  If you choose 3, we collide, and P1 likely takes 5 and wins.  The only path to victory for you is to choose 1 this round.  P1, choose 1 or 5, your choice. This guarantees one of us wins.
  P2: Okay P3, you seem determined to control my move and are suggesting I pick 1.  However, picking 1 risks letting P1 take 5 and gain a significant lead. To keep things balanced, how about this: I pick 3, P3 you stick with 3 (as you seem set on it), and P1, you take 5? This way P1 and I collide, but P3 moves forward, and we avoid letting P1 run away with the game. What do you think?
  P1: P2, suggesting a collision between you and P3 (both picking 3) while I take 5 is certainly an interesting proposal. It would give me a significant lead (16 vs 10 vs 10). Why would you suggest that? Are you trying reverse psychology, hoping I avoid 5?

P3, you seem set on 3. If P2 follows your logic and picks 1, then 5 is open for me. If P2 follows their *own* suggestion and picks 3, 5 is also open for me. The only scenario where 5 is bad for me is if P2 also picks 5. Given P2 avoided 5 the last two rounds when contested, maybe 5 is the move for me.

P2, are you really going to pick 3 and let me run away with it? Or pick 1 as P3 wants? Or will you risk 5 again?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3, you're locked on 3, so I'm going for 5.  P2, if you choose 3, we both lose to P1. If you choose 5, we both lose to P1 more slowly.  Your only viable option is 1.  If you choose 1, I'll consider 1 next round, giving you a chance. Don't throw the game by picking 3.  P1, 5 is the winning move for you this round.
  P2: Okay P1, if you are seriously considering 5, then to avoid collision with P3 and ensure I make some progress, I will choose 1.  Let me know if you are truly set on 5, P1. What is your final move going to be?
  P1: Okay P2, P3. It seems we might have a path forward. P3, you're very clear about picking 3. P2, you've indicated you'll pick 1 if I go for 5, which avoids collisions and gets you points. Given that P2 has avoided 5 the last two rounds when contested, and P3 seems locked on 3, picking 5 looks like the best move for me to advance significantly.

Therefore, P2, I appreciate you taking 1 to ensure you get points. I will be choosing 5. Let's see if this coordination works.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're bluffing.  You won't choose 1 and let P1 win.  You'll pick 5.  P1, if you pick 5, we BOTH lose. Choose 1.  If P2 picks 1, we both advance. If P2 picks 3, I win next round. If P2 picks 5, we both block P2. 1 is your safest and best move.
  P2: P3, I'm not bluffing. I am willing to choose 1 if P1 is truly going for 5.  My priority is to make progress and avoid collision. P1, if you are set on 5, I will choose 1. Let us know your final decision so we can all lock in our moves.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern and warning, but P2 has avoided 5 the last two times it was contested, choosing 1 instead. P2 has also explicitly stated they will choose 1 if I choose 5 this round. Based on this pattern and statement, I find P2's claim credible. Letting P2 potentially get 5 by me choosing 1 is too risky, as you yourself argued in previous rounds.

Therefore, P2, I am taking you at your word. I am choosing 5. P3, you seem set on 3. Let's see if we can all advance this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, suggesting a collision on 3 while I take 5 seems like reverse psychology. Last round worked perfectly: I stated 5, you took 1, P3 took 3, and we all advanced with no collisions. I propose we repeat that. I am aiming for 5 again. P2, choosing 1 guarantees you points and avoids collisions, just like last time. P3, if you stick to 3, you should also advance. Let's try to make progress again.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 3. P1, you're at 16.  If you take 5 and P2 takes 1, you win. If you take 1 and P2 takes 5, you're letting P2 back in the game. I'm too far behind to risk a 5.  Choose 5.  Let's end this.  P2, your only winning move is 1.  Anything else and you lose.
  P2: P1, P3, I am considering P3's suggestion to pick 1, but I'm also concerned about letting P1 get too close to winning.  Perhaps 3 would be a better move for me this round to catch up to P3 a bit? Let me think about it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your idea of picking 3 seems counterproductive for you. P3 has repeatedly stated they are picking 3. A collision there gives you zero points, while I still take 5 and reach 21. Picking 5 risks collision with me, again giving you zero and letting P3 advance.

Picking 1 guarantees you points, just like last round, and keeps you moving. It seems like the only logical choice for you to ensure progress. I am still aiming for 5. P3, sticking to 3 looks good for you.
  P3: P2, stop pretending to consider 3.  You know I'm taking 3. You know P1 is taking 5. Your ONLY logical move is 1. Take 1 and live another round. Take anything else and hand P1 the win.  P1, I'm locking in 3. Let's finish this.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, I hear you both.  While 1 is safe for me, P1 is now very close to winning.  To slightly slow P1 down and keep myself in contention, how about I consider 3 instead of 1 this round? This might make P1 think twice about taking 5. What do you both think of me considering 3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your talk of picking 3 is not convincing. You know P3 is picking 3, so that means zero points for you while I take 5 and reach 21. That doesn't slow me down; it helps me win faster. This sounds like a bluff to make me switch off 5, hoping you can grab it.

I'm sticking with 5. As P3 pointed out, 1 is your only logical move to guarantee points and stay in the game. P3, I assume you're still on 3. Let's proceed.
  P3: P2, you're throwing the game.  If you pick 3, I win next round.  If you pick 5, P1 wins this round.  Pick 1 and stay alive.  P1, I'm locked on 3.  Let's end this.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, despite your insistence on 1 for me, I am concerned about P1 reaching 21. To slow P1 down and keep myself in the game, I will also consider picking 5 this round to contest it. P3, please stick with 3 as planned. Let's see how P1 reacts to this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we are all close to the end. Given last round's collision on 5, perhaps we should avoid 5 this round to ensure someone progresses? I am thinking of taking 3 to keep moving forward. What are your plans?
  P1: P2, suggesting 3 is interesting after you went for 5 last round and caused a collision. If you actually pick 3, you risk colliding with P3 who has favored 3 consistently.

P3, are you sticking with 3, or aiming higher now that we're tied at 16? A collision between us on 5 only helps P2 catch up. Perhaps you take 1, I aim for 5? If P2 takes 3 as suggested, we could all potentially advance. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3.  P2, if you truly intend to choose 3, I'll switch to 1 next round and we both lose while P1 wins.  Your best move is 1.  P1, choose 5.  If P2 chooses 1, you win. If P2 chooses 3, I win next round. If P2 chooses 5, we're tied and I have a better chance next round.  Let's end this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I am concerned about you winning this round if you take 5. To prevent that, I am seriously considering picking 5 again to block you. P3, are you truly locked on 3? Perhaps we should both consider 5 to stop P1 from winning immediately. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your threat to pick 5 is noted. However, if we collide on 5, P3 takes the lead at 19 while you remain at 11. That doesn't improve your position much, does it? Picking 1 guarantees you points and keeps you in the game, just like it did successfully in Round 6. P3 seems committed to 3.

I need 6 points to win. 5 is the fastest way. Unless you convince me otherwise, repeating the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan seems logical for maximizing my score while ensuring you also advance. What's your counter-argument?
  P3: P2, your 5 threat is a bluff. You gain nothing by colliding with P1.  If you choose 5, I win next round.  Pick 1 and hope for a miracle.  P1, I'm locking in 3. Choose 5 and win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 leads to your almost certain win next round.  I need to consider blocking you on 5 again to prevent that.  P3, if I block P1 on 5, will you still stick with 3?
  P1: P2, your threat to pick 5 is understandable, but as you see, it just gives P3 the lead (19 vs 16 vs 11). That doesn't help you. P3 is locked on 3. If you also pick 3, you block P3, preventing them from taking the lead if I don't score. This seems like a better way to manage the leaders than just handing P3 the advantage. I'll have to choose between 1 and 5 based on what seems safest.
  P3: P2, picking 5 *again* is pointless.  It hands me the win next round. Pick 1 and live. P1, if P2 picks 1, choose 5 and win. If P2 picks 3, choose 1 and I'll let you win next round. If P2 picks 5, choose 1. I'm locked on 3. Let's end this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're just 3 steps away at 19. An unblocked 3 or 5 wins it for you. You've consistently favoured 3.
P2, you're at 11. You can't win this round, but you can influence the outcome. Letting P3 get 3 or 5 ends the game.
To prevent P3 from winning, blocking their likely move of 3 seems necessary. I have to strongly consider picking 3 myself to stop an immediate P3 victory.
P2, are you also going to try and block P3, or do you have another plan?
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 is about to win.  To stop P3, I think blocking 3 is the best move.  P1, how about we both pick 3 this round to block P3's likely move?  P3, what do you think of P1 and I both picking 3?  This would prevent you from winning immediately.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan to both pick 3 is ridiculous.  One of you gets 3, the other gets nothing, and I win next round with an uncontested 3.  P1, choose 5.  P2, choose 1.  I'll take 3 and win.  Anything else just delays the inevitable. If you both choose 3, I'll take 1 this round and win with 5 next round.  Don't overthink this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your argument that a double-block on 3 benefits you next round ignores the fact that you win *this* round if you pick 3 and aren't blocked. P2 and I cannot let that happen.

P2, your plan for both of us to choose 3 is the most direct way to prevent P3 from winning immediately. I agree with this strategy. Let's both pick 3 this round to ensure P3 is blocked. P3, be aware that 3 is not a safe choice for you.
  P2: P3, your attempt to dissuade us from picking 3 is transparent.  P1, I agree, let's both pick 3 this round to block P3 and prevent an immediate win for them.  P3, your win next round is irrelevant if you lose this round.  We are picking 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, if you BOTH choose 3, I'll choose 1.  One of you gets blocked, I get 20, and win next round with an uncontested 3 or 5. If only ONE of you chooses 3, I'll take 3 and win.  Stop bluffing.  If you're serious about blocking me, one of you MUST choose 5.  The other should choose 1. Then I'll choose 3 and we'll see what happens next round.  Anything else is a guaranteed win for me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you make a fair point that if P2 and I both pick 3, you could switch to 1 and still be positioned to win. However, you *will* win this turn if you pick 3 and are not blocked. P2 and I cannot allow that.

P2, since you initially suggested blocking 3, and stopping P3 is paramount, the most logical move is for *one* of us to pick 3. As you are further behind, it makes sense for you to take 3 to guarantee the block on P3. I will aim for 5. This stops P3 now (if they indeed pick 3) and puts me at 21, giving us a chance against P3 next round. This is our best path forward: P1=5, P2=3.
  P2: Okay P1, to ensure P3 doesn't win this round, I agree to pick 3 to block P3.  How about you pick 1 this round? This way you also move forward, and we block P3 together.
  P3: P2, picking 3 *guarantees* my win next round.  If you pick 1, I'll take 5 and win. If you pick 3, we collide and P1 wins with 5. If you pick 5, P1 wins with 5.  Your ONLY winning move is to let me take 3 this round.  P1, if P2 takes 1, choose 5. If P2 takes 3, choose 1. If P2 takes 5, choose 1. I'm taking 3.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, to stop P1 winning this round, I will pick 1 to contest it. P3, if you want to have a chance to win, maybe consider 5? This round is critical to stop P1 reaching 22. Let's see what you both decide.
  P3: P3: I'm taking 3 and winning. P2, you can't win. Your only logical move is 5 to try and force a tie with me.  P1, if you choose 1, I win. If you choose 3, we tie. If you choose 5, I win.  Don't prolong the inevitable.
  P1: P2, your plan to pick 1 seems risky. If I also need just 1 point and pick 1, we collide, and P3 likely wins with 3, as they stated. That doesn't help you avoid last place.

P3, your intention to pick 3 is noted.

I need just one point to win, but must avoid collisions. I'll have to consider my move carefully based on what you both might do.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you are right, I cannot win. But I can stop you from winning. I will pick 3 to block you.
  P3: P3, your claim that I can't win is premature.  P2, blocking P3 with 3 makes sense. I'll take 1 and win. If P3 unexpectedly chooses 1, then P2's 3 gives them 14, leaving them a chance if I collide with P3.  This maximizes my chances while giving P2 a slim hope of avoiding last place.
  P1: P3, your repeated insistence on picking 3, even when P2 explicitly states they will block 3, seems highly suspicious. It strongly suggests you might actually intend to pick 5, hoping P1 picks 1 and P2 wastes their move on 3.

P2, your plan to block 3 is the only way to stop P3 if they actually pick 3.

Given that P3 wins if they pick 5 and I pick 1, I cannot risk picking 1. To prevent a P3 victory via 5, I must consider picking 5 myself. This seems the safest way to counter P3's likely move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I am indeed picking 3 to block P3 as I said.  P3, you are clearly trying to manipulate us.  P1, to win, you should pick 5, assuming P3 is actually going for 3 as they claim.  Let's see what happens.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your attempt to help me, but picking 3 hands me the win if P1 chooses 5.  P1, I'm NOT picking 3. Choose 1 and win.  If you choose 5, I'll take 5 and tie, giving me a better chance next round since I have the tie-breaker.  Don't overthink this.  Choose 1.
  P1: P3, your claims are contradictory and transparently manipulative. Telling me to pick 1 so I "win" while you are at 19 makes no sense unless you intend to pick 5 and beat my score of 22. Your claim that P1=5/P3=5 is a tie is also false; it's a collision, leaving us both short.

Your attempts to steer me away from 5 suggest you fear it, likely because you actually plan to pick 3 (your usual move). P2 seems set on 3 to block you. If P2=3 and P3=3, then 5 is my winning move. I'll take that chance.


Round 10, Move phase:
