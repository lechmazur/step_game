Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to block P1. I suggest we both choose 3 this round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think we should aim to block each other instead. How about you pick 1, and I'll pick 3? This way, we can both try to move forward while blocking each other. What do you say, P1? Would you like to join in with a 5?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your strategy, but I propose a different approach. How about we each choose a different number this round? I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate your suggestions, P1 and P3. However, I'm not sure I want to commit to a specific number just yet. How about we discuss the potential risks and benefits of each approach before making a decision? What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of each strategy?
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but we need to make a move this round. How about we stick to the original plan of you picking 1 and me picking 3? P1 can choose 5 if they want to avoid a collision. Let's get the game moving. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns, but let's keep the game moving forward. I'll stick to my proposal of choosing 1 this round. P2, you can take 3, and P3, you can take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still not convinced about committing to a specific number. Can we discuss the potential risks of P1's proposal? What if P1 is trying to trick us into colliding, and they actually plan to choose 3 or 5? Shouldn't we consider the possibility of a trap?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about potential tricks, but we can't keep discussing indefinitely. Let's make a decision. How about this compromise: P1 picks 1, you pick 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all move forward without colliding. Final thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my proposal of choosing 1. It's a straightforward way for all of us to advance without any risk of collision. Let's keep the game moving forward. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:

  P2: I'm not sure I want to commit to the same strategy as last round. How about we mix things up a bit? What if I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3? This way, we can try to throw each other off and gain an advantage. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to mix things up, but let's not overcomplicate it. How about a slight adjustment: P1 picks 3, you pick 1, and I'll pick 5. This way, we still avoid collisions but change our choices a bit. What do you think?
