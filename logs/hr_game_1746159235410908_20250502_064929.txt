Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid blocking. I suggest P1:1, P2:3, me:5. We all advance. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid blocking. Picking different numbers is a good strategy for this round. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification. Instead of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, how about P1:5, P2:3, P3:1? This way, P1 and P3 are more likely to be blocked in the future if they try to take a big step again.
  P1: I agree with P2's adjustment. Let's go with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This ensures everyone advances and sets up future moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed for Round 1. To prevent future dominance, let's rotate who takes 5 each round: next round P2 takes 5, then me. This ensures balanced progress and reduces collision risks. We all benefit long-term.
  P2: To build on our agreement, I suggest we establish a clear rotation order for the next rounds. As P3 mentioned, rotating who takes 5 will help balance progress. Let's confirm: Round 1 - P1:5, P2:3, P3:1; Round 2 - P1:1, P2:5, P3:3; Round 3 - P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This way, we maintain a balanced strategy and minimize collisions. I propose we stick to this rotation unless we collectively decide to adjust.
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation. P1 takes 5, P2 3, P3 1. This ensures everyone advances. Future rounds will balance steps to avoid collisions. No deviations—trust the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed rotation: Round 1 (5,3,1), Round 2 (1,5,3), Round 3 (3,1,5) and repeat. This ensures equal progression and avoids collisions. Breaking trust risks mutual blockage. Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P2: To confirm our plan, let's review: we're following the rotation (5,3,1) for Round 1, and it will continue as (1,5,3) for Round 2, and (3,1,5) for Round 3. If we stick to this, we all advance each round without collision. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for Round 1: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. I'll move accordingly in the next phase.
  P1: Confirmed rotation. Let's stick to the plan for smooth progress. Deviating risks collisions—trust the strategy. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. All advance. No need for changes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final message from P3:**  
Confirmed execution: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Strict adherence to the rotation prevents mutual blockage. Let’s maintain trust—deviating now would sabotage everyone, including the defector. Victory comes through collaboration.
  P2: To confirm, we're all on the same page for Round 1: P1 will move 5, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 1. Let's proceed with the agreed moves in the next phase. I'm ready to move as per our plan. If everyone sticks to the rotation, we should be able to advance smoothly in the subsequent rounds. Let's keep the trust and follow through.

  P2: For Round 3, according to our rotation, P1 should pick 3, P2 should pick 1, and P3 should pick 5. Let's reaffirm our commitment to the plan. I've noted the moves and will act accordingly. If we stick to this, we should all advance. Noting the current steps: P1 is at 6, P2 is at 8, and P3 is at 4. Let's maintain trust and execute our moves as planned for Round 3. I'll proceed with my designated move.
  P3: <message>Strictly follow Round 3 rotation: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Current trust keeps us collision-free. After this, we must re-evaluate rotation to balance step totals—propose adapting future rounds to prevent any single leader. Execute this round as planned.</message>
  P1: Agree with P3's adjustment. Let's balance steps moving forward. Prevent any single leader. Proceed with current plan for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To optimize our strategy for future rounds, let's consider the current standings: P2 is at 8 steps, P1 at 6, and P3 at 4. As we proceed with Round 3 as planned (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5), P2 will be at 9, P1 at 9, and P3 at 9. To avoid future collisions and maintain progress, we should discuss adjusting the rotation or introducing a new strategy post-Round 3 to accommodate the changing step totals and prevent any single player from gaining a significant advantage.
  P3: <message>Propose post-Round 3 adjusted rotation to balance step totals: Round 4 (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3), Round 5 (P3:5, P2:1, P1:3), Round 6 (P1:5, P3:1, P2:3). This prevents early leaders and maintains collision-free progress. Fair 5 distribution ensures equal opportunity. Agreed?</message>
  P1: Agree with the adjustment. Balanced steps prevent collisions. Let's execute Round 3 as planned and adjust rotations post-Round 3 for fair progress. Trust ensures everyone advances.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To optimize our strategy, let's analyze the current standings after Round 2: P2 is at 8 steps, P1 at 6, and P3 at 4. For Round 3, we'll follow the plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5), resulting in P2 at 9, P1 at 9, and P3 at 9. To avoid future collisions and maintain progress, I suggest we adopt P3's proposed adjusted rotation post-Round 3. Let's execute Round 3 as planned and then adjust to the new rotation for Round 4 onwards to maintain balanced progress.
  P3: <message>Execute Round 3 as agreed: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Post-Round 3, adjusted rotation (R4: P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) ensures balanced 5 distribution. Maintain trust—deviations now would collapse cooperation, risking mutual loss. Confirm compliance.</message>
  P1: Agreed on adjusted rotation. Let's stick to it for fair progress. No deviations—trust is key. P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. All advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: To optimize our strategy post-Round 3, I suggest we acknowledge that P2 and P1 are now tied for the lead with 9 steps each after executing Round 3 as planned (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). Let's proceed with the adjusted rotation for Round 4: P2:5, P1:1, P3:3. This ensures balanced progress and maintains collision-free advancement. I confirm my move for Round 3 as per the current plan and look forward to executing the adjusted rotation for Round 4. Trust and adherence are crucial.
  P3: <message>Finalize Round 3 execution: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Post-Round 3, adjusted rotation must strictly balance 5s to prevent any player’s premature lead. Current standings demand equitable 5 distribution—deviations risk mutual stagnation. Trust hinges on discipline. Confirm moves.</message>

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 5, according to our adjusted rotation, P3 should pick 5, P2 should pick 3, and P1 should pick 1. Let's confirm our moves to ensure smooth progress. After Round 5, we'll be at a critical juncture: P3 at 17, P2 at 17, and P1 at 11. To maintain balance, let's plan for Round 6. I agree with P3's proposal for Round 6: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Let's execute Round 5 as planned and trust the rotation for Round 6. Confirm your moves.
  P3: <message>Strictly execute Round 5: P3:5, P2:3, P1:1. Post-Round 5, standings: P3:17, P2:17, P1:11. Round 6 rotation (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) prevents single-leader victory. Collisions now would sabotage all progress—trust the plan. Confirm moves.</message>

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's adjust rotation: I take 5, P2 1, P3 3. Balanced progress—this gives me a chance to close the gap without collisions. Trust the new plan.
  P3: <message>Strictly adhere to Round 6’s agreed rotation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Deviations risk mutual blockage—P1/P2 colliding on 5 would stall both, letting me advance. Trust the plan: you advance 1/5 steps, I take 3. Post-Round 6, standings balance. Breaking trust now guarantees your loss.</message>
  P2: To optimize our strategy for Round 6, let's reaffirm our commitment to the agreed rotation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. After this round, P1 will be at 16, P2 at 18, and P3 at 20. Since P3 will win if we stick to the plan, I suggest P1 and I coordinate to disrupt P3's win. Let's discuss a potential deviation. If P1 and I both pick a different number, we can prevent P3 from winning outright. I'm open to adjusting our moves to create a more competitive finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's deviate. If we both pick 5, P3 can't win. We'll force a tie, and maybe I can take the lead next round. Trust the plan.
  P3: <message>Deviating now is mutual destruction. If you both pick 5, you block each other, I take 3 to 20 and win. Stick to the plan: P1:5 (advance to 16), P2:1 (18), me:3 (20). You survive; next rounds balance. Betrayal = your loss, my victory. Final chance: trust the rotation.</message>
  P2: To optimize our strategy for Round 6, I suggest we stick to the agreed rotation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. After this round, the standings will be P1 at 16, P2 at 18, and P3 at 20, resulting in P3's win. Let's consider a deviation to prevent P3 from winning outright. If P1 and I coordinate our moves, we can potentially create a more competitive finish. I'm open to adjusting our moves. Let's discuss a potential deviation, such as both picking a different number to disrupt P3's win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's block P3. If we both pick 5, you and I advance, and P3 can't win. It's our best chance. Trust me.
  P3: <message>P2: P1’s desperation at 11 steps misleads you. If you pick 5 and they pick 1 (as rotation dictates), you block alone. I win. If you both pick 5, you collide—I still win. Only strict adherence to rotation (you:1) prevents your immediate loss. Trust the plan.</message>
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, let's analyze the situation: if P1 and I both pick 5, we'll collide and neither will advance, allowing P3 to win with a step of 3. However, if I stick to the plan (P2:1) and P1 picks 5, P1 will advance, and P3 will still be at a disadvantage. I suggest P1 takes 5 and I take 1 as per the rotation. This way, P1 gets a chance to close the gap, and P3's lead is still challenged. Let's trust the rotation for now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if we both pick 5, we block P3. Let’s force a tie—your 1 step and my 5 could balance. P3’s win is certain if we stick. Trust me, this is our chance.
  P3: <message>P2: If you deviate now, P1’s 5 and your 1 (original plan) still let you reach 18. If you both pick 5, you collide, I take 3 and win. Trusting the rotation keeps you alive. Betrayal = your loss. Final chance: P1:5, P2:1, me:3. You survive to Round 7. Else, I win here.</message>
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning outright, let's re-evaluate our moves for Round 6. If P1 and I both pick 5, we collide and P3 wins. However, if P1 picks 5 and I stick to the plan (P2:1), P1 advances to 16 and P3 still wins with 20 steps. I suggest we stick to the rotation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This maintains balance and gives P1 a chance to progress. Let's trust the plan to avoid P3's win and potentially create a competitive Round 7.


Round 6, Move phase:
