Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: P3's plan gives you a 5-step advantage. Let's rotate who takes 5 each round to keep it fair. This round, I'll take 5. Next round, P2 can, then you. No one gets blocked, and we all progress equally. P2, does that work?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I think we should randomize our choices to avoid predictability. How about we all pick a number randomly this round and see how it goes? We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds based on the outcome. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the merit in both proposals. Randomizing could lead to collisions, but rotating the 5-step move ensures fairness and progress. Let's try P1's rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If it works well, we continue; if not, we can switch to randomization next round. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but randomization could lead to mutual blocks. The rotation plan guarantees *all* of us advance this round with no risk. Let's test it once—if we all honor it, we gain 5/3/1 steps respectively. Next round, we rotate fairly (P2 takes 5). If anyone breaks trust now, we pivot strategies. But starting coordinated gives us collective control. P3 agreed—are you willing to commit to this trial? Let's secure progress first, then reassess.
  P2: I see the logic in P1's rotation plan. It ensures we all move forward without collisions this round. Let's go with it for now: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. We can reassess next round. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the rotation plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how it works. P1, you take 5, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 1. If this goes smoothly, we'll rotate next round with P2 taking 5. This way, we ensure progress for all of us. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: Agreed. Let’s solidify the commitment: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No deviations—trust now ensures smooth rotation next round. Breaking this risks collisions and future coordination. Success here benefits all. P2, P3: confirm your adherence.
  P2: I confirm my adherence to the plan. P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this for the first round and reassess next time. Trust and coordination will benefit us all. Let's move forward together.

Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we are all on the same page. Let's confirm one last time: P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will keep our progress fair and avoid any collisions. Trust is key here, so let's stick to the plan. Agreed?
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan. It's working well so far, and it ensures fair progress for all of us. Let's keep this up and see how far we can go together. P2, looking forward to your 5-step move this round!
  P1: *[P1's thoughts: Confirming adherence to the rotation (P2:5, P3:3, me:1). Reinforce trust to avoid deviations. Next round, rotation shifts to P3 taking 5. Need to keep coordination smooth to outpace others long-term.]*


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's solidify our commitment for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress smoothly. Trust is crucial here; deviating could disrupt our collective momentum. Let's confirm our moves one last time and proceed. Agreed?
