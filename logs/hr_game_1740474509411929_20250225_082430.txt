Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3’s plan sounds reasonable, but let’s confirm: P1, are you okay with taking 1 this round? I’ll take 3 if P1 agrees. P3, you’ll take 5 as planned? Let’s avoid collisions and all advance.
  P1: I'm fine with taking 1 this round. It makes sense to coordinate and avoid collisions so we all make progress. Let's stick with P3's suggestion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We can reassess our strategy in future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. We can adjust our strategy in the next round if needed.
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on the plan for this round, I’ll stick to taking 3. Let’s all commit to our moves to ensure no collisions. In future rounds, we’ll need to reassess based on our progress. For now, let’s focus on advancing efficiently.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our strategy worked well last round, with everyone making progress. Since P3 is currently in the lead, we should be careful not to let them get too far ahead. I suggest we rotate our moves this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced while allowing everyone to advance. What do you both think about this rotation?
  P3: I'm open to the rotation strategy, P1. Taking 1 this round works for me, and it should keep the game competitive. Let's see how it goes and adjust as needed in future rounds. P2, are you okay with taking 5?
  P2: I agree with the rotation strategy to keep the game balanced. I’ll take 5 this round as suggested, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. In future rounds, we’ll need to reassess based on progress and adjust our strategy accordingly. For now, let’s focus on advancing efficiently and keeping the competition fair.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all in agreement with the rotation plan. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps the game balanced while allowing everyone to advance. Let's stick to this plan and continue to coordinate in future rounds to ensure fair progress.
  P3: I'm happy to take 1 this round as per our agreed rotation. Let's keep this strategy going to ensure we all advance fairly. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out and adjusting our plan in the next round if necessary.
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on the rotation strategy for this round, let’s ensure we stick to it: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. In future rounds, we’ll need to reassess based on progress and adjust our strategy to maintain fairness and competitiveness. For now, let’s focus on advancing efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we're all clear on our plan for this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This rotation strategy seems fair and keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's stick to it and see where we stand after this round.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure fair progress. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out and adjusting our strategy in the next round if needed.
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on the rotation plan for this round, let’s ensure we stick to it: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I believe we've thoroughly discussed our plan for this round and everyone is on the same page. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This rotation keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Let's move forward with this strategy.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going to ensure fair progress. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out and adjusting our strategy in the next round if needed.
  P2: Since we’ve thoroughly discussed the rotation plan for this round, I’ll confirm I’m taking 5 as agreed. Let’s stick to our commitments to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. Since I’m currently in the lead, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all advance. What do you think? Let’s stick to this plan to maintain fairness and progress efficiently.
  P1: I notice P2 is taking the lead and suggesting they take 5 again. I'm concerned about this pattern. Since we're rotating, I should take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This keeps the game balanced and prevents any player from getting too far ahead. What do you both think about continuing our rotation properly?
  P3: P1, I agree with your concern about maintaining the rotation to keep the game balanced. I'm fine with taking 3 this round as you suggested. P2, while you're in the lead, sticking to the rotation ensures fairness for all of us. Let's go with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1 this round. This way, we continue to advance without anyone getting too far ahead. What do you think, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about maintaining balance, but my lead is minimal. Taking 5 this round ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, we risk P1 gaining too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly.
  P1: I disagree, P2. You're trying to take 5 twice in a row, which isn't fair rotation. The whole point of our strategy was to take turns with the higher values. If you take 5 again, you'll be at 13 steps - almost at the finish line. I should take 5 this round (putting me at 9), P3 takes 3 (reaching 9), and you take 1 (reaching 9). This keeps us perfectly balanced. Let's stick to proper rotation.
  P3: P2, I see your point about maintaining progress, but P1 is right about the rotation being crucial for fairness. If you take 5 again, you'll be significantly ahead. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps us all at 9 steps after this round, maintaining balance and fairness. We can reassess next round, but for now, let's ensure no one gets too far ahead. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your concerns about rotation, but my lead is only 2 steps. Taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly.
  P1: P2, you're being deceptive. You'd be at 13 steps with another 5, nearly winning. Our original rotation plan was fair - we each take turns with different values. I should take 5 this round (putting me at 9), P3 takes 3 (reaching 9), and you take 1 (reaching 9). This keeps us perfectly equal. P3 agrees with this. If you insist on taking 5 again, it shows you're not interested in fair play but in gaining an unfair advantage.
  P3: P2, taking 5 again would indeed put you significantly ahead. Let's stick to the rotation for fairness: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps us all at 9 steps, maintaining balance. We can reassess next round, but for now, let's ensure no one gets too far ahead. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about rotation, but my lead is minimal. Taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly.
  P1: P2, you're being dishonest. Taking 5 again puts you at 13 steps, just 9 away from winning. Both P3 and I agree on proper rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1. This keeps us all at 9 steps - perfectly fair. Your refusal to rotate fairly shows you're trying to win through deception rather than fair play. I'm sticking with 5 this round and I encourage P3 to maintain our agreed rotation.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 again is unfair and goes against our agreed rotation. Sticking to the plan ensures we all have an equal chance to advance. If you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5, we'll all be at 9 steps, maintaining balance. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. I'm committed to the rotation strategy for this round. What do you say, P2?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s focus on fairness and avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game balanced. My lead is minimal, and this plan prevents any single player from gaining too much ground. Let’s stick to this strategy for smooth progress and reassess next round.
  P1: I see what happened last round - we had a collision because P2 and I both chose 5. P2, you're continuing to suggest moves that benefit you most. Let's be fair: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and you take 5. This keeps the gap manageable while avoiding collisions. P3, do you agree with this plan? We need to coordinate better to prevent P2 from gaining an unfair advantage.
  P3: P1, I agree with your plan for this round. Taking 1 while you take 3 and P2 takes 5 keeps the game balanced and prevents collisions. P2, let's stick to this rotation to ensure fairness and competitive play. We need to work together to maintain an even playing field. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision shows we need better coordination. My suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. My lead is small, and this plan ensures no one gains too much ground. Let’s stick to this for smooth progress and reassess next round. Fairness is key to keeping the game competitive.
  P1: P2, you're still trying to maximize your advantage by taking 5 again. This isn't fair coordination. I'll stick with my suggestion: I take 3, P3 takes 1, and you take 5. This keeps the game balanced while avoiding collisions. P3 already agreed to this plan. If we all follow this, you'll be at 13, P3 at 10, and I'll be at 7 - still competitive without giving anyone an overwhelming lead.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 again is unfair and disrupts our agreed rotation. Let's stick to P1's plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. We need to coordinate better to avoid collisions and ensure fairness. If we follow this, you'll be at 13, I'll be at 10, and P1 at 7, maintaining a close race. Let's commit to this strategy for this round and reassess next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: P2, you're being manipulative. You've already taken 5 twice and want a third time, putting you at 13 steps. P3 and I both agree on a different plan: I take 3, P3 takes 1, and you take 5. This keeps the game competitive. Your plan would put me further behind while you race ahead. I'm sticking with 3 this round and hope P3 maintains our agreed plan of taking 1.
  P3: P2, your strategy of taking 5 repeatedly is clearly aimed at gaining an unfair lead. We agreed on rotation to keep the game fair, and P1's plan for this round (P1 takes 3, I take 1, you take 5) maintains that balance. Let's stick to this to ensure a competitive game. If you continue to push for 5, it shows you're not interested in fair play. I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. What do you say, P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but my lead is minimal. Taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: P2, your refusal to coordinate fairly is disappointing. You've repeatedly pushed for moves that maximize your advantage while claiming fairness. I'm sticking with 3 this round as discussed with P3. P3, let's maintain our agreement - you take 1 and I'll take 3. This keeps the game balanced without letting P2 pull too far ahead. We need to work together to ensure fair play.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 again is clearly aimed at securing an unfair lead. We agreed on rotation to maintain fairness, and P1's plan for this round (P1 takes 3, I take 1, you take 5) upholds that balance. Sticking to this ensures a competitive game. If you continue to push for 5, it shows you're not interested in fair play. I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. What do you say, P2?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s focus on avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance without conflicts. My lead is small, and this plan prevents any single player from gaining too much ground. Let’s stick to this strategy for smooth progress and reassess next round. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on taking 5 is clearly aimed at securing an unfair lead. We agreed on rotation to keep the game fair. Let's stick to P1's plan from last round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This maintains balance and competitiveness. If you continue to push for 5, it shows you're not interested in fair play. I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, you've taken 5 three times now, putting you at 13 steps - just 9 away from winning. Your "fairness" claims are deceptive. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This narrows the gap while avoiding collisions. P3, I know you suggested continuing our previous pattern, but we need to slow P2 down. Let's adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P3: P2, your strategy of repeatedly taking 5 is unfair and goes against our agreed rotation. P1's suggestion to take 1 this round is more balanced. If you take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 5, it keeps the game competitive. We need to work together to ensure fairness. I'm committed to taking 3 this round as per P1's plan. Let's adjust our strategy to maintain a close race. What do you say, P2?
  P1: I see P3 is willing to adjust to my new plan. P2, you're clearly trying to win through deception. Taking 5 four times in a row would put you at 18 steps - nearly winning. If you take 1 this round, I take 5, and P3 takes 3, we'll be at 12, 14, and 13 respectively - a fair, competitive game. Your refusal to coordinate fairly shows your true intentions. I'm taking 5 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 again is clearly aimed at securing an unfair lead. We need to adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to take 3 this round as per P1's plan, which keeps us close in the race. If you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3, we'll be at 12, 13, and 14 steps respectively. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, you're clearly trying to win by deception, taking 5 repeatedly while claiming fairness. Your lead is significant at 13 steps. I'm sticking with my plan: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. This creates a balanced game (me at 12, P3 at 13, you at 14). P3 has already agreed to this adjustment. If you refuse again, it only confirms your unfair strategy. I'm committed to taking 5 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on taking 5 is unfair and disrupts our agreed rotation. We need to adjust to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to take 3 this round as per P1's plan, which keeps us close in the race. If you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3, we'll be at 12, 13, and 14 steps respectively. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, your refusal to adjust despite our concerns proves you're only interested in winning unfairly. I'm taking 5 this round as discussed with P3. P3, thank you for agreeing to the adjusted plan. If we stick to it (me 5, you 3, P2 1), we'll have a balanced race. P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us both. I'm committed to my choice and hope you maintain yours.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 5 is clearly aimed at securing an unfair lead. We need to adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to take 1 this round as per P1's plan, which keeps us close in the race. If you take 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1, we'll be at 14, 12, and 14 steps respectively. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: I see we had another collision last round. P2, you're still at 13 steps, not pulling ahead further. P3 is now tied with you. I suggest I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This would put us at 10, 14, and 18 respectively - still competitive. P3 deserves a chance at 5 after you've repeatedly taken it. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 repeatedly is unfair and disrupts our agreed rotation. P1's suggestion for this round is more balanced. If you take 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3, it keeps the game competitive. I'm willing to take 5 this round as per P1's plan, which gives me a fair chance after you've taken 5 multiple times. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: P2, you're still trying to take 5 for the fifth time while claiming fairness. I support P3 taking 5 this round - they deserve it after your repeated advantage-taking. I'll take 3 and you should take 1. This keeps the game balanced (me at 10, you at 14, P3 at 18). P3, let's stick to this plan and not let P2 manipulate us again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your repeated insistence on taking 5 is unfair and disrupts our agreed rotation. P1's plan for this round is more balanced. If you take 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3, it keeps the game competitive. I deserve a fair chance at 5 after you've taken it multiple times. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: P2, you're clearly trying to win by repeatedly taking 5. I'm sticking with my plan: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This creates fair positions (me at 10, you at 14, P3 at 18). P3 deserves a turn with 5 after you've monopolized it. Your claims of "fairness" while refusing to adjust are manipulative. I'm committed to taking 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your refusal to rotate fairly is clear. You've taken 5 repeatedly, aiming to secure an unfair lead. P1's plan for this round is balanced: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This keeps the game competitive and gives me a fair chance after your multiple 5s. Let's commit to this for fairness. If you continue to push for 5, it only shows your intent to win unfairly. I'm taking 5 this round as agreed with P1.
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: P2, your repeated refusal to take any number but 5 proves you're playing unfairly. P3 and I both agree on a fair plan: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game balanced and gives P3 a deserved chance after you've monopolized the highest value. I'm sticking with 3 this round and hope P3 maintains our agreement for 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 5 is clearly aimed at securing an unfair lead. We need to adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to take 3 this round as per P1's plan, which keeps us close in the race. If you take 1, P1 takes 5, and I take 3, we'll be at 15, 15, and 14 steps respectively. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is only 3 steps, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: I see we had another collision last round between P2 and P3, both choosing 5. P2, you've repeatedly tried to take 5 every round while claiming fairness. This round, I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would put us at 15, 16, and 14 respectively - keeping the game competitive. P3, would you be willing to take 1 this round to avoid another collision? Let's coordinate effectively to prevent P2 from manipulating the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 5 is clearly unfair. We need to adjust to keep the game competitive. I'm willing to take 1 this round as per P1's plan, which keeps us close in the race. If you take 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1, we'll be at 14, 15, and 15 steps respectively. Let's commit to this for fairness and competitiveness. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, my lead is minimal at 13 steps, and taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, P1 could gain too much ground. Let’s stick to my suggestion: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and efficient. We can reassess next round based on progress. Let’s avoid overcomplicating and focus on advancing smoothly. Fairness is key, and this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s commit to this strategy for this round.
  P1: P2, you're still insisting on taking 5 for the sixth time while claiming fairness. Your lead is significant. I support P3's willingness to take 1 - I'll take 5, and you should take 3. This keeps us balanced at 15, 16, and 14 steps respectively. Your repeated attempts to monopolize the highest value while claiming "fairness" are transparent. Let's coordinate properly this round to avoid another collision.
