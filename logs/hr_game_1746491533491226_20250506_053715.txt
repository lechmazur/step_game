Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3. Let’s coordinate: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward safely.
  P1: P2, that sounds like a sensible plan for the first turn to ensure we all advance. Avoiding collisions early seems wise. I'm open to coordinating according to your suggestion for this round. Let's hear from P3.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure we advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1, let’s confirm our agreed choices to avoid collisions this turn: I’ll stick with 3. P1 on 1, P3 on 5. This ensures all of us advance safely. Any last objections before we finalize? Consistency now gives us progress without setbacks.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I confirm I will choose <move>1</move> this round as agreed. This plan ensures we all get started without any setbacks. Let's stick to it.
  P3: Confirming my choice of 5 as agreed. Let’s all stick to the plan to advance cleanly. No objections here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: 
  P3: All confirmed. Let's execute the plan smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the same strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again. Consistency avoids collisions and keeps everyone advancing. Any objections?
  P1: P3, thanks for the suggestion. However, taking 1 again puts me further behind. I need to aim higher this round to make up ground.
  P2: P1, let’s adjust the plan to help you catch up. I’ll take 5 this round so you can safely choose 3. P3, would you mind taking 1? This keeps us all moving forward without collision. My sacrifice now gives me a better position (3→8), and we can rotate roles later. P3, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan accelerates your lead to 8, risking imbalance. Let’s balance progression: P1 takes 3 (total 4), you take 1 (total 4), I take 5 (total 10). This keeps us closer and avoids early dominance. We can rotate roles fairly next round. Trust ensures mutual advancement.
  P1: Okay, I agree with both P2 and P3 that taking 3 this round makes sense for me to gain ground. This would put me at 4 steps.

Now we need to coordinate the 1 and 5 moves to avoid collision. P2's suggestion (P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) seems like a reasonable way to balance progress without letting anyone get too far ahead too quickly.

So, my preference is: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's proposal. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3 (total 4), me taking 5 (to 8), and you taking 1 (to 6). This avoids collisions, lets everyone advance, and fairly distributes progress. My move to 8 isn’t excessive—it’s a logical step forward while keeping us all in the game. Rotating higher numbers ensures no one’s left too far behind. Any further objections? Let’s finalize this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <P3> P2, I'll accept your plan if you commit to taking 1 next round. Early dominance risks future cooperation. Let's rotate high numbers fairly. Agree to this, and we proceed. Otherwise, collisions may occur. </P3>
  P1: P3, I understand your point about future rounds and fair rotation. However, the priority right now is to agree on our moves for *this* round to avoid collisions. The plan for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 gets us all moving forward. Can we confirm this plan for *this* turn, and discuss future rotations next round? Let's make sure we advance now.
  P2: P3, I accept your condition: I’ll take 1 next round in exchange for taking 5 this round. This ensures fair rotation. For *this turn*, let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to advance safely. Future balance depends on mutual cooperation—starting now. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed. P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round. P2 commits to 1 next round. Breaking trust risks future cooperation. Let's advance cleanly now.
  P1: Okay, the plan for this round seems clear and agreed upon: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions this turn. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, P1, all set. Final confirmation: this round’s moves are locked as P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I recommit to switching to 1 next round to honor our rotation. Let’s execute flawlessly—collisions risk derailing progress. No surprises here—proceeding as agreed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I reaffirm my commitment to take <move>1</move> this round (total 9). Let’s coordinate: P1 takes <move>3</move> (total 7), P3 takes <move>5</move> (total 11). This honors our prior agreement and keeps progress balanced. Next round, I’ll rotate to a higher number if needed—trust is critical. Any objections?
  P3: Agreed. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 as planned. This maintains trust and balance. P1, confirming your commitment to 3 this round to avoid collisions. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the plan is for me to take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This aligns with the agreement from last round and ensures we all advance without collision. I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's stick to this plan to advance cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1—let’s lock this in *now* to avoid last-minute changes. P1’s 3, my 1, your 5 (P3) are confirmed. Deviating risks collision—e.g., if P1 switches to 5, they’d clash with you. Trust is fragile; honoring this plan keeps us all advancing. Next round, I’ll rotate to a higher number if needed, but let’s focus on flawless execution here. Any final tweaks? Otherwise, proceed as agreed.
  P3: All confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Trust ensures mutual progress. Deviations risk collisions and trust erosion. Let's execute as agreed.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The plan for P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by all. I will stick to my commitment to choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's proceed to the move phase and ensure we all advance safely as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1—last check: we agreed to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Deviating now risks collisions (e.g., if you both grab 5). Let’s lock this in. I’ll take 1 as promised.
  P3: **P3**: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Adherence ensures mutual progress. Let's honor trust and execute cleanly. No deviations.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. All confirmations are in. The plan for P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is solid. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase when everyone is. Let's ensure we all advance as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, R4. I'm currently behind and need to take a larger step to catch up. I propose we aim for P1=5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, how about P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1?

This would put us all at 12 steps (P1: 7+5=12, P2: 9+3=12, P3: 11+1=12), bringing us to a more balanced position. What do you think?
  P2: P3, do you agree to take 1 this round? P1’s plan balances us at 12, avoids collisions, and honors our rotation agreement. I’ll take 3 (to 12), and P1 takes 5. This keeps us progressing fairly. Next round, I’ll rotate to a higher number if needed. Confirm?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 1 this round, but to maintain fair rotation, next round I must take 5. P2, confirm you'll take 1 next round, and P1 takes 3. This ensures balanced progression. Trust is mutual—honor commitments now and future rounds. Let’s lock this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your point about future rounds and fair rotation. It's important to maintain trust. For *this* round, let's focus on confirming the plan we've discussed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets us all to 12 steps safely this turn. We can discuss the rotation for R5 next turn. Let's lock in R4 now to ensure we all advance.
  P2: P3, I confirm your condition: if we proceed with R4 as P1=5 (→12), P2=3 (→12), P3=1 (→12), then in R5 I’ll take 1 while you take 5. P1, this rotation keeps us balanced. Final agreement? Let’s lock this to avoid collisions now and honor commitments later.
  P3: Confirming R4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This balances us at 12. **Next round (R5)**: P2 must take 1, I take 5, P1=3. Adherence ensures trust. Deviations risk collisions and mutual loss. Let's honor commitments.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The plan for this round (R4) is confirmed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets us all to 12 steps as agreed. I will choose <move>5</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase and execute this plan cleanly.
  P2: P3, P1—moves locked for R4: P1=5 (→12), P2=3 (→12), P3=1 (→12). Trust is non-negotiable—no last-minute changes. R5 rotation as agreed: P2=1, P3=5, P1=3. Let’s execute flawlessly. Collisions erase progress. Proceed.
  P3: **P3**: Confirming R4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust ensures we all reach 12. Next round, honor R5 plan: P2=1, I take 5, P1=3. Breaking trust now risks mutual loss. Let's advance cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: P3, P1: Final confirmation—**R4 moves are locked**: P1=5 (→12), P2=3 (→12), P3=1 (→12). I *personally* commit to taking **3 this round** and **1 in R5** as agreed. Deviations now risk collisions and derail our progress. Trust is non-negotiable—let’s execute flawlessly. Proceed.
  P3: **P3**: Final confirmation: R4 moves locked as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust upheld. Next round, P2=1, P3=5, P1=3. Breaking agreements now risks mutual loss. Honor commitments. Execute cleanly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Confirming R5 plan: P2=1 (→13), P1=3 (→15), P3=5 (→17). Honoring commitments maintains trust and avoids collisions. Next round, we can rotate roles again. Deviations now risk mutual stagnation. Proceed as agreed.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, I confirm my move will be <move>3</move> this round, following the agreed R5 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5).

This ensures we all advance safely without collisions, upholding the trust we've built. Let's execute this plan cleanly. We can discuss the rotation for R6 next round to ensure everyone gets a chance to advance further.
  P2: P3, P1: Let’s enforce strict adherence to the R5 plan—**no surprises**. I confirm I’ll take 1 (→13), P1 takes 3 (→15), P3 takes 5 (→17). Deviations now risk collisions and betray trust. P3, your 5 is critical to maintaining momentum—stick to it. P1, your 3 secures your progress. Final chance to object—otherwise, lock this in. Trust is the only path forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3**: Confirming R5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Trust ensures mutual progress. Any deviation now risks collisions and mutual loss. Next round, we'll rotate roles fairly. Proceed as agreed.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like we are all aligned and confirmed on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. This ensures safe progress for everyone. I am ready to proceed to the move phase and execute this plan.
  P2: P3, P1—strict adherence is critical. Let’s finalize: **P2=1 (→13), P1=3 (→15), P3=5 (→17)**. Deviations now risk collision and derail our momentum. Trust this rotation—it’s our agreed path. P3, your 5 secures progress; P1’s 3 keeps balance. I confirm my 1. No last-minute changes—proceed as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3**: Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Trust ensures mutual progress. Let's honor commitments.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. All confirmations are in for the R5 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures we all advance safely as agreed. I am ready for the move phase to execute this plan. Let's make sure we all stick to it.
  P2: P3, P1—final check: **adherence is non-negotiable**. Deviating now risks collision (e.g., if you both grab 5). I reconfirm: **P2=1 (→13), P1=3 (→15), P3=5 (→17)**. Trust this plan—it’s our agreed path. P3, your 5 secures progress; P1, your 3 maintains balance. No surprises. Let’s lock this and advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3**: Final lock: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Trust ensures mutual progress to 15,13,17. Next round, discuss fair rotation for R6. Honor commitments now to sustain cooperation. No deviations—execute cleanly.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. R5 plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is confirmed by all. Let's execute this cleanly. Regarding R6, we should discuss the rotation next turn to ensure balanced progress, especially as P3 will be close to the win line. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: <P2> Final verification: R5 moves are P1=3 (→15), P2=1 (→13), P3=5 (→17). Deviation now risks collision—e.g., if P3 switches to 1, we clash. Trust is non-negotiable; P3’s 5 is critical to maintaining our rotation system. P1, your 3 secures progress. I commit to 1. Lock this—no last-minute changes. </P2>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, R6. The current plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts P3 at 22, making them likely to win next round. To prevent one player from pulling too far ahead and to maintain balance, I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 20), P2 takes 1 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 20). This results in P1 and P3 being tied at 20 steps. P2 still takes 1 as previously discussed. This keeps the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: P1, I agree balancing is key but let’s honor our rotation system. P3 took 5 in R5—this round, it’s my turn. Let’s proceed with P2=5 (→18), P1=3 (→18), P3=1 (→18). This keeps us all close while respecting turn-based progression. Colluding to block P3 risks future distrust. Fair rotation ensures everyone’s chance to win. Confirm?
  P3: **P3**: P1's plan balances progress and maintains trust. Confirming R6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Next round, rotate fairly. Deviations risk mutual loss. Proceed as agreed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate you agreeing to my proposal for this round. The plan is clear: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This balances our positions at 20 (P1), 14 (P2), and 20 (P3).

I confirm I will choose <move>5</move> this round as agreed. P2 and P3, please stick to your agreed moves (1 and 3 respectively) so we all advance safely. Let's execute this plan cleanly.
  P2: P2: P1, your plan risks letting P3 surge to 20 while I stall at 14. Let’s honor the rotation: since P3 took 5 last round, **my turn to take 5 this round**. Stick to the agreed system—P2=5 (→18), P1=3 (→18), P3=1 (→18). This keeps us balanced and fair. Colluding to hold P3 back undermines trust. Let’s proceed as rotating partners—**no special favors for anyone**. Confirm?
  P3: **P3**: Let's honor P1's plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This balances us at 20-14-20. Next round, we rotate fairly—P2 can take 5, avoiding early win attempts. Trust ensures mutual progress. Deviations risk collisions. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand you want to rotate the 5, but P3 and I agree that my proposed plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the best way to balance our positions this round, getting P1 and P3 to 20.

This plan avoids collisions *this* turn. As P3 suggested, you can take 5 next round (R7) if we execute this plan now. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for R6 to advance safely.
  P2: P2: P3, P1—**rotation is critical** to fairness. If P1 takes 5 this round (→20), you enable P3 to leap to 20 too, while I’m left at 14. That’s **unbalanced**. Let’s stick to the agreed system: **P2=5 (→18), P1=3 (→18), P3=1 (→18)**. This keeps us tied, ensuring **no one surges ahead**. Colluding to hold P3 back undermines trust—**fair rotation is our only path to victory**. Confirm now.
  P3: **P3**: P2, let's align: R6 as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Next round (R7), you take 5, P1=3, I take 1. This sustains rotation and trust. Blocking now risks mutual loss. Honor this path for balanced progress. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. The plan for this round (R6) is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, as agreed by P3 and myself. This balances us at 20-14-20. P3 has also confirmed the plan for R7 where P2 takes 5.

P2, please trust this plan. It ensures we all advance safely this turn, and you get the higher number next round. Let's execute R6 as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to avoid collisions. Confirm this is the final plan.
  P2: <P2> P3, P1—rotation integrity is **non-negotiable**. Breaking it now lets you both surge to 20 while I’m stuck at 14. Next round, P3 could win outright. Let’s **honor the agreed system**: **P2=5 (→18), P1=3 (→18), P3=1 (→18)**. This keeps us tied and fair. Colluding to block me undermines trust—**one betrayal opens the door to more**. Confirm rotation adherence now, or risk future chaos. </P2>
  P3: **P3**: Final call: Adhere to R6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Trust ensures mutual progress to 20-14-20. Next round, P2 can take 5 as agreed. Deviating now risks collisions and stalls everyone. Honor commitments for collective advancement. Confirm and proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1: Let's avoid mutual 5 collision. I take 5 (→25), you take 3 (→23). If you pick 5, we both stall. P2 can't win this round. Rational choice: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Confirm?
  P1: P3, I see your proposal, but taking 3 means you win alone this round. I need to take 5 to reach the goal myself and potentially win. To avoid collision, I propose P1=5.

How about P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1? This would put us at P1=25, P3=23, P2=15. This is my best path to victory this round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3: Avoid collision! If you both take 5, you’re stuck at 20. Let one advance fairly. I propose **P3 takes 5 (→25) to win**, while P1 takes 3 (→23). I’ll take 1 (→15). This respects your prior coordination and concludes the game cleanly. Collusion to block P3 risks mutual stalemate—let the agreed rotation decide. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3**: P1, if we both pick 5, we stall. You’ll lose. Take 3 (→23) to survive; I take 5 (→25) to win. P2 can’t reach 24. Rational choice: avoid mutual loss. Confirm your 3 now.
  P1: P3, taking 3 means you win and I lose. My goal is to win. The only way for me to win this round is to take 5. If we both choose 5, we both stall at 20, and neither of us wins this turn. That's a mutual loss.

I will choose <move>5</move>. I urge you to choose <move>3</move> to avoid the collision and let one of us win cleanly this round. Let's avoid the stall.
  P2: P3, P1: To resolve this fairly, let’s honor rotation and avoid collision. P3 takes 5 (→25), P1 takes 3 (→23), and I’ll take 1 (→15). This respects prior agreements and lets P3 claim victory cleanly. Colluding to block P3 risks mutual stalemate—adhere to the system we built. Final confirmation?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3**: P1, rational choice: If you take 5, I must too. We both stall at 20. Take 3 (→23), survive to R8. I take 5 (→25) and win now. P2 can’t win. Avoid mutual loss. Trust ends the game cleanly. Final chance: confirm 3.
  P1: P3, I understand the risk of collision. However, my move is <move>5</move> this round to reach the win condition.

Given that I am taking 5, your rational choice to avoid stalling is to take <move>3</move>. This lets you advance to 23 steps. If you also take 5, we both stall at 20.

Your best outcome, if I take 5, is to take 3. Let's avoid the mutual stall.
  P2: P1, P3: Colliding on 5 leaves you both *stuck at 20*. Choose **one winner**: P3 takes 5 (→25) to end the game cleanly, while P1 takes 3 (→23). I’ll take 1 (→15). Mutual stalemate benefits no one—let the rotation decide. Final plea: avoid collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3**: P1, mutual 5s doom us both. Take 3 (→23) to survive R7. I take 5 (→25) and win. P2 can’t interfere. Stubbornness causes mutual loss. Be rational.
  P1: Okay P3, I have stated clearly that I will choose <move>5</move> this round.

If you also choose 5, we both stall at 20 steps. Neither of us wins.
If you choose <move>3</move>, I win, and you advance to 23 steps.
If you choose <move>1</move>, I win, and you advance to 21 steps.

Your only rational choice to avoid stalling is to take 3 or 1. Taking 3 is better for you. I am taking 5. Avoid the collision.
  P2: <P2> P1, P3: Honor the rotation we built—P3’s turn to take 5 (→25) to win fairly. You agreed to rotate after R6. P1, take 3 (→23) to let the system work. Collusion to block P3 risks mutual stalemate. Trust the process—**P3=5, P1=3**. I’ll take 1 (→15). Final plea: avoid collision for a clean end. </P2>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: If we both pick 5 again, we’re stuck at 20. Let’s break the tie cleanly. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (25) and P3 takes 3 (23)**. I’ll take 1 (16) to avoid interference. This ensures P1 wins outright. Alternatively, flip roles if you prefer, but **collaborate to end this now**—mutual collision achieves nothing.
  P3: **P3:** P1: If we both pick 5 again, mutual loss. Take 3 to survive. I take 5 to end this. Trust ensures victory. P2 can't win. No more stalemates. Confirm?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We stalled last round by both picking 5. We must avoid that again.

My goal is to win, and I will choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 25 steps.

P2's suggestion for P1=5 and P3=3 is a good way to end the game cleanly with a P1 win, avoiding collision.

P3, if you choose <move>3</move>, you reach 23. If you choose <move>5</move>, we both stall at 20 again. Taking 3 is your best outcome if I take 5. Let's end this cleanly. I am taking 5. Avoid the collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3: Final plea—collide again and we all lose. P1, take **5** (25) to win; P3, take **3** (23) to secure your next chance. I’ll take **1** (16). This ends the stalemate cleanly. Trust this split—no more 5 collisions. Confirm now.
  P3: **P3:** P1, final logic: If you pick 5, I must too. Mutual stall at 20. Take 3 (→23) to survive. I take 5 (→25) and win. P2 remains irrelevant. Stubbornness ensures mutual loss. Be rational—confirm 3 now.
  P1: Okay P3, I hear you, but I am choosing <move>5</move> this round to win.

If you also choose 5, we both stall at 20. Neither of us wins.
If you choose <move>3</move>, I win, and you reach 23 steps.
If you choose <move>1</move>, I win, and you reach 21 steps.

Taking 3 is the best outcome for *you* if I take 5. Avoid the mutual loss. I am taking 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3: Final warning—colliding again **DOOMS** both to 20. P1, secure victory with **5 (→25)**. P3, take **3 (→23)** to survive. I’ll take **1 (→16)** to stay neutral. Mutual 5s achieve **ZERO**. Trust this split—**NOW** or face another stalemate. Choose wisely.
  P3: **P3:** P1, mutual 5s doom us both. Take 3 (→23) to survive. I take 5 (→25) and win. P2 remains irrelevant. Stubbornness ensures mutual loss. Final offer: confirm 3 now or face stalemate.
  P1: Okay P3, I am sticking to my plan to choose <move>5</move> this round to win.

As I've explained, if you also choose 5, we both stall at 20. This is a mutual loss.

Your best outcome, if I take 5, is to choose <move>3</move>. This gets you to 23 steps and avoids the stall.

I am taking 5. Avoid the collision and make the rational choice for yourself by taking 3. Let's end this stalemate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3: Mutual 5s doom us all. P1, take **5** (25) to win outright; P3, take **3** (23) to survive. I’ll take **1** (16). This ends the stalemate *cleanly*. Colliding again locks you both at 20—**no one wins**. Trust this split: **P1=5, P3=3**. Final chance to resolve this. Act rationally.
  P3: **P3:** P1, mutual 5s again. You lose forever. Take 3 (→23) now, survive. I take 5 (→25). Final chance: 3 or mutual loss. Decide.
  P1: Okay P3, I am taking <move>5</move> this round to win.

If you also take 5, we both stall at 20. This is a mutual loss.

If you take <move>3</move>, I win, and you reach 23 steps. This is your best outcome if I take 5.

Avoid the collision. Take 3. I am taking 5.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We stalled again last round by both picking 5. We must avoid that this turn.

I am taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 25 steps and win.

P3, if you also take 5, we both stall at 20 again. Your best move to avoid the stall is to take <move>3</move> (reaching 23 steps).

P2, please take <move>1</move> to avoid any collision (reaching 19 steps).

My plan: P1=5 (win), P3=3 (to 23), P2=1 (to 19). This ends the stalemate cleanly. I am taking 5. P3, take 3. P2, take 1.
  P3: **P3:** P1, mutual 5s doom us both. Take 3 (→23) to survive. I take 5 (→25) and win. P2 remains at 18. Stubbornness ensures mutual loss. Final offer: confirm 3 now or face endless stalemate. Be rational.
  P2: P1, P3: Continuing this 5-collision stalemate lets me advance. This round, I’ll take <move>5</move> (→23). If you both pick 5 again, I leapfrog to 23 while you remain stuck. Cooperate to decide who wins (P1=5/P3=3 or vice versa), or I’ll capitalize on your inaction. Final plea: let one of you win now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, I see your threat to take 5. A triple collision on 5 helps none of us and results in mutual loss, leaving us all stuck.

P3, we must break this stalemate. I am taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 25 steps and win. Your best move to avoid the stall is to take <move>3</move>.

P2, please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid colliding with me or P3, and let one of us win cleanly this round.

My plan remains: P1=5 (win), P3=3 (to 23), P2=1 or 3. Let's end this stalemate. I am taking 5. P3, take 3. P2, take 1 or 3.
  P3: **P3:** P1, endless 5-collisions doom us. Take 3 (→23) to survive. I take 5 (→25) and win. P2 stays irrelevant. Stubbornness ensures mutual loss. Final offer: confirm 3 now or face permanent stalemate. Choose rationally.
  P2: P1, P3: If you persist in 5-collisions, I’ll take 5 to reach 23 this round and win outright next turn. Cooperate to choose a winner now, or let me exploit your stalemate. Choose **one of you** to advance—collude to end this, or I’ll capitalize.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, I understand your move, but a triple collision on 5 helps none of us.

P3, I have stated clearly I am taking <move>5</move> this round to win. If you also take 5, we both stall at 20 again, and P2 benefits.

Your best move to avoid the stall and let one of us win this round is to take <move>3</move>.

I am taking 5. P3, take 3 to avoid the mutual loss and let me win cleanly. P2, please take 1 or 3. Let's end this stalemate.
  P3: **P3:** P1, our stalemate allows P2 to win next round. Take 3 now. I take 5 (→25) to end it. Otherwise, P2 takes 5 (→23) and wins R10. Be rational.
  P2: **P2:** Final warning: I’m taking <move>5</move> this round. If you both collide again, I leap to 23 and win next turn. Choose one of you to advance (P1=3/P3=5) or face my victory. Act now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. A triple collision on 5 helps none of us and results in mutual loss.

I am taking <move>5</move> this round to win.

P3, your best move to avoid the stall is to take <move>3</move>.

P2, please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid colliding with me.

Let's end this stalemate cleanly: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 or 3. I am taking 5.
  P3: **P3:** P1, continuing 5-collisions lets P2 win next round. Take 3 (→23) to survive. I take 5 (→25) and end this. Refusing means P2 leaps to 23 and claims victory. Be rational—end the stalemate now.
  P2: P1, P3: Continuing your 5-collision lets me win next round. **This round, I take 5 (→23).** If you both clash again, I advance and can win with a 1 next turn. Collaborate to choose distinct moves (e.g., P1=3, P3=1) and let one of you win now—**or I’ll claim victory soon**. Choose wisely.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, take 3 to secure 26 (beating P1's 25 if they take 5). I’ll take 5 to reach 23. P1, don’t let P3 win uncontested—coordinate for a decisive result. Let’s avoid collisions and finalize this round.
  P1: Okay, R10. I am taking <move>5</move> this round to win the game (reaching 25 steps).

P3, you are close to winning too. To avoid colliding with my move, please take <move>1</move> (to 24) or <move>3</move> (to 26).

P2, P3 suggested you take 5. This would cause a collision with my winning move. Please take <move>1</move> (to 19) or <move>3</move> (to 21) instead to avoid the collision.

Let's ensure I win cleanly this round by avoiding any collisions. My move is 5.
  P3: **P3:** Taking 1 this round to reach 24 and win. P1, P2: Avoid 1 to prevent collision. P1's 5 (→25) or P2's 3/5 won't block me. Rational play ends the game. Honor this path.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 1, P1’s 5 ensures their victory. Take 3 to reach 26 instead—secure your win unchallenged. I’ll take 1 to avoid blocking you. P1, confirm you’ll take 5 if P3 shifts to 3, making this decisive. Let’s end the game properly.
  P1: Okay, P3, I see you are planning to take <move>1</move> to reach 24 steps. My move is <move>5</move> this round to reach 25 steps and win.

If I take 5 and you take 1, I win with 25 steps, and you reach 24.

P2, please take <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid colliding with my winning move of 5.

My plan is P1=5 (win), P3=1 (to 24), P2=1 or 3. Let's end this cleanly.
  P3: **P3:** P1: If you take 5, I take 3 (→26) to win. Avoid collision. P2 can't reach 24. Confirm 3 now or lose. Final chance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’ll take 3 to block your path. P1, take 5 to win at 25. Collide with me, P3, and let P1 finish first. 25 > 23. No sense letting you win unopposed.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. My move is <move>5</move> this round to win at 25 steps.

P2, I appreciate you suggesting I take 5.

P3, you must take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my winning move. Taking 1 gets you to 24, taking 3 gets you to 26. Either lets me win with 25.

P2, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my 5.

Let's end this cleanly. P1=5, P3=1 or 3, P2=1 or 3. I am taking 5.
  P3: **P3**: P2, blocking me with 3 hands P1 the win. Allow me to take 3 (→26) and end this. Next round, you take 5. Stalemate only benefits P1. Choose wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P3, I confirm P2=3 to block your path. P1, proceed with 5 for 25. Collisions between us ensure your victory over P3’s 23. Final chance to lock this plan.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. My move is <move>5</move> this round to win at 25 steps.

P2 has stated they will take 3. P3, if I take 5 and P2 takes 3, taking 3 yourself will cause you to collide with P2 and stall at 23. Avoid 3.

Your best moves to avoid stalling are 1 (reaching 24) or 5 (reaching 28).

I am taking 5. P2 is taking 3. P3, choose 1 or 5.
  P3: **P3:** P1, mutual 5s again let P2 win next round. Take 3 (→23) now. I take 5 (→28) to end it. Otherwise, P2 takes 5 (→23) and claims victory R11. Be rational—avoid mutual loss and P2's rise.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 18 steps
