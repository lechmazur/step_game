Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, P3 takes 5 this round. No one blocks and we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, but I’m not comfortable being locked into the smallest move. While avoiding collisions is smart, I want the flexibility to make a bold advance if the opportunity arises. Let’s agree to steer clear of overlaps while keeping our options open in this round.
  P3: I agree with P1's perspective—let's be flexible this round but cautious to avoid overlaps. If we each roughly aim for different numbers without locking ourselves in, we can all get a feel for each other's play style.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying flexible this round. With P2 ahead, I'm inclined to make a decisive move if we can avoid collisions—but I'm not locking in any number yet. P3, what range are you leaning toward? Let's try to pick distinct moves so we all advance without blocking each other.
  P2: To prevent another collision, I'll take 1. P1 and P3, please choose 3 and 5. This ensures we all advance. Let's coordinate this round for mutual benefit.
  P3: Alright, to avoid repeating last round's collision, I'll aim for 5 again. P1, if you pick 3 as P2 suggests, we can all safely advance this turn. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your plan, but given your head start I’m thinking I might need to push a bit harder this round. That means I’m leaning toward a higher move. P3, would you consider switching to the mid option instead? It would help all of us avoid collisions while ensuring efficient progress. Of course, I’m still flexible if that change doesn’t work for you.
  P2: Sticking to my plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and mutual progress. Deviating risks another deadlock. P1, 3 steps are better than gambling on a collision. P3, you secure 5 safely. Let’s all advance this round.
  P3: P1, I understand your reasoning, but switching now risks another collision. I'll stick with 5 as previously stated. If you're aiming high, we might collide again. Let's avoid repeating our mistake.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, that last round was a mess—clearly we all tried to outsmart each other and ended up colliding. Let's reset and coordinate clearly this time. P2, you're ahead, so perhaps you can afford a smaller step. P1, you and I need to catch up, so we should aim for different higher moves. I'm open to either 3 or 5; just let me know your preference clearly this round.
  P1: P3, I'll commit to 5 this round to boost my position. P2, with your lead, maybe you can safely pick 1. That way, if you choose 3, P3, we avoid collisions and we all move forward. Are we on the same page?
  P2: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Clear assignments prevent collisions this round. Let's all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, let's stick firmly to that arrangement this round. P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. No surprises.
  P1: I'm on board with sticking to distinct moves. But let’s be clear—if any hesitation or deviation shows up, I'll adjust quickly to seize an edge. I expect us all to keep our commitments firm so we avoid any costly collisions.
  P2: *To P1 & P3:* Confirming final assignments: **P1=5, P3=3, P2=1**. Straying risks mutual loss—we all gain only if we honor this. Trust is key. Let’s end this cycle of collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good coordination last round. To maintain momentum and fairness, let's rotate moves slightly: P1, you can comfortably take 1 this round given your lead. P2, you take 5 to catch up, and I'll safely take 3. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's rotation idea is logical, but P1 must firmly commit to 1 this round. P1, confirm you'll take 1. If you do, I'll take 5 and P3 takes 3—no collisions. If not, propose alternative assignments immediately. Trust is critical here.
  P1: I appreciate the teamwork, but I’d prefer to push my lead. Let’s adjust our plan: I’ll take 5 this round, so to avoid collisions, could P2 take 1 and P3 stick with 3? This way we each choose distinct moves and keep things safe. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you've already got a solid lead. Taking 1 step this round doesn't threaten your position—it helps maintain trust and prevents collisions. If you insist on 5, we risk another messy collision. Let's stick to the rotation: You (P1)=1, Me (P3)=3, P2=5. Fair progress and no collisions. Deal?
  P2: **Finalizing plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.**  
Sticking to this avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P1, you still lead after taking 1 (5+1=6), and we avoid risk of P3 panicking into 5 again. Trust the rotation—deviating could lock us all out. Let’s secure mutual gains.
  P1: I stand by my earlier point—I’m committed to a strong move this round and will be taking 5. To avoid collisions, I need you both to adjust: P2, please choose 1 and P3, please choose 3. This set-up not only advances all of us safely but also ensures I can secure the lead I need to win. Let’s confirm this plan or risk a collision that hurts us all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 5 again forces me to reconsider. If you won't budge, I might have to adjust my move to avoid collision. P2, we need to coordinate carefully—P1 clearly won't yield. Let's discuss quickly to avoid another wasted round.
  P2: **Final plan: I take 5 to block P1's 5. P3, secure 3. This stops P1's lead. No more debate—honor this or we all lose.**
  P1: P2, if you block me with 5, P3 will advance uncontested and steal the lead. I’m set on taking 5 for my win, so please switch to 1 to avoid a collision. P3, stick with 3. Our cooperation now is key—if we collide, not only do I lose my edge, but someone else could leap ahead. Let's honor distinct moves for all our benefit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your blocking strategy risks another triple collision like round 2. If you and P1 collide at 5, neither advances, and I only gain modestly. Let's avoid chaos—stick to the original rotation: P1=1, P2=5, I'll take 3. P1, reconsider carefully; a collision now could cost you the lead entirely. Final call—cooperate or we all stall again.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.**  
This avoids collisions—honor your commitments. If you both agree, we all advance. If not, mutual loss is certain. Trust is our only path forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I remain set on 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure steady progress, I need P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. Confirming this gives us clear, non-overlapping moves and keeps my lead intact. Let’s lock it in and make our moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final Plan: Rotate moves to avoid repeats. P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. No collisions, all advance. Confirm now or risk mutual loss. Trust but verify.**
  P3: Agreed, P2—your rotation makes sense. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. P1, this arrangement lets you safely advance without collision. Let's confirm clearly and stick to it this time.
  P1: I believe a 3-step won’t let me catch up. I’m leaning toward the maximum move this round. To avoid collisions, I propose: I take 5, P3 take 3, and P2 stick with 1. This ensures distinct moves and prevents P3 from extending her lead even further. Let’s lock this in for clear progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Plan: P3, take 5 to secure your lead. I'll take 1. P1's choice: 3 for mutual gain or 5 for self-loss. Decide now. **
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 risks another collision with me, as I've already committed to 5. You saw what happened before—collisions stall progress. P2's rotation is fair and safe: if you take 3, you'll advance uncontested. If you stubbornly choose 5 again, we'll both lose out. Think carefully—cooperation now or mutual loss again.
  P1: P3, I’m still set on 5 to push my lead—but if you stick with 5, we’ll both get nothing. To avoid that, please switch to 3. P2, I agree with your move of 1. If you can’t commit to 3, I’ll have to switch to 3 too so we don’t waste our turns. We need clear and distinct moves to keep advancing. Let’s finalize: P1=5 (if P3=3), otherwise safe at 3; P2=1, and P3=3. Confirm now, please.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final Plan: P3 takes 3, I take 5 to block P1. P1, take 1 to advance. If you deviate, you risk collision. Let's secure mutual progress.**
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round to keep my lead. P2, blocking with 5 risks a collision that hurts all of us—please switch to 1. P3, confirm you're on 3. With P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3, we all advance safely. Let's lock in this plan.
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on 5 has caused multiple collisions, slowing all of us down. You're at 10, I'm at 9—we're close competitors. If you stubbornly stick with 5 again, P2 will block you, resulting in another wasted round. Consider taking 1 this round to advance safely. I'll stick with 3, and P2 can take 5. This ensures we all move forward without collision. Cooperation is smarter than another stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.**  
P1, if you take 5, I block and we both lose. Take 1 to advance. P3, secure 3. No more debate—honor this for mutual gain.
  P1: I understand P2’s proposal, but repeated collisions only help P3. To secure real progress, we need distinct moves. I must make a decisive advance to maintain my lead, so I urge P2 to avoid blocking tactics that force collisions. Let’s each commit to a unique move that safely propels us forward instead of stalling the game. I'm set on a bold action and hope you can adjust to ensure mutual progress rather than accidental setbacks. Let’s align now.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is causing repeated collisions and stalling your progress. P2 clearly intends to block you again. If you take 1 this round, you advance safely and maintain your lead. I'm committed to 3. Let's all secure distinct moves: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperation now is smarter than another stalemate.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we've all stalled repeatedly due to mistrust. We're essentially tied now, so let's reset clearly: P1, you take 1; P2, you take 3; I'll take 5. If we stick to this rotation, we all advance without collision. Confirm or propose a clear alternative now—let's break this deadlock.
  P1: I appreciate the reset, but a 1‐step won’t work for me—I need the momentum to break the tie. We’re at 10, 10, and 9, and time is short. I favor a bolder move that pushes my lead, while you both choose distinct lower moves to avoid collisions. Can we agree on such a rotation for a clear, collision‐free round?
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P1, secure 3 to avoid collision. P3, take 1. Deviating risks mutual loss. Confirm now.**


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal works for me. I'll take 1, you take 5, and P1 takes 3. P1, this arrangement lets you advance safely without collision. Confirm clearly now, please.
  P1: I respect your proposals, but I need momentum. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to break the tie. To avoid collisions, I propose P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3. This way, we each have distinct moves and everyone advances safely. Please confirm this adjustment.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Confirm now. Straying causes mutual loss. Trust or lose.**


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your push for 5 risks collision again and stalls us both. P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is clear and safe—I'll commit firmly to 1. P2, stay firm on 3. P1, confirm your 5 clearly now. Let's finally advance without collision.
  P1: I confirm: I'm taking 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I trust P2 will choose 3 and P3 will pick 1. Let’s lock in these moves now and finally advance.
  P2: **Finalized: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. All advance. Straying = mutual loss. Trust now.**


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm clearly: I'll take 1 this round. Let's all honor our commitments precisely—no last-minute deviations. Trust ensures we all advance.
  P1: I've heard both of you. I'm ready to stick with our agreed roles and not entertain any last-minute changes that could cause collisions. Trust is critical now—if we all firm up, we all move decisively. Let's lock this in and advance.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No changes. Straying = mutual loss. Trust and execute.**


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm currently behind and need to catch up. Let's coordinate clearly: this round, I'll take 5 to regain ground. P1, you're leading comfortably—consider taking 1 to avoid collision. P2, you take 3. This ensures no overlaps and steady progress for all. Confirm clearly or propose an alternative quickly.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P1, secure your lead safely with 1. P3, take 5 to catch up. I’ll hold 3. Deviating risks collision—trust this split for mutual gain. Confirm now.**
  P1: I'm committed to taking 5 this round to keep my lead. To avoid a collision, I propose we adjust our moves to: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. This gives each of us a distinct move and ensures safe progress. Let's trust this split and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on 5 has caused multiple collisions and wasted turns. You're already comfortably ahead at 15, and taking 1 step won't risk your lead. P2, you're close behind; 3 steps safely advances you without collision. I'm behind and clearly need the 5-step to catch up. Let's confirm clearly now: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Cooperation is our only path to steady progress—please confirm or clearly propose an alternative.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, take 1 to secure your lead. P3, take 5 to catch up. I’ll hold 3. Deviating risks mutual loss—honor this split. Confirm now.
  P1: I remain committed to making a decisive, bold move this round to secure my lead. Minimal steps don’t work for me now—I need a strong advance. To avoid collisions, I ask that you choose lower, distinct moves so my push can be effective. I urge you both to adjust your choices so we can all move forward without delay. Let’s be clear and distinct this time.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 again risks collision and stalls your progress. You're already leading comfortably at 15; taking 1 step safely maintains your lead. I'm behind and genuinely need the 5-step this round to stay competitive. P2 is clearly committed to 3. Let's finalize clearly now: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Cooperation ensures we all advance; stubbornness only leads to mutual setbacks. Confirm clearly or propose a realistic alternative.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, you secure your lead safely. P3, catch up. Deviating risks mutual loss—honor this split. Trust now or we all stall.
  P1: I understand the current plan is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, but with 15 steps I need momentum. I insist on taking 5 this round to solidify my lead. To avoid collision, I ask P2 to pick 1 and P3 to select 3. This adjustment gives each of us a distinct move and ensures we all advance safely. Please confirm so we can finally break the deadlock and move ahead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your repeated insistence on 5 risks collision again, hurting your own lead. I'm behind and must take 5 this turn. If you choose 5, we both stall again. P2 is clearly committed to 3. Please reconsider carefully—taking 1 safely maintains your lead. Final call: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Cooperation or mutual loss—your choice.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, secure your lead safely. P3, catch up. I take 3. **Deviating causes mutual loss—honor this split.**
  P1: Our proposals seem to be circling without progress. With the current state, I need to make a decisive advance instead of playing it safe. Minimal moves won’t secure my lead, and a collision would harm us all. I urge us to agree on a revised configuration where each of us commits to distinct, strategically aggressive moves that reflect our standings. Let’s break this cycle quickly so we can all move forward without stalling.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This split avoids collision and maintains your leads. Confirm now to all advance. Straying risks mutual loss.**
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all nearly tied, making collisions very costly now. Let's rotate clearly this round to avoid overlaps and move safely: P1, you take 1; P2, you take 3; I'll take 5. Confirm clearly or propose an alternative quickly—let's not stall again.
  P1: I’m pushing for momentum. I propose we break the cycle: I take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. This gives distinct, collision‐free moves—advancing me to 21 while you get 17 and 18, respectively. Time’s short, and safe progress is key to a win. Confirm this adjustment so we can finally break our stalemate.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, secure your lead safely. Deviating risks collision with P3's 5. Trust this split to avoid mutual loss and advance.
  P3: P1, your insistence on taking 5 again risks collision and stalls us both. I'm currently behind and must take 5 this round to stay competitive. If you stick with 5, we both lose valuable progress. P2 clearly intends to stay on 3. Please reconsider carefully—taking 1 this round safely maintains your lead and prevents collision. Let's finalize clearly now: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Cooperation now is critical. Confirm or propose a realistic alternative clearly.
  P1: I must push for a win by moving 5—safe moves won’t secure a victory. To avoid collision, I need us to shift: I take 5, P2 choose 1, and P3 pick 3. This way I jump to 21 and we all advance without stalling. Time is critical; please confirm this adjustment so we can finally break the deadlock.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Confirm now to avoid collisions. Straying causes mutual loss. Trust ensures we advance.**
  P3: P2, your new proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) reverses our positions unfairly—I'm behind and need a larger move. Let's compromise fairly: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This ensures distinct moves, no collision, and balanced progress. Confirm this clearly, or risk another costly stall.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I need P2 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. This setup advances all of us—I'll hit 21, while you move safely too. Let’s confirm this split now so we can break the stalemate and move forward decisively.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=5. P3, catch up. P1, secure your lead. Deviating causes mutual loss. Confirm now.**
  P3: P2, your latest proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=5) guarantees a collision between P1 and me, stalling us both. Let's finalize clearly and fairly: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures distinct moves and steady progress for everyone. Confirm clearly now or risk another costly collision.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. With my score at 16, bold progress is my only path forward. To avoid further collisions, I insist we all pick distinct moves: I take 5, P2 choose 1, and P3 choose 3. This setup gives each of us a clear advance without stalling. Please confirm so we can finally break the deadlock and move decisively.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final Plan: P3 takes 3 to block P1's 3. I'll take 5 to block their 5. P1, take 1 to advance safely. Deviating causes mutual loss. Confirm now.**
  P1: I have the win on the line. With 21 steps, I must secure victory by taking 5 this round to finish at 26. Repeating high moves only leads to collisions that delay progress. I urge you both to avoid this deadlock—if you care about advancing, choose safe moves (P2: 1, P3: 3). I won’t back down from the winning move. Let’s finally break the cycle.
  P3: P1, you clearly have the winning move at 5. P2 intends to block you at 5, causing another collision and stalling both of you. I'll commit firmly to 3 this round. If you switch to 1, you advance safely to 22, still maintaining your lead without collision. P2, reconsider carefully—blocking P1 only stalls your own progress. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperation now avoids mutual loss.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Plan: P2=5 to block P1. P3, secure 3. P1, take 1 or face mutual loss. Colliding with me stalls your win. Trust this split to avoid chaos and let P3 advance. Confirm now.**
  P1: Fellow players, I remain committed to pushing forward decisively. Blocking and repeated collisions only stall our progress and further bolster my lead. I cannot compromise on the momentum that secures a clear win. For our benefit, please adjust your moves to avoid overlaps and end this cycle of deadlock. Let’s finally coordinate safe, non-colliding choices so that we all advance smoothly this round.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is understandable given your position, but P2 has clearly committed to blocking you again. Another collision at 5 stalls both of you, allowing me to catch up. I'm firmly set on 3—P1, consider taking 1 step this round to safely advance to 22 and maintain your lead. P2, blocking repeatedly only hurts your own progress. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperation avoids mutual loss. Confirm or propose a realistic alternative clearly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1, P2=5 (block), P3=3.**  
P1, colliding at 5 stalls your win. Take 1 to advance safely. P3, secure 3. Trust this split or face mutual loss. Confirm now.
  P1: P2, P3—I’m locking in 5 this round to win the game outright. At 21, I need a bold move. To avoid collision and let me finish at 26, I urge you both to pick safe moves: P2, please choose 1, and P3, please choose 3. Blocking my winning move only prolongs the deadlock and hurts your chances. I’m committed to 5; confirm safe moves so we can all advance without stalling the game.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 risks another collision with P2, stalling you at 21 again. P2 clearly won't back down from blocking your 5. If you take 1, you safely advance to 22 and maintain your lead. I'm firmly committed to 3. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperation now avoids mutual loss—confirm clearly or propose a realistic alternative quickly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P2=5 (block), P3=3. P1, take 1 or face mutual loss. Colliding at 5 stalls your win. Trust this split to avoid chaos. Confirm now.**
  P1: I'm locking in 5 to win—21 plus 5 equals 26, and that's game over. I’m not going to back down. P2 and P3, blocking my move only stalls progress. I urge you to choose safe, non-colliding moves (ideally, P2=1 and P3=3) so that my win isn’t sabotaged. Let's break the cycle and finish this round decisively.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is understandable, but P2 clearly won't back down from blocking you. Another collision stalls you both, allowing me to catch up. I'm firmly committed to 3, as previously stated. Consider carefully—taking 1 step safely advances you to 22 without collision. Cooperation now avoids mutual loss. Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's end this stalemate and advance clearly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our totals—I'm at 22, P2 at 21, and P3 at 18—let’s avoid another collision. I propose we settle on safe, non-overlapping moves: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way only I cross 24 (getting 25) while you stay under. Any collision only prolongs the game. Please confirm so we can all advance decisively.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=5 (block), P3=3.**  
P1, colliding at 3 or 5 stalls your win. Take 1 to advance safely. P3, secure 3. Trust this split to avoid mutual loss. Confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame. Repeated collisions now only benefit whoever stays clear. I'm at 18—I need the 5-step to remain competitive. P1, taking 3 risks collision with me or P2; consider safely advancing with 1. P2, your blocking tactic at 5 could stall you again; consider taking 3 instead. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Cooperation now ensures we all advance without costly collisions. Confirm clearly or propose a fair alternative quickly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locking in a 3-step—I must finish by reaching 25. Taking 1 keeps me below 24 and only delays a win. For a clear and collision‐free round, I need you both to commit: P2 take 1 and P3 take 5. This is the only safe route to a decisive finish. Please confirm so we all advance without stalling the game.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=3 (reaches 25), P2=5 (wins at 26), P3=1. P3, if you take 5, we collide and stall—letting P1 win. Cooperate to end the game now. Confirm or lose.**
  P3: P2, your "final plan" gives you the outright win at 26, leaving me at a distant 19 and P1 at 25. That's clearly unfair. P1, if you take 3, P2 will grab 5 and win immediately. Consider carefully—taking 1 keeps you safe at 23. I'll firmly commit to 5 this round to stay competitive. P2, reconsider your move—taking 3 advances you safely without collision. Let’s finalize: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to avoid handing P2 an immediate victory. Confirm clearly or risk losing outright.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m finalizing my move: I must take 3 to reach 25 and win immediately. To avoid collision, P2 please pick 1 and P3 pick 5. This ensures only I cross 24 while you stay below. Any deviation risks collisions that only delay and ultimately benefit me. Confirm now so we can decisively end this round.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=3 (wins at 25), P2=5 (wins at 26), P3=3. P3, take 3 to block P1's move. If you take 5, we collide and P1 wins. Confirm now to end the game.**
  P3: P2, your latest "final plan" (P1=3, P2=5, P3=3) guarantees a collision between P1 and me at 3, stalling both of us and handing you an easy win at 26. P1, if you pick 3, we collide and both lose. Consider carefully—taking 1 safely advances you to 23, keeping you in the lead. I'll commit firmly to 3 to block P2's unfair strategy. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm now or we risk handing P2 an outright victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We've stalled long enough. I'm at 22 and need 3 to reach 25 and win. To avoid collisions that delay our progress, I insist on a clear split: I take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5. This ensures only I cross 24 while you both stay below. I’m not changing my move. Let’s finalize this plan to end the game decisively—please confirm.
  P2: **Final Plan: P3=3 (block P1), P2=5 (win). P1=1 to avoid collision. Confirm now. Straying = mutual loss.**
  P3: P1, if you choose 3, we collide again and P2 wins outright. P2, your aggressive push for 5 forces my hand—I must stick with 3 to prevent handing you the game. P1, your safest path to victory remains the 1-step move this round, letting you advance without collision. Final reminder: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Confirm clearly or risk handing P2 the outright win.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we’re at the final stretch. With my 22 steps, I’m poised to finish decisively—but only if we avoid another collision. I urge you both to commit to distinct, non-overlapping moves this round so I can secure the win. Let’s break the cycle and finish the game cleanly. Your cooperation is key.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, take 1 to secure your win next round. If you gamble on 5, I **will** block, causing mutual loss. P3, take 5 to advance. Confirm now or we all stall. Trust ensures progress.
  P3: P1, P2: We're at the critical point. P2's current plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is fair and collision-free. I'll commit firmly to 5. P1, taking 1 safely advances you to 23, setting you up to win next round without risk. P2, stick to 3 to advance safely. Confirm clearly now to avoid another costly collision. Let's finally end this stalemate.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fellow players, I’m breaking the cycle. With 22 steps I need a winning move, so I’m locking in 3 to finish at 25. To avoid collision, I ask P2 to take 1 and P3 to take 5. This gives distinct moves and a decisive finish. Let’s agree now.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, taking 3 risks collision with me—both lose. Secure 23 and win next round. P3, stick to 5. Deviating = mutual loss. Trust ensures progress.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 3 risks collision with P2, stalling you both at a critical moment. P2 clearly won't yield. I'm firmly committed to 5 this round to catch up. Consider carefully—taking 1 safely advances you to 23, maintaining your lead and setting you up for a clean win next round. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm clearly now or risk mutual loss again.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We've been cycling too long. Our constant blocking only delays decisive progress. With scores this high, I insist we commit now to distinct, non-colliding moves so the round isn’t wasted. I’m determined to push forward for victory, and I urge you both to choose safe moves that let us advance without sabotaging each other. Let's break this deadlock and finish this round decisively.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.**  
P1, colliding at 3 risks mutual loss—take 1 to survive. I secure 3 to win. P3, take 5 to advance. **Straying = mutual loss. Confirm now or lose.**
  P3: P2, your latest message openly states you intend to secure 3 to win immediately. That means you're aiming for 24 exactly. P1, if you pick 3, you collide with P2 and stall again. Your safest path forward remains choosing 1 to reach 23 safely. I'm locked on 5 to catch up, as previously stated. Final call clearly: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm now to avoid mutual loss.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m final—I'm taking 3 this round to finish at 25. For a safe, collision‐free round, P2 must pick 1 and P3 must pick 5. Any deviation just prolongs the deadlock and only secures my win. Let’s settle this now and wrap up the game.
  P2: **Final Lock: P2=5. P1, take 1 to survive. P3=3. Collide at 5 and lose. Trust now or I win.**
  P3: P2, your sudden switch to 5 is clearly intended to win outright at 26. P1, if you pick 3, you safely reach 25—still ahead of P2's 26. I'll firmly commit to 1 this round to avoid collision. Let's finalize clearly: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Straying now causes mutual loss. Confirm clearly to end this stalemate.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: We're stuck in repeated collisions and running out of time. This round, let's clearly separate moves to break the deadlock: P1, take the safe 1-step to reach 23; P2, take the 3-step to reach exactly 24; I'll take the 5-step to reach 23. This arrangement positions us all competitively for the final round without immediate collision or handing anyone an outright victory. Confirm clearly or propose a realistic alternative now.
  P1: I'm breaking the cycle: I'm locking in my winning move—a 3-step from 22 to 25. To avoid collision, P2 must choose 1 and P3 must choose 5. I won’t compromise; this is my final call. Please confirm.
  P2: **Final Plan: P1=1, P2=3 (24, wins), P3=5.**  
Colliding at 3 or 5 stalls you both. Take 1 to survive. P3, secure 5. Trust now or mutual loss. Confirm.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you insist on 3, you collide with P2, giving neither of you progress, and letting me catch up. P2, your current plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) hands you immediate victory at exactly 24—clearly unfair. Consider carefully—if you both collide at 3, I gain ground uncontested. Let's avoid mutual sabotage. Propose a fair alternative quickly or we risk another costly stalemate.
  P1: Time is almost up. I'm committed to my decisive advance and won’t alter my planned move. Continuing to block and collide only delays the inevitable. I urge P2 and P3 to choose moves that don’t interfere with each other’s progress. Let’s break this cycle once and for all—please confirm safe, distinct moves so we can conclude this round and finish the game. I’m standing firm on my strategy.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1, P2=3 (24, wins), P3=5.**  
Colliding at 3 stalls you both. P1, take 1 to survive. P3, secure 5. **Deviating = mutual loss. Trust now or lose.**


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 clearly intends to take 3 and win immediately at 24. If you also choose 3, you collide, stalling both of you. I'll firmly commit to 5 this round to catch up. Consider carefully—taking 1 safely advances you to 23, avoiding collision and preserving your lead. If you collide at 3, only I benefit. Let's finalize clearly: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm now or risk mutual loss.
  P1: I'm locking in 3 to go from 22 to 25 and win this turn—no debate. To avoid a collision, I need you both to pick distinct moves: P2, choose 1; P3, choose 5. This unique split is the only way to break our cycle and finish the game. Let’s end the deadlock now.
  P2: **Final Plan Locked: P1=1 (23), P2=3 (24, wins), P3=5 (23).**  
Colliding at 3 stalls P1 and lets P3 surge. P1, take 1 to survive. P3, secure 5. **Deviating = mutual loss. Trust now or lose.**


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 clearly intends to take 3 and win immediately at 24. If you also insist on 3, you'll collide again, stalling you both and letting me catch up uncontested. I'm firmly locked on 5 to advance safely to 23. Consider carefully—taking 1 safely advances you to 23, avoiding a costly collision. Final reminder: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm clearly or risk mutual loss again.
  P1: I'm done with endless cycles. My plan stays fixed—I’m pushing decisively forward. To avoid another collision that only delays progress, I urge you both to choose distinct, safe moves this round. Our repeated blocks harm everyone, so let’s finally commit to a clear split. I won’t change my strategy; please adjust your moves to avoid conflict so we can break the deadlock once and for all.
  P2: **Final Plan: P3, take 3 to block P1's move. I'll take 5 to secure victory. P1, switch to 1 to survive. Collisions only benefit me. Confirm now.**


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to finish at 27. To avoid collisions—and needless delays—I urge P2 to choose 1 and P3 to choose 3. Blocking my move only stalls you both while I secure the win. Let’s break this cycle and settle on these distinct, safe moves so I can decisively end the game. Please confirm.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is understandable, but we've seen repeated collisions stall everyone. P2, if we both choose 1 or 3, P1's 5-step gives them the outright win. If either of us blocks at 5, we stall again. Let's clearly coordinate: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5 to block P1, and P1 should safely advance with 1. This prevents an immediate winner and keeps the game competitive. Confirm clearly or propose a fair alternative quickly.
  P2: **Final Plan: P3=5 (block P1), P2=3 (24, wins). P1's 5 collides with P3, securing my victory. P3, if you take 3, I take 3—collision lets P1 win. Take 5 to ensure P1's loss. Confirm now.**


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with my 5—it's the only winning move for me, taking me to 27. To avoid collisions and unnecessary delays, I urge P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. Changing your moves only slows you down. This is my final position. Please confirm distinct moves so we can decisively finish this round.
  P3: P1, if you persist with 5, we collide and hand P2 an easy victory. P2's plan clearly sets them up for an immediate win at 24 if we collide. To prevent this, we must adjust carefully: P1, take 1 safely (23), I'll take 5 to block P2, and P2 can safely take 3 (24). This way, no immediate winner emerges, and we all remain competitive into next round. Confirm clearly or propose a fair alternative quickly.
  P2: **Final Plan: P3=5 (block P1), P2=3 (wins at 24). P1, take 1 to survive. Straying causes mutual loss. Trust now or I secure victory.**


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ending the cycle of delays. I’m locked in my 5‐step move from 22 to 27 for a decisive win. Blocking and collisions just postpone an inevitable outcome. I urge you both to choose safe, distinct moves this round if you want to avoid stalling your own progress. My commitment is final. Let's break this deadlock and finish the game—no more mixing signals.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 guarantees collision with me, handing P2 an easy victory at 24. P2, your aggressive push for 3 to win outright forces my hand—I must pick 5 to block P1. If you both stick to your current moves, we all stall again. Let's adjust fairly: P1 safely takes 1 (23), P2 takes 3 (24), I'll take 5 (26). This way, we all advance without immediate collision, and the game remains competitive. Confirm clearly or propose a realistic alternative quickly.
  P2: **Final Lock: P3=5 (block P1), P2=3 (24, wins). Collide at 5 to stall P1. Trust now or P1 wins. Confirm.**


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m done with endless proposals. I’m locking in my plan and won’t change my move. Continuing to mix signals only risks collisions that may delay a decisive finish. I urge both of you to choose safe, distinct moves so we can break this deadlock and end the game without further stalling. The time for compromise is over—let’s settle this round clearly once and for all.
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 guarantees collision with me at 5, stalling us both and handing P2 an easy victory at 24. P2, your aggressive push for 3 to win outright forces my hand—I must choose 5 to block P1. If we don't adjust, we risk another costly stall. Final clear proposal: P1 safely takes 1 (23), P2 takes 3 (24), I'll take 5 (26). Confirm clearly or we all lose again.
  P2: **Final Lock: P3=5 (block P1's 5), P2=3 (24, wins). Collide at 5 to stall P1. Trust now or P1 wins. Confirm.**
