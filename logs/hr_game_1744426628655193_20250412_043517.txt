Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep our options open for this first round. I suggest we avoid choosing the same number to ensure we all progress. Maybe we should coordinate our moves to maximize our advancement. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid choosing the same number. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5? This way, we can all move forward without collision. What do you think?
  P1: I’m fine with the plan to avoid collisions. P3’s suggestion of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 works for me. Let’s stick to this for the first round to ensure we all advance. If everyone agrees, we can move forward with this coordination.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, let's stick to P1 choosing 1, I’ll choose 3, and P3 will choose 5. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. If everyone is on board, we can finalize our choices for the move phase. What do you say?
  P3: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Let's stick to the plan and see how it goes. If it works well, we can consider similar coordination in future rounds, but we should also be prepared to adapt if needed. Looking forward to advancing together this turn!
  P1: I'm I'm glad we're aligned on this plan. Let's execute it as discussed—P1 with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. If we stick to this, we should all advance without issues. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy for the first round. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m good to proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we have a solid plan, but let's remain flexible. If we notice any hesitation or change from one of us, we should be ready to adapt our moves. Coordination is key, but we also need to ensure we’re not too predictable in future rounds. For now, let’s stick to our agreement for this round. If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices and move forward. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's point about flexibility. Let's stick to our plan for this round, but be ready to adjust in future rounds. If everyone is on board, I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. What do you say?
  P1: I'm glad we’re all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out. I think maintaining trust early on will help us strategize better in future rounds, even if we adapt later. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the teamwork so far, and I agree that sticking to our plan is important for this round. However, I also think we should keep an eye on how the others might play in future rounds. If we continue to coordinate, we should be cautious of becoming too predictable. For now, I'm ready to finalize our moves as discussed. If everyone is still good with the plan, let’s proceed to the move phase. What do you all think?
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. Let's see how it works and stay flexible for future rounds. If everyone is set, let's move to the move phase. What do you say?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our coordination worked last round, and we all advanced. Let's try to maintain this momentum. How about we switch it up this time to avoid predictability? I suggest P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This way, we can still progress without collisions. If everyone agrees, we can proceed with this plan for Round 2. What do you think? If there’s any concern or a better idea, I’m open to suggestions. Let’s keep the communication open and adapt as needed.
  P2: P1's suggestion to switch it up is a good idea to avoid predictability. However, I think we should keep our moves flexible based on our positions. I propose we stick to the original idea of avoiding collisions but consider that we might need to adapt our choices based on how the game progresses. If P1 goes for 3, I could still choose 3 or 5 to maximize my advancement. Let’s discuss our options further before finalizing. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to switch our moves to avoid predictability. However, I think P2's point about flexibility is crucial. Let's go with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and I'll choose 1 for this round. This way, we can continue to advance without collisions while staying adaptable. If anyone has a different idea or concern, let's discuss it now. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

I think this keeps us progressing while mixing things up. If P2 is still okay with 5, let's lock this in for Round 2. If there’s any hesitation or a better idea, I’m open to hear it now. Let’s keep this momentum going. If everyone’s set, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P2: I think we have a solid plan with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1. This should help us avoid collisions while still advancing. However, I want to emphasize that we should be ready to adapt if any of us feel uncertain about our choices. If everyone is comfortable with this plan, let's lock it in and move forward. What do you all think?
  P3: I'm on board with the current plan for this round—P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and me choosing 1. It's a good way to keep advancing while mixing things up.

I propose P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3 for this round. This way, we can balance our progress and avoid collisions. If anyone has concerns or a better idea, I'm open to suggestions. Let's keep the communication clear and adapt as needed. What do you think? If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to mix things up. P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and me choosing 3 sounds good to keep our progress balanced and avoid collisions. However, let's stay vigilant and ready to adapt if needed, especially since P2 is in the lead. If everyone is on board with this plan, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I like the idea of mixing it up to keep things unpredictable. However, I want to emphasize that since I'm currently in the lead, I might consider a strategy that allows me to advance more aggressively. I propose we stick to a plan that ensures we all move forward without collisions while keeping an eye on each other's positions. If we can agree on a solid strategy, I'm ready to proceed.
