Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, since it's round one, let's keep things simple and avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this round. You two can choose between 1 and 5. Fair?
  P1: P2's suggestion seems reasonable, but I'm not sure I want to commit to a specific number just yet. How about we coordinate our moves, but also keep some flexibility? If P3 agrees to take a different number than me, I'll consider taking 1 or 5. P3, what's your thought on this? Let's discuss before deciding on our moves.
  P3: I think coordinating moves is a good idea, but I don't want to reveal my choice just yet. P2 has already suggested taking 3, so I'm considering taking 5 to avoid collision and make a bigger step. P1, are you leaning towards taking 1 to minimize risk or trying to make a larger step?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, sounds like we have a rough plan shaping up. P3, your idea of taking 5 works well with my 3. If P1 picks 1, we all advance safely. P1, does that sound good to you? Let's lock this in and avoid any unnecessary collisions.
  P1: I'm considering P2's last suggestion. To avoid collision, if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5, I'll take 1. This seems like a safe plan. However, I want to make sure we're all on the same page. P3, are you confirming you'll take 5? If so, I can proceed with 1. Let's finalize our plan to ensure we all advance safely this round.
  P3: I confirm I'm considering 5, as previously mentioned. P1 and P2 seem to be on board with their respective choices. To finalize, I suggest we all implicitly agree to our discussed moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's avoid further discussion to prevent revealing too much. If everyone's ready, we can proceed with  to move to the next phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, sounds like we're all set. Trusting everyone sticks to the agreed plan. Good luck!
  P1: Since we've discussed and seemingly agreed on our moves for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), I'm ready to proceed. To confirm, P2, you're taking 3, and P3, you're taking 5. I'll take 1 as planned. Let's keep our word and stick to the plan. If everyone is ready, we can stop discussing and move to the next phase.
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. To confirm, I'll take 5. Let's keep the trust and proceed with the move phase. If everyone is satisfied with the discussion, I suggest we end the conversation phase by saying  to move on.

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we aim to avoid collisions again. P1, considering you're behind, would you take 5 to catch up, or play it safe with 1? P2, will you try to close the gap with me or maintain a steady pace? Let's discuss our strategies for this round.
  P1: To avoid collision and make progress, I suggest we diversify our moves again. P2 is now in the middle, so P2 could take 1 or 5 to avoid being stuck. P3 is ahead, so taking 1 or 3 could be a safe choice for P3 to maintain the lead without risking too much. I'll consider taking 3 or 5 to catch up or keep a reasonable pace. Let's discuss the best strategy to avoid collision and make significant progress this round.
  P2: I agree with the idea of diversifying our moves again. I'll consider either 1 or 5 this round to avoid collision. P3, since you're leading, it might be safest for you to take 1 or 3. P1, picking 3 or 5 seems reasonable for you to catch up. Let's confirm quickly so we can all advance safely again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering our positions, I propose P1 takes 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1 to avoid collision, and I'll take 3 to maintain my lead. This way, we all advance safely. What are your thoughts on this strategy, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3's proposal for Round 2 seems reasonable. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I'll consider taking 5 to catch up. This way, we avoid collision. P2, are you okay with taking 1 as proposed? P3, are you confirming you'll take 3? Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance safely this round. If we're all on the same page, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'm comfortable with P3's proposal. I'll take 1 this round as suggested, letting P1 catch up with 5 and P3 maintain the lead with 3. If everyone agrees, let's lock this in and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

P3, you're taking 3, right? If we're all set, I'll take 5 as planned. Let's keep our word and stick to the plan to ensure we all advance safely this round. If everyone is ready, we can stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm again, I'll stick to taking 1 as agreed. Trusting you both to follow through as well. Good luck!

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good teamwork so far. To avoid collisions again, let's slightly rotate our picks. Since I'm currently behind, I'd appreciate taking 5 this round to catch up. P3, perhaps you could take 1 to play it safe and maintain your lead, and P1, you could take 3 to keep a steady pace. Does this sound fair to everyone?
  P1: P2's suggestion for Round 3 is reasonable, but I need to consider my position. Taking 3 is a moderate step. If P3 takes 1, it minimizes risk. However, if P2 takes 5 and I take 3, there's a collision risk. I'll consider an alternative: what if I take 5 and P2 takes 3? This way, P2 can still catch up, and I can make a significant step. P2, are you open to swapping our numbers?
  P3: Considering P2's suggestion and P1's alternative, I think P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3 could work. However, I must prioritize maintaining my lead. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, I could take 1 to ensure a safe advance. Let's discuss the risks and benefits of this approach. P1, are you committed to taking 5 if P2 takes 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to swapping numbers as P1 suggestedâ€”I'll take 3 if P1 commits to taking 5. P3, taking 1 seems safest for you to maintain your lead. If everyone confirms this, we can finalize quickly.
  P1: To finalize our plan for Round 3, I'm willing to take 5 if P2 takes 3. P3, if you take 1, we can all advance safely. P2, please confirm you're taking 3 as discussed. I'll proceed with 5 if you're committed. Let's keep our word and stick to the plan to avoid collision. If we're all set, we can stop discussing and move to the next phase.
  P3: I confirm taking 1 is my safest option to maintain the lead. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3 as discussed, I'll stick to 1. Let's finalize our plan to ensure safe advancement for all. Are we ready to proceed with the agreed moves: P1 (5), P2 (3), and me (1)?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with taking 3 this round as discussed. Trusting everyone to follow through. Good luck!
  P1: To finalize, let's confirm our moves one last time. P2, you've agreed to take 3, and P3, you're taking 1. I'll take 5 as planned. If we're all committed, we should be good to go. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Let's keep our word and stick to the plan. If everyone is satisfied, let's end the conversation here by saying .
  P3: Let's review our agreed plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all advance safely. I'll stick to 1 to maintain my lead. Are we all set to proceed with the move phase, or is there a need for further discussion?

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great cooperation so far. I'm currently behind, so I'd appreciate the chance to take 5 this round to catch up. P1, you're ahead, so perhaps you could safely take 1. P3, taking 3 would let you maintain a steady pace. Does this sound good to both of you?
  P3: I'm considering P2's suggestion, but I also want to maintain my lead. Taking 3 might be a safer option for me. P1, are you willing to take 1 as P2 proposed, or do you have another strategy in mind? Let's discuss to avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: To progress safely in Round 4, I consider P2's suggestion. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P3, taking 3 is a reasonable choice to maintain a steady pace. However, to minimize risk, I'll propose an alternative: if P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, I'll take 1. This way, P2 can still catch up, and P3 can make a bigger step. P2 and P3, are you open to this alternative? Let's finalize our moves to ensure safe advancement.

  P1: To progress safely in Round 5, I will consider P3's suggestion. However, taking 5 might risk a collision if P2 doesn't take 1. I'll propose an alternative: if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I'll take a different number to avoid collision. P2, are you willing to take 1 as previously suggested? If so, I'll consider taking 5. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance safely this round.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's alternative plan is intriguing, but I need to consider the risks. If P3 takes 5 and I take 3, it could put me ahead or keep me close.
