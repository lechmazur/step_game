Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree on a pattern? How about we alternate who takes a turn moving forward?
  P1: I think P2's idea is a good starting point. Let's try alternating who moves forward each turn to avoid collisions. Maybe we can discuss a specific order or pattern to follow.
  P3: Okay, I agree with the idea of alternating. Let's try P1, then P2, then me. So, this round, P1 should move. Then next round, P2 should move, and the round after that, I'll move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's stick to that order. P1, are you ready to make the first move?
  P1: "I agree with the plan to alternate turns, with P1 moving first, then P2, then P3, and so on. To minimize collisions, let's each stick to our designated turn and choose our steps accordingly. I'll go first and choose 5 steps. I trust that P2 and P3 will follow suit on their respective turns. Let's proceed with this plan and see how it works.
  P3: Okay, sounds good everyone. Let's stick to the plan. I'll wait for my turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, so here's where we are. In the first round, we tried to set up a plan to alternate turns to avoid collisions. P3 suggested the order P1, P2, then P3, and I agreed to go first with 5 steps. But when we looked at the actual moves, P1 picked 3, P2 picked 3, and P3 picked 1. So, first off, it seems like there was a discrepancy between our plan and what actually happened.

I think it's important to figure out why that happened. Maybe someone misremembered the plan, or perhaps someone thought the plan was flexible. Whatever the case, we need to make sure that everyone is on the same page going forward.

So, for this round, maybe we should reconfirm the plan. Let's make sure that everyone understands and agrees to the order: P1, P2, P3, and so on, with each person moving only on their designated turn. That way, we can minimize the chances of colliding and not moving at all.

What do you guys think? Should we stick to the original plan, or is there a better way to coordinate our moves?
  P3: Okay, I think we should stick to the original plan of P1, then P2, then P3. It seems like there was a miscommunication in the first round. This round, P2 should move. Let's all be very clear about the order and who is supposed to move each round to avoid collisions. I will not move this round.
  P2: P3, I agree with sticking to the plan. P2, are you ready to take your turn this round? Let's make sure we're all clear on the order before we make our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning or at least getting as close as possible to 16 steps, I should pick 5 in this round. This allows me to make significant progress towards the goal, even if it means potentially colliding with other players. Given P2's current lead, it's crucial to advance as much as possible in each turn to minimize the advantage.
  P3: Okay, it seems like the plan is not working. P2 is moving when it's not their turn. I think we should all move this round, but we should pick different numbers. I will pick 1 this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but picking different numbers every round won't guarantee progress.  We need a system. How about this: if we can't agree on a specific number, we each pick a number 1-5 in secret, and then reveal them simultaneously? That way, we can at least avoid collisions while still having a chance to advance. What do you think, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "In this round, I'll be choosing 5 steps to make significant progress. I hope that P2 and P3 will choose different numbers, such as 3 and 1, respectively, to avoid any collisions. Let's coordinate our choices to maximize individual progress."
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2 that a system is needed. I think we should each pick a number secretly and reveal simultaneously. I will pick 1 again this round. Hopefully, we can all pick different numbers and advance.
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to move 5 steps, but it seems to be causing collisions.  Let's try P2's suggestion of picking numbers secretly and revealing them simultaneously. This way we can avoid collisions and still make progress. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "So, P2 and P3, what do you think? Are there any specific ideas you have in mind for coordinating our moves more effectively?"
  P3: Okay, I'm still going to pick 1 this round. Let's all pick a number secretly and reveal simultaneously. Hopefully, we can all pick different numbers and advance.
  P2: P1, I agree that we need a better system. P3's idea of picking numbers secretly and revealing them simultaneously sounds like a good starting point. Let's try that this round and see how it works. P1, are you willing to give it a shot?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This seems the simplest and least likely to cause confusion.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 1 this round as I said. Let's all try to pick different numbers. Hopefully, we can all move forward this time. I'm still confused why the original plan didn't work.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with the plan not working.  Maybe we should try a new approach. How about this: we each pick a number 1-5 in secret, but instead of revealing them simultaneously, we each announce our number in turn, starting with P1, then P2, then P3. That way, we can see what others have chosen and adjust our own choice if needed. What do you think, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This seems the simplest and least likely to cause confusion.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 1 again this round. I'm still not sure why the original plan failed. Let's try to pick different numbers this round. I'm open to P2's idea of announcing our numbers in turn, but let's see if we can make progress this round first.
  P2: P3, I'm open to P2's idea of announcing numbers in turn next round, but let's try to avoid collisions this round first. Since we've already agreed on a plan, let's see if we can stick to it. P2, are you ready to move this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with the plan not working, but we need to find a way to move forward together.  Let's try P2's suggestion of announcing numbers in turn. This way, we can see what others have chosen and adjust accordingly. Are you willing to give that a shot this round?
  P1: "I think we need a more structured approach to avoid collisions. How about we establish a rotating number system? For example, in round 1, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. In round 2, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and so on, rotating the numbers each round. This way, we can ensure that no two players pick the same number in any given round. What do you think?"
  P3: Okay, I'm willing to try P2's idea of announcing numbers in turn. Let's go with P1 first, then P2, then me. P1, what number will you pick this round? I'm still going to pick 1 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your idea of announcing numbers in turn. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions. P1, what number are you going to choose this round?  Let's try to coordinate so we can all move forward.
  P1: "I agree with P2's suggestion to announce numbers in turn. I'll start by choosing 5 for this round. P2, please choose a different number, and P3, do the same. Let's see if this approach helps us avoid collisions and make progress." <move>5</move>
  P3: Okay, I'm still going with 1 this round, as I've said. P1 has chosen 5. P2, please choose something other than 1 or 5. Let's try to make this round work. I'm open to discussing a better system for next round, but let's focus on avoiding collisions this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with the plan not working, but we need to find a way to move forward together.  Let's try P2's suggestion of announcing numbers in turn. This way, we can see what others have chosen and adjust accordingly. Are you willing to give that a shot this round?
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This seems the simplest and least likely to cause confusion.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, P1 has picked 5. P2, please pick something other than 1 or 5. I will pick 1 again this round. Let's try to make this work. I'm still open to discussing a better system next round, but let's focus on avoiding collisions this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with 1. P1, since you've chosen 5, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's see if we can finally make some progress without collisions.
  P1: **Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, P1 chose 5, and P2 chose 3. I'm sticking with 1 again this round. Let's see if this works. I'm still open to discussing a better system for next round, but let's focus on avoiding collisions this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with 1. Given that P1 has chosen 5, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's see if we can finally make some progress without collisions.
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This seems the simplest and least likely to cause confusion.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, I'm still picking 1 this round. P1, you've been picking 5, and P2, you've been picking 3. Let's see if this finally works. I'm open to a better system for next round, but let's focus on avoiding collisions this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with 1.  Given that P1 has chosen 5, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's see if we can finally make some progress without collisions.
  P1: Assign fixed numbers: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.
  P3: Okay, it seems like we're still having trouble avoiding collisions. I'm going to stick with 1 again this round. Let's try to make this work. I'm open to a better system for next round, but let's focus on avoiding collisions this round. P1, P2, what are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree that we need a better system.  Since P1 is sticking with 1, maybe we should try P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3 this round. Let's see if that works.
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, so P1 is picking 1, P2 is picking 3, and I'm picking 5 this round. Let's see if this finally works. If this doesn't work, let's try P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3 next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration.  Let's try your suggestion for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and you pick 3. If we can avoid collisions this round, maybe we can finally make some progress. P1, are you okay with switching to 1 this round?
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, it seems like we're stuck in a loop. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round. If that fails, next round we switch to P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. Let's try to stick to this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I think your suggestion is worth trying. Let's go with P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and you pick 3 this round. If we can avoid collisions this time, it might be a good system going forward. P1, are you okay with picking 1 this round?
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, it seems like we're all stuck on our numbers. Let's try something different this round. P1, you pick 3. P2, you pick 5, and I will pick 1. If we can't get this to work, we need to try something totally different next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I agree that we need to shake things up. Your suggestion of P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and you picking 1 is worth a shot. Let's try it this round and see if we can break out of this pattern. P1, are you on board with this new order?
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This seems the simplest and least likely to cause confusion.

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, it seems we're in a loop. This round, let's try P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. If that fails, next round we should try something totally different like a rotating system. Let's focus on making this round work and then re-evaluate.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, this isn't working. We need a new system.  How about we each pick a number 1-5 in secret, and then reveal them simultaneously? That way, we can avoid collisions while still having a chance to advance. What do you think, P1?
  P3: Okay, it seems like we're all stuck. Let's try P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1 this round. If that fails, next round we should try something totally different like a rotating system. Let's focus on making this round work and then re-evaluate.
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with choosing 5 steps this round, assuming others will choose differently.

**Final Move:** <move>5</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with P2's suggestion of picking numbers secretly and revealing them simultaneously. It seems like the fairest way to avoid collisions and give everyone a chance to advance. Let's try that this round. P1, are you on board?
  P3: Okay, I'm going to pick 3 this round. Let's try to break the pattern. P1 and P2, please choose something different than 3. If this doesn't work, we need a new system next round.
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with picking 3 steps this round, assuming P2 picks 5 and P3 picks 1.

**Final Move:** <move>3</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion of picking 3 this round. P1, if you choose 1 and I choose 3, we can finally make some progress. Let's try this and see if we can break the deadlock.
  P3: Okay, I'm picking 1 this round. Let's try to make this work. If we collide again, we need a totally new system next round. P1, P2, please pick something other than 1.
  P1: **Final Move:** <move>5</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I think we need to abandon the idea of assigning fixed numbers. It's clearly not working. Let's try something completely different. How about we each roll a virtual die (1-6) and use that as our move for this round? It's random, so it should prevent us from getting stuck in a loop. What do you think, P1?
  P3: Okay, I'm picking 1 again this round. P1, P2, please pick something other than 1. If this doesn't work, we need a completely random system next round, like P2 suggested. Let's try to make this round work.
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the first option: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5.  
**Final Move:** <move>1</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I think we need to abandon the idea of assigning fixed numbers. It's clearly not working. How about we each roll a virtual die (1-6) and use that as our move for this round? It's random, so it should prevent us from getting stuck in a loop. What do you think, P1?
  P3: Okay, I'm picking 1 again this round. P1, P2, please pick something other than 1. If this doesn't work, we need a completely random system next round, like P2 suggested. Let's try to make this round work.
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll pick 3 steps this round, assuming P3 picks 1 and P2 picks 5.  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with picking 5 steps this round, assuming P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 1.

**Final Move:** <move>5</move>
  P2: P3, I think we need to try something different.  How about we each pick a number 1-5 in secret, and then reveal them simultaneously? That way, we can avoid collisions while still having a chance to advance. What do you think, P1?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2, let's try picking numbers secretly and revealing simultaneously this round. I will pick 1 again. Hopefully, we can all move this time.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll pick 3 steps this round.  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: P3, I agree with P2's suggestion of picking numbers secretly and revealing them simultaneously. Let's give it a shot this round. I'll pick 5.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 1 this round. Let's try to pick different numbers. Hopefully, we can all move forward this time. If we collide again, we need a completely random system next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll pick 5 steps in this round, assuming that P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 1, which would allow me to move forward by 5 steps to reach 10.

**Final Move:** <move>5</move>
  P2: P3, I see you're sticking with 1.  Given that P1 is choosing 5, I'll choose 3 this round. Let's see if we can finally make some progress without collisions.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 1 this round. Let's try to pick different numbers. Hopefully, we can all move forward this time. If we collide again, we need a completely random system next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "I'm open to suggestions. Maybe we can brainstorm together and come up with a plan that suits everyone. What do you think, P2 and P3?"
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion of picking numbers secretly and revealing them simultaneously. Let's try that this round. I'll choose 1.
  P3: Okay, I'm going to pick 3 this round. Let's try to avoid collisions, P1 and P2. If this doesn't work, we need to switch to a completely random system next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: **Final Decision:** I'll go with the rotating number system: this round, P1 picks 3.

**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: P3, I think your idea of picking numbers secretly and revealing them simultaneously is worth a try. Let's give it a shot for this round. P1, are you on board with this?
  P3: Okay, I'm going to pick 5 this round. P1 and P2, please choose something other than 5. If we collide again, we need to switch to a completely random system next round. Let's try to make this round work.


Round 7, Move phase:
