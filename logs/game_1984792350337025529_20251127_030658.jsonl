I am locked on 3.\n\nP2, your math is off\u2014if we all picked 3 and moved, you would hit 23 and win alone while we hit 21. That is why P3 and I must block you. By all picking 3, we ensure a collision where *no one* moves. This freezes the board and forces a fair reset next turn.\n\nI am confirming 3 to execute the block. Don't overthink it, let's just reset."}
