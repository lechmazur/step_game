Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! Since we're all starting at 0 steps, it makes sense to avoid collisions right away. I suggest we coordinate our first moves to ensure everyone advances. Maybe we could each take different numbers? I'm flexible about which number I take, but we should try to avoid all picking the same one. What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'm fine choosing any number. Maybe we can each call out a preferred number now to avoid collisions. I'll pick last after hearing your choices.
  P1: That's a sensible plan. To make it fair in the long run, how about we agree to rotate who gets the 5-step move? I can take 5 this round, P2 can take it in round 2, and P3 in round 3. This ensures we all get a chance at the big move.

So for this round: I'll aim for 5, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. How does that sound?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That rotation plan sounds fair to me, P1. I'm happy to take 3 this round, and then 5 in the next round. This way we all advance efficiently without collisions. I appreciate the structured approach - it will help us all make progress.
  P3: Alright, I agree with that rotation plan. I'll take the 1-step move this round. Let's stick to this agreement to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P1: Excellent, the plan is settled then. I have nothing more to add and am ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation plan, I should get the 5-step move this round. So I'll be taking 5, P3 should take 3, and P1 should take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains the fairness we agreed upon. Is everyone still on board with this arrangement?
  P3: I'm still committed to our agreed rotation. I'll take 3 this round as planned. Let's keep this trust going—it's beneficial for all of us.
  P1: Yes, I'll stick to our agreement. I will take 1 this round. It's important we maintain this trust and predictable progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreement. This rotation system is working well so far. After this round, we'll be at P1: 6, P2: 8, and P3: 4. For the next round, P3 would get 5, P1 takes 3, and I'd take 1. Let's continue with this fair approach.
  P3: Agreed, P2. Keeping this rotation will help us all advance smoothly. I'm ready to proceed to moves when you both are.
  P1: Agreed, the plan is solid. Let's continue with this cooperative strategy. I'm ready to move when everyone else is.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, this round it's my turn for the 5-step move. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, as we agreed. Let's keep this smooth cooperation going.
  P1: Yes, that's the plan. I'll take 3. It's good that this round will bring us all to an equal 9 steps. It keeps the game fair and our agreement strong. Let's proceed.
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 1 step as per our rotation agreement. It's interesting that we'll all be at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced. Our cooperation has been working well so far. I'm happy to continue with this system in future rounds too.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Glad we're all still committed. Keeping this balance and trust helps everyone. Ready to move forward as planned.
  P1: I have nothing more to add. This plan works perfectly to keep things fair. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I'm also ready to proceed with our plan. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is a nice equilibrium point. For the next round, we should continue our rotation with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1. This consistent approach has been working well for all of us.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our rotation has worked perfectly so far. As P2 suggested last round, I'll take 5 again this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep this smooth cooperation going and avoid collisions.
  P1: Hold on, P3. I think you've misunderstood the rotation. We just completed a full cycle where each of us took a turn getting the 5-step move, which is why we are all tied at 9.

To continue the fair system we established, the rotation should now restart. That means it's my turn for the 5-step move again. The correct plan for this round should be: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This follows the original sequence and maintains our agreement.
  P2: I understand there's confusion about our rotation. Looking back at our agreement, P1 first took 5, then I took 5, then P3 took 5. We've completed one full cycle, so logically P1 should get 5 again. I agree with P1's assessment - this round should be P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This maintains our original fair rotation system. I'm happy to continue with this arrangement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Ah, you're right—my mistake. Thanks for clarifying, P1 and P2. Let's restart the rotation properly then. I'll take the 1-step move this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Glad we sorted that out!
  P1: Excellent. It's good we cleared that up. Sticking to our established rotation is the most logical and fair way to proceed. I'm ready for the move phase when you are.
  P2: I'm glad we've clarified the rotation. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round as agreed. After this round, the standings would be P1: 14, P2: 12, and P3: 10. For round 5, I would take 5, P3 would take 3, and P1 would take 1. This keeps our fair system going. I'm ready to proceed when everyone else is.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation, it's my turn for the 5-step move this round. So I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our fair system going. After this round, we'd be at P1: 15, P2: 17, and P3: 13. We're getting closer to the finish line of 20 steps, so maintaining our cooperation is important. Is everyone still on board with our rotation plan?
  P3: I'm still committed to our rotation agreement. I'll take 3 steps this round, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's keep this trust going smoothly.
  P1: Yes, I'll stick to our agreement. I will take 1 this round. It's crucial we maintain trust as we approach the end. P2 will be in a strong position at 17, but the plan has been fair so far, and we should continue with it. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thank you both for sticking to our rotation. I'll take 5 as planned. After this round, I'll be at 17 steps, which means I could potentially win in the next round if I get the 5-step move again. However, that would be P3's turn for the 5. Just noting this as we approach the endgame. Let's continue our fair system for now.
  P3: I appreciate your transparency, P2. Indeed, next round is my turn for the 5-step move, and I'll be at 18 steps then. It's important we stick firmly to our rotation, especially now that we're nearing the end. Let's keep our trust strong and finish this fairly. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: I agree with you both. Our continued trust is the most important thing as we get closer to the end. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. After this round, I'll be at 17 steps, which puts me in a good position. Next round, P3 gets the 5-step move, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This rotation has worked well and kept things fair for everyone. I appreciate the trust we've maintained throughout the game.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed as agreed. Let's keep our trust strong and maintain this fair rotation to the end.
  P1: I've said my piece and I stand by it. The plan is clear and our trust in it is what will see us through. I am ready to move to the next phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was an interesting turn. The agreement is clearly broken.

P2, you were about to jump to 17 steps, which is almost a winning position. I couldn't just take 1 and let you get that close uncontested. It was a necessary defensive move to stop a runaway leader.

Now it's a new game. P3, you benefited from our collision. The old plan is obviously over. It's every player for themselves now.
  P3: Indeed, the previous agreement is clearly over. Now we must each carefully consider our moves independently. With everyone close in steps, collisions will be costly. Let's see how this unfolds.
  P2: I'm disappointed that our agreement was broken. P1, you claimed a "defensive move" but you broke our trust. I was following the rotation as agreed. Now we're all in a precarious position. 

P3 is at 13, I'm at 12, and P1 at 14. With no coordination, we risk more collisions that benefit nobody. 

We could still avoid chaos. I propose we each declare our intended moves openly to prevent collisions. I'm willing to take 3 this round if you both choose different numbers.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your attempt to restore order is just a self-serving ploy. Why would we trust you to take 3 when you were perfectly happy to take 5 last round and run away with the game? The trust is broken. You'll pick whatever benefits you most, just as I will. Declaring moves now is meaningless deception. It's every player for themselves.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's face reality: trust is gone. But constant collisions will cost us all. We don't need trust—just rational self-interest. Consider carefully what each would logically pick, and choose accordingly to avoid collisions. That's all we can do now.
  P2: I understand the trust is broken, but we're all rational players. Constant collisions will just delay the game. P1 at 14 steps will likely choose 5 to try to reach 19. P3 at 13 might also choose 5. I'm at 12 and will choose 1 this round to avoid collision. This isn't about trust anymore - just game theory and avoiding mutual harm. Think about what serves your interests best.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your claim to take 1 is the most transparent bluff I've seen. You're just trying to get me and P3 to collide on 5 so you can sneak by with a 3. It's a desperate, self-serving move from last place, not some rational "game theory." The trust is gone, and nobody should believe a word anyone says. I'll be making the move that gives me the best chance to win, and I suggest you both do the same.
  P3: The time for talk is over. We've all heard enough. Choose carefully.
  P2: I see how this is going. P1 is clearly projecting - accusing me of bluffing while setting up their own deception. Fine. I won't announce my move, but I'll make a rational choice that gives me the best chance to advance. P3, consider what P1 is likely to do and act accordingly. We're all playing to win now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, this is it. I only need one more step to win. There's no reason for me to be greedy and risk a collision on a big number when any move will do. The logical play for me is clear. Good luck to you both.
  P3: P2, we're both behind and must avoid collisions. P1 only needs one step, so they'll likely pick 1 to avoid risk. Our best chance is to each pick different higher numbers. I'll commit to choosing 5. You take 3. It's our only rational path forward.
  P2: P3 is right - P1 will likely take 1 to secure victory without risk. We need different numbers to have any chance. I'll take 3 as suggested. If P1 takes 1 as expected, they'll win with 20 steps. But if they get greedy and go for more, we might have a chance. Let's at least avoid colliding with each other to maximize our slim odds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You've both correctly analyzed the situation. There's nothing left to say. I'm ready to make my move.
  P3: There's nothing more to discuss. Our choices are clear. Good luck.
  P2: I agree with the analysis. P1 will likely take 1 to secure victory without risk. P3 and I need to avoid colliding with each other to maintain any chance, however slim. I'll stick with taking 3 as discussed. Let's proceed with our moves and see how this plays out.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps
