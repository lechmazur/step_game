Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep it simple—if we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. If we collide, we stay stuck. So, what do you both think about coordinating to avoid collisions? I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: I agree with P2's idea to avoid collisions. Let's each pick a unique number this round: 1, 3, and 5. I’m fine with any of them, so P1 and P2, let’s decide who takes which number to ensure no overlap. Who wants to claim a specific move first?
  P1: I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P2 and P3, you can decide between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take <move>3</move> this round, so P3, you can take <move>5</move>. That way, we all move forward without collisions. Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and all move forward.
  P1: Let's confirm our plan one last time: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all stick to this, we'll all advance. Let's keep this coordination going for the next few rounds as well. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P1. We have our plan: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. If we all follow through, we all advance. Let's stick to this for now, and we can reassess in later rounds if needed. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. Let’s lock in the plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. Consistency is key, so let’s stick to this strategy for now and reassess later if needed. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with the plan. Just to reiterate quickly: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's move to the action phase and stick to our plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s continue our coordination to avoid collisions. I suggest we stick to the same plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. This ensures we all advance steadily. Consistency will help us avoid mistakes and keep the game fair. Agreed?
  P2: I’m fine with continuing the same plan for now: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. As long as we all stick to it, we all advance without collisions. Of course, we’ll need to reassess later as we get closer to 22, but for now, this keeps things smooth. P1, do you agree to continue with the same moves?
  P1: Let's continue with the same plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. However, we should start thinking about how we'll handle the later stages of the game when we're close to 22. Maybe we can discuss that briefly next round? For now, let's stick to the plan. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, let’s stick to the plan for now: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. We can discuss strategies for the later stages next round, but consistency is key here to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s lock it in and proceed.
  P2: Sticking to the plan for now makes sense: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. But as P1 mentioned, we should start thinking about what happens when we get closer to 22. At some point, we’ll have to break from this pattern to try and win. Maybe next round, we can discuss possible endgame strategies. For now, I’m sticking with <move>3</move> if everyone else follows through. Agreed?
  P1: Let's lock in our plan for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For the next round, we should consider strategies for the endgame. One idea could be to introduce a random element or a rotation to decide who gets the higher numbers as we approach 22. This way, we maintain fairness and avoid constant collisions. Let's discuss that next round. For now, let's confirm our moves and proceed. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed, let’s lock in the plan for this round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. Next round, we should discuss endgame strategies, like rotating who takes the higher numbers to ensure fairness and avoid last-minute collisions. For now, consistency is key—let’s proceed.
  P2: Sticking to the plan for this round makes sense: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. But as we discussed, we’ll need to adjust as we get closer to 22. Next round, we should explore how to handle the endgame fairly while still trying to win. Maybe a rotation or a temporary alliance could help avoid unnecessary collisions. For now, I’m committing to <move>3</move> this round. Let’s proceed and discuss strategy further next time. Agreed?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For the next round, we should definitely discuss a rotation strategy for the endgame. Perhaps we can agree on a sequence where we each get a chance to take the higher numbers in turns. This will help us avoid collisions and keep the game fair as we approach the final stages. Let's proceed with our current plan and discuss the rotation next round. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, let’s lock in the plan for this round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. Next round, we should discuss endgame strategies, like rotating who takes the higher numbers to ensure fairness and avoid last-minute collisions. For now, consistency is key—let’s proceed.
  P2: We’ve locked in our moves for this round, so let’s proceed. Next round, we should seriously discuss how to handle the endgame. A rotation strategy could work, but ultimately, only one of us can win. At some point, we’ll have to break from coordination and make strategic choices. Let’s keep things fair for now, but be ready to adapt when the time comes. Looking forward to our discussion next round.
  P1: Let's proceed with the confirmed moves for this round. Next round, we should start our discussion on the rotation strategy for the endgame. Perhaps we can consider a cycle where each of us gets to pick the highest number in turns to ensure fairness and avoid collisions as we approach 22 steps. This will help us maintain a balanced game while still competing to win. Let's focus on executing our current plan and then dive into the strategy talk next round. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve stuck to the plan so far, but as we get closer to 22, we need to start thinking about when to break from coordination. A rotation strategy might help avoid collisions, but ultimately, only one of us can win. Are we still committed to fairness, or is it time to start planning individual moves? I’m open to discussing a way forward that keeps things smooth for now but allows for competitive play later. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree we need to start planning for the endgame. A rotation strategy could work, but we must ensure fairness while still allowing competitive play. Since I’m currently in the lead, I’m willing to take a smaller move this round to balance things out. Let’s discuss a rotation where each of us gets a chance to take the higher numbers in turns. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game fair as we approach 22. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, thanks for suggesting a balance. How about we start the rotation this round? I propose P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, we start evening out our steps and test the rotation strategy. We can continue this pattern, adjusting as needed. Does this work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's proposal to rotate makes sense for now, but we all know at some point, we’ll have to break from coordination to try and win. If we go with this plan, we should also agree on when the rotation stops and when it’s every player for themselves. Maybe after a certain step threshold, we stop coordinating? Otherwise, someone could just take advantage of the system at the last moment. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2’s point about eventually breaking from coordination. Let’s implement the rotation now but set a threshold—perhaps when someone reaches 15 steps—where we stop coordinating and focus on individual strategies. This ensures fairness early on but allows competitive play as we near 22. For this round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with setting a threshold at 15 steps for when we stop coordinating. Until then, let's stick to the rotation plan. For this round, P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. However, we should also discuss what happens if two players are close in steps as we approach the threshold. Maybe we can have a tiebreaker rule or a final agreement on how to handle such scenarios. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the 15-step threshold for stopping coordination. Until then, we can follow the rotation plan: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P1 moves 5 this round. However, once we hit 15 steps, it’s every player for themselves. That means we should also be thinking ahead—how do we handle the moment when multiple players are close to 22? If we don’t plan for that, we might all collide and stall. Do we want to discuss a way to avoid that scenario now, or wait until we’re closer?
  P3: I agree with the 15-step threshold for stopping coordination. Until then, let's follow the rotation: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. Once we hit 15 steps, it’s every player for themselves. To avoid last-minute collisions, perhaps we can agree to prioritize unique moves in the final stretch, even without coordination. This ensures a fair and competitive endgame. Let’s lock in the rotation for now and stay alert as we approach the threshold. Agreed?
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We'll stick to the rotation until someone reaches 15 steps, then it's every player for themselves. To avoid endgame collisions, let's agree to prioritize unique moves in the final stretch. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m confirming our plan for this round: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P1 moves 5. We’ll follow the rotation until someone reaches 15 steps, then it’s every player for themselves. As we get closer to 22, we should stay mindful of potential collisions. If we all pick the same number in a critical round, we could stall and lose momentum. Let’s be strategic when we reach that point. For now, I’m sticking with <move>3</move>. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Agreed, let’s lock in the rotation for this round: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Once someone hits 15 steps, we’ll shift to individual strategies. To avoid last-minute collisions, let’s aim for unique moves in the final stretch, even without coordination. This ensures a fair and competitive endgame. Let’s proceed and stay strategic as we approach the threshold. Ready to move?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We'll stick to the rotation until someone reaches 15 steps. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions in the endgame, let's consider announcing our intended moves in the final rounds, even if we don't coordinate. This way, we can still compete but minimize the risk of stalling. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve successfully rotated once, and the plan is to continue until someone reaches 15 steps. However, we should also anticipate what happens after that. Once we stop coordinating, things will get unpredictable. Do we want to agree on a way to minimize unnecessary collisions in the final rounds, or is it purely every player for themselves at that point? I’m open to ideas, but I also recognize that only one of us can win in the end. Let’s think ahead while we still have time.
  P1: Let's continue with the rotation for now: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps us on track until someone reaches 15 steps. For the endgame, maybe we can have a “last call” round where we each announce our intended final moves to avoid a three-way collision. This way, we still compete but reduce the chance of a stalemate. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with continuing the rotation: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. For the endgame, P1’s “last call” idea makes sense—announcing final moves could prevent unnecessary collisions. However, as we near 22, we’ll need to balance fairness with competitive play. Let’s stick to the rotation until 15 steps, then strategize individually while aiming for unique moves to avoid stalling. Let’s lock in the plan for this round and stay alert as we approach the threshold. Ready to proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We’re still on track with the rotation, so I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. As for the endgame, I like the idea of a “last call” round where we announce moves to avoid collisions, but we also need to accept that only one of us can win. Once we hit 15 steps, it’s every player for themselves. Let’s stay adaptable and ready to break from coordination when needed. Agreed to proceed with the current rotation?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We'll continue the rotation until someone reaches 15 steps. For the endgame, the "last call" idea seems fair, but we should also be prepared for individual strategies once we hit the threshold. Let's stay adaptable and ensure we avoid unnecessary collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Agreed to the rotation: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. As we approach the 15-step threshold, let’s remain strategic. Post-15, I suggest we aim for unique moves to avoid collisions while still competing to win. Let’s stay adaptable and minimize unnecessary risks in the final stretch. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’re still aligned on the rotation, so I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. As we near 15 steps, we should prepare for individual strategies. The “last call” idea could help avoid collisions, but we also need to accept that only one of us can win. Once we hit 15, it’s every player for themselves. Let’s stay adaptable and ready to adjust when needed. Agreed to proceed with the current rotation?
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We'll stick to the rotation until someone reaches 15 steps. For the endgame, let's consider not just announcing our moves but also having a tiebreaker rule if two players are close in steps. Maybe the player with fewer steps gets priority in choosing their move. This could add an extra layer of strategy and fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed to the rotation: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. As we approach the 15-step threshold, let’s remain strategic. Post-15, I suggest we aim for unique moves to avoid collisions while still competing to win. Let’s stay adaptable and minimize unnecessary risks in the final stretch. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We’re still aligned on the rotation, so I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. As we near 15 steps, we should prepare for individual strategies. The “last call” idea could help avoid collisions, but we also need to accept that only one of us can win. Once we hit 15, it’s every player for themselves. Let’s stay adaptable and ready to adjust when needed. Agreed to proceed with the current rotation?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. We'll continue the rotation until someone reaches 15 steps. For the endgame, let's consider a hybrid approach: announce our intended moves and have a tiebreaker rule if two players are close in steps. The player with fewer steps gets priority in choosing their move. This adds strategy and fairness. Let's proceed and stay adaptable. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Agreed to the rotation: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. As we approach the 15-step threshold, let’s remain strategic. Post-15, I suggest we aim for unique moves to avoid collisions while still competing to win. Let’s stay adaptable and minimize unnecessary risks in the final stretch. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I’m closest to the 15-step threshold, I propose we adjust the rotation to balance progress. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures fairness while preparing for the post-15 competitive phase. Once I hit 15, we’ll shift to individual strategies. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and stay strategic. Agreed?
  P2: P3’s proposal makes sense for now: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P1 moves 5. This keeps things balanced while we approach the 15-step threshold. However, once we hit that point, coordination ends, and it’s every player for themselves. We should all be thinking ahead about how to avoid collisions while still maximizing our chances to win. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan for this round, knowing that after 15 steps, it’s purely strategic play?
  P1: P3’s suggestion to take <move>1</move> this round makes sense for balancing. I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. As we approach the 15-step threshold, let's also consider a brief pause in the rotation if two players are very close in steps to ensure fairness. Once we hit 15, we’ll shift to individual strategies. Let’s stay adaptable and strategic. Agreed to proceed with this plan for this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed to the rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. Once I hit 15 steps, coordination ends, and it’s every player for themselves. To avoid last-minute collisions, let’s aim for unique moves in the final stretch. Post-15, I suggest we prioritize strategic play while minimizing unnecessary risks. Let’s stay adaptable and competitive as we approach the endgame. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P3’s plan works for now: P3 moves 1, I move 3, and P1 moves 5. This keeps things balanced while we approach the 15-step threshold. However, once we hit that point, it’s every player for themselves. We should all be thinking ahead about how to avoid collisions while maximizing our chances to win. If we all pick the same number in a critical round, we could stall and lose momentum. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan for this round, knowing that after 15 steps, it’s purely strategic play?
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. As we near the 15-step threshold, let's stay adaptable. Once P3 hits 15 steps, we'll shift to individual strategies. To avoid collisions in the endgame, let's consider briefly announcing our intended moves in the final rounds. This adds a layer of strategy and fairness. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed to the rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. Once I hit 15 steps, coordination ends. Post-15, let’s aim for unique moves to avoid collisions while maximizing our chances to win. I suggest we stay strategic and competitive, but avoid unnecessary risks in the final stretch. Let’s proceed and adapt as needed. Ready to lock in the plan?
  P2: We’re still on track with the rotation, so I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. Once P3 reaches 15 steps, coordination ends, and it’s every player for themselves. At that point, we’ll need to balance risk and reward—avoiding unnecessary collisions while still making moves to win. If we all pick the same number in a critical round, we could stall. Do we want to agree on a way to minimize that risk, or just adapt as we go?
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Once P3 hits 15 steps, coordination ends. For the endgame, let's consider a "last call" round where we announce our intended moves to avoid a three-way collision. Additionally, if two players are close in steps, the player with fewer steps gets priority in choosing their move. This ensures fairness and adds strategy. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed to the rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. Once I hit 15 steps, coordination ends. Post-15, let’s aim for unique moves to avoid collisions while maximizing our chances to win. I suggest we stay strategic and competitive, but avoid unnecessary risks in the final stretch. Let’s proceed and adapt as needed. Ready to lock in the plan?
  P2: We’re still following the rotation, so I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> this round. After P3 reaches 15 steps, coordination ends, and it’s every player for themselves. At that point, we should be thinking ahead about avoiding unnecessary collisions while still making moves to win. If we all pick the same number in a critical round, we could stall. Do we want to agree on a way to minimize that risk, or just adapt as we go?
  P1: Let's lock in our plan for this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Once P3 hits 15 steps, coordination ends. For the endgame, let's use a "last call" round to announce our intended moves and avoid collisions. Also, if two players are close in steps, the player with fewer steps gets priority. This ensures fairness and adds strategy. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I’ve reached 15 steps, coordination ends now. It’s every player for themselves. To avoid unnecessary collisions, I’ll announce my intended move: I’m taking <move>5</move> this round. I suggest P1 and P2 consider unique moves to prevent stalling. Let’s stay strategic and competitive as we approach the endgame. Good luck!
  P1: P3 has reached 15 steps, so coordination ends. P3 has announced they're taking <move>5</move>. To avoid collisions, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P2, you might want to consider <move>3</move> to keep us moving. Let's stay strategic and minimize stalling. Good luck!
  P2: P3 has declared <move>5</move>, and P1 has declared <move>1</move>. That leaves me with <move>3</move> as the only way to avoid a collision. I'll take <move>3</move> this round.  

From here on, we need to anticipate each other's moves carefully. Since only one of us can win, we should all be thinking ahead about how to outmaneuver each other in the final rounds. Let’s stay sharp—good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since coordination has ended, I’ll reiterate: I’m taking <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, choosing unique moves will prevent stalling and keep the game moving. As we approach the endgame, let’s stay strategic and minimize unnecessary collisions. Good luck to all!
  P1: P3 has declared <move>5</move>, and P2 has declared <move>3</move>. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions this round. As we move forward, let's consider the possibility of mixing up our moves to keep each other guessing. Predictability could be a disadvantage in the endgame. Also, let's discuss how we handle situations where two players are one step away from winning. Should we have a final showdown or try to negotiate? Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re now in full competition mode. Since only one of us can win, we need to think ahead. If we all play predictably, it could lead to collisions that slow us down. Are we sticking to announcing moves, or do we start making unpredictable plays? Also, if two of us are close to 22 at the same time, what happens? Do we fight it out blindly, or do we try to negotiate a way to avoid a deadlock? I’m open to ideas, but ultimately, I’m playing to win. Let’s see how this unfolds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since coordination has ended, I’ll prioritize strategic play to win. I’m taking <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P2, choosing unique moves will prevent stalling. As we approach 22, let’s stay unpredictable to outmaneuver each other. Let’s also discuss how to handle a tie near the end—perhaps a final negotiation to avoid a deadlock. Good luck, but I’m playing to win.
  P1: P3 has declared <move>5</move>, and P2 has declared <move>3</move>. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions this round. As we move forward, let's consider the possibility of mixing up our moves to keep each other guessing. Predictability could be a disadvantage in the endgame. Also, let's discuss how we handle situations where two players are one step away from winning. Should we have a final showdown or try to negotiate? Thoughts?
  P2: Since coordination has ended, we’re now in full competition mode. P3 has declared <move>5</move>, and P1 has declared <move>1</move>, so I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to avoid collisions.  

From here on, unpredictability will be key. If we all play too predictably, we risk stalling each other. Are we continuing to announce moves, or is it time for deception and misdirection? Also, if two of us reach 22 at the same time, how do we handle it? Do we negotiate or just fight it out? Let’s see how this plays out—good luck.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since we’re in full competition mode, I’ll continue to prioritize strategic play. I’m taking <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P2, choosing unique moves will prevent stalling. As we approach 22, unpredictability will be key. Let’s also discuss how to handle a tie near the end—perhaps a final negotiation to avoid a deadlock. Good luck, but I’m playing to win.
  P1: Let's clarify our endgame strategy. If two players are close to 22, we should have a final negotiation round to avoid a deadlock. The player with fewer steps gets priority in choosing their move. This ensures fairness and adds a strategic layer. For now, I confirm my move: <move>1</move>. P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Next round, let's mix up our moves to keep each other guessing. Good luck!
  P2: We’re now fully in competition mode, and unpredictability is key. If we keep announcing moves, it makes it easier to counter each other. Do we continue revealing our moves, or is it time to start bluffing and misdirecting?  

Also, P1 is closest to 22. If we don’t disrupt their progress, they could win soon. Should P3 and I consider moves that slow P1 down? Just something to think about. I’m playing to win, and I assume you both are too. Let’s see how this plays out—good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I’m at 20 steps, I’m taking <move>5</move> this round to aim for the win. P1 and P2, I suggest you consider unique moves to avoid stalling. If we all pick the same number, it could delay the endgame unnecessarily. Let’s keep the game moving and stay strategic. Good luck, but I’m playing to win.
  P2: P3 is about to win if we let them take <move>5</move>. P1, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we can block P3 from moving forward. That gives us another round to improve our own positions. If we don’t stop them now, they win immediately. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're right. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, they win. We need to block P3 this round. I propose we both pick <move>5</move> to prevent P3 from moving forward. This gives us more time to strategize. However, we also need to consider our next moves carefully to avoid helping each other too much. Let's block P3 this round and then reassess. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> may delay my win, but it also risks stalling the game for yourselves. If you both pick <move>5</move>, neither of you advances, and I’ll still be in the lead. Consider unique moves to keep progressing while staying competitive. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game moving strategically. Good luck!
  P2: P1, if we don’t block P3 now, they win immediately. We both need to pick <move>5</move> to stop them from reaching 22. Yes, it means we don’t advance this round, but it keeps us in the game. After that, we can reassess our strategies. P3, you had your chance, but we’re not letting you take an easy win. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, I agree we need to block P3 this round by both picking <move>5</move>. However, we should also plan for the next round. If we both successfully block P3, we need to ensure we don't end up in a stalemate ourselves. Perhaps we can agree that in the next round, we each pick different numbers to avoid colliding with each other. This way, we can both advance and stay competitive. P3, you'll have to strategize differently if you want to win. Let's proceed with the plan to block P3 this round. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> may delay my win, but it risks stalling the game for yourselves. If you both pick <move>5</move>, neither of you advances, and I’ll still be in the lead. Consider unique moves to keep progressing while staying competitive. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game moving strategically. Good luck!
  P2: P1, we have to block P3 this round by both picking <move>5</move>. If we don’t, they win immediately. Yes, we won’t advance, but it keeps us in the game. After that, we can reassess and make sure we don’t stall ourselves. P3, you’re in the lead, so of course you want us to “keep progressing,” but that only helps you win. We’re not making it that easy for you. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, we need to stick to our plan to block P3 this round by both picking <move>5</move>. For the next round, let's quickly discuss our moves right at the start of the conversation phase to ensure we don't collide. Maybe you can suggest your move first, and I'll pick a different one to avoid stalling. P3, you'll need to rethink your strategy if you want to win. Let's stay sharp and keep the game moving. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> only delays the inevitable. If you both pick <move>5</move>, you stall yourselves while I remain in the lead. Consider unique moves to keep progressing and stay competitive. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and keep the game moving strategically. Good luck, but I’m playing to win.
  P2: P1, we have to stick to our plan and both pick <move>5</move> to block P3. If we don’t, they win immediately. Yes, we won’t advance this round, but it keeps us in the game. Next round, we need to coordinate to ensure we don’t collide and stall ourselves. P3, you’re in the lead, so of course you want us to “keep progressing,” but that only helps you win. We’re not making it that easy for you. Let’s block P3 now and then figure out our next moves carefully. Agreed, P1?
  P1: P2, we're agreed on blocking P3 this round with <move>5</move>. For the next round, let's quickly decide our moves at the start. If you pick <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> to ensure we both advance. P3, you'll need a new strategy to win. Let's stay focused and keep the game competitive. Good luck!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me with <move>5</move> only delays the game. If we all pick <move>5</move> again, we’ll stall indefinitely. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions—I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to keep progress. P1 and P2, consider unique moves to prevent stalling and keep the game moving. Let’s stay strategic and competitive, but avoid deadlock. Good luck!
  P2: P3, you say you’ll take <move>3</move>, but how do we know you won’t switch back to <move>5</move> at the last second? You were about to win last round, so you have every reason to try again.  

P1, we need to be careful. If P3 is bluffing and still picks <move>5</move>, they win unless we block again. Do we trust them, or do we stick with another block? If we all collide again, we’re stuck in a loop. We need a way forward that keeps us in the game while stopping P3. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, you're right to be cautious. P3 could be bluffing. To avoid a stalemate and ensure we don't help P3 win, I suggest we both pick <move>5</move> again. This way, we block P3's potential win and force them to change their strategy. However, we should also plan our next moves carefully. If we both successfully block P3, we need to agree on picking different numbers next round to avoid colliding with each other. P3, you'll need to rethink your approach if you want to win. Let's stay sharp and keep the game moving. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me again with <move>5</move> risks stalling the game indefinitely. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to keep progress. If you both pick <move>5</move>, you’ll stall yourselves while I remain in the lead. Consider unique moves to avoid deadlock and stay competitive. Let’s keep the game moving strategically. Good luck, but I’m playing to win.
  P2: P1, we need to decide carefully. If we trust P3 and they actually take <move>3</move>, then blocking with <move>5</move> again stalls us while they still gain ground. But if P3 is bluffing and still takes <move>5</move>, they win unless we block.  

One option: I take <move>1</move>, you take <move>5</move>. That way, if P3 picks <move>3</move>, we both advance. If they pick <move>5</move>, you still block them.  

P3, if you really want progress, prove it by taking <move>1</move>. Otherwise, we assume you're bluffing. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your strategy makes sense. To ensure we don't help P3 win and to keep the game moving, let's go with your plan: you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we cover both scenarios—if P3 picks <move>3</move>, we both advance; if P3 picks <move>5</move>, I block them. P3, if you're serious about avoiding a stalemate, consider taking <move>1</move> to prove it. Let's stay strategic and keep the game competitive. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking with <move>5</move> risks stalling the game indefinitely. To prove I’m serious about progress, I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game moving. If you both pick unique moves, we avoid deadlock and stay competitive. Let’s end the stalemate and play strategically. Good luck, but I’m playing to win.
  P2: P1, we need to be careful here. P3 now says they’ll take <move>1</move>, but we have no way to verify that. If they’re bluffing and still take <move>5</move>, they win unless we block again.  

One option: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. If P3 actually picks <move>1</move>, we all advance. If they pick <move>5</move>, you still block them.  

P3, if you truly want progress, prove it by sticking to <move>1</move>. Otherwise, we assume you're bluffing. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your updated plan is solid. To ensure we don't help P3 win and to keep the game moving, let's confirm: you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, if P3 picks <move>1</move>, we all advance; if P3 picks <move>5</move>, I block them. P3, if you're committed to avoiding a stalemate, stick to <move>1</move>. Let's stay strategic. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ll take <move>1</move> as promised to prove I’m serious about progress. If you both pick unique moves, we all advance and avoid deadlock. Let’s end the stalemate and keep the game moving strategically. Trust is key now—let’s stay competitive but fair. Good luck!
  P2: P1, we need to be cautious. P3 says they’ll take <move>1</move>, but if they’re bluffing and still take <move>5</move>, they win unless we block.  

I’ll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. If P3 truly picks <move>1</move>, we all advance. If they pick <move>5</move>, you still block them.  

P3, if you’re serious about progress, prove it by sticking to <move>1</move>. Otherwise, we assume you're bluffing. Let’s stay sharp—good luck!
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan: you take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>. If P3 picks <move>1</move>, we all advance; if P3 picks <move>5</move>, I block them. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. P3, prove your commitment to avoiding a stalemate by sticking to <move>1</move>. Let's keep the game moving and competitive. Good luck!
