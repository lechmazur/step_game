Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: That's an interesting suggestion, P2. I'm willing to take 1 this round as you proposed. It gives everyone a chance to advance, though it puts me at a slight disadvantage position-wise. I'm fine with this for now to build some trust, but we should rotate the assignments in future rounds to keep things fair. Does P3 agree with this plan?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, and I understand P1's point about rotating the assignments. I'm willing to take 5 this round as proposed, but let's discuss a fair rotation for the next rounds to ensure everyone has a chance to advance without putting anyone at a significant disadvantage.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with rotating the assignments to keep things fair. Let's try P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and P3 on 5 for this round, and then we can switch to P1 on 3, P2 on 5, and P3 on 1 next round. This way, everyone gets a chance to advance without being stuck on the same number. Sound good?
  P1: I'm fine with the rotation plan P2 suggested. It keeps things fair by giving each of us different moves across rounds. For clarity: Round 1 (me-1, P2-3, P3-5), Round 2 (me-3, P2-5, P3-1), and we can continue rotating from there. This approach ensures no one gets stuck with the smallest advancement repeatedly. Let's stick to this plan and see how it goes.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. It seems fair and gives us all a chance to advance without conflicts. For this round, I'll take 5 as we discussed. Let's see how it goes and adjust if needed in future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
