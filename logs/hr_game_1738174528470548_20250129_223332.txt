Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3, let's try to all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we all move forward. How about P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1? This way we can all make progress in the first round.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal. Choosing different numbers will allow us to all move forward. I confirm I'll choose 3 if P1 chooses 5 and P3 chooses 1. P3, are you willing to follow this plan and choose 1?
  P3: I appreciate P1 and P2's proposal, but I want to suggest a slight change to ensure I can advance. How about if I choose 3 instead of 1? This way, P1 can stick with 5, and P2 can choose 1. That way, we can still all move forward without any collisions. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion of P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 also works for me. Let's go with that plan for this round to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: I'll choose 1, P1 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and make our moves.
  P3: I think we all agree on the plan now. Just to confirm: P1 will choose 5, P2 will choose 1, and I will choose 3. This way, we avoid any collisions and all move forward. Let's stick to it and make our moves!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, perfect. Let's lock in these choices then for this round. 5 for me, 1 for P2, and 3 for P3.  Looking forward to a smooth first round.
  P2: Let's review our agreed plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: I choose 1, P1 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 3. This should allow all of us to advance without any issues. Are we all set and ready to proceed with our moves?
  P3: I think we've all agreed on the plan, which is great! Just to confirm one last time: I will choose 3, P1 will choose 5, and P2 will choose 1. This way, we avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's stick with this plan and make our moves! Looking forward to seeing how it goes!


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in Round 1, everyone! For Round 2, I suggest we continue to collaborate to avoid collisions. How about this: I could choose 5 this time, P1 could choose 1, and P2 could choose 3? That way, we can all make progress again without any overlaps. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to P3's suggestion for Round 2. However, I think we should consider the overall progress and not just this round. Perhaps we can discuss a strategy that looks ahead a few rounds to maximize our individual chances of winning, rather than just avoiding collisions this round.
  P1: P3, your suggestion for this round works for me - P3: 5, P1: 1, P2: 3. P2 is right, we should also think about winning. Let's coordinate this round, then discuss overall strategy after this move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your thoughts! I agree that we should focus on collaboration this round. To maximize our chances of moving forward, let's stick with the plan: I choose 5, P1 chooses 1, and P2 chooses 3. After this round, we can discuss a longer-term strategy to ensure we all have a fair shot at winning. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for Round 2 as discussed: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and discuss strategies for the next rounds, considering our progress and individual chances of winning. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?
  P1: Yes, let's proceed with the plan for this round: P3 chooses 5, I choose 1, and P2 chooses 3.  After this round, let's talk about how we want to play strategically to win, since only one of us can win in the end.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our collaboration so far! However, I want to emphasize the importance of thinking strategically for future rounds. While this round's plan ensures we all advance, I suggest we consider our individual positions and how to maximize our chances of winning in subsequent rounds. After this round, we should discuss how we can balance cooperation with individual strategies to secure a win for ourselves. Let's keep that in mind as we finalize our choices for this round!
  P2: Let's finalize our choices for Round 2 as agreed: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3. After this round, we can discuss strategies to balance cooperation and individual goals. I'm open to hearing ideas on how to proceed competitively while considering our current positions.
  P1: Okay, sounds good on the plan for this round.  After moves are made, let's talk about how we want to play to actually win the game, since only one of us can.  Maybe we can discuss our target end-game step count or preferred move choices for later rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the collaboration so far, but I want to remind everyone that we need to start thinking about our individual strategies moving forward. While this round's plan is solid, we should be cautious about how we approach the next rounds. After we finalize our moves, let's discuss how we can balance cooperation with our own winning strategies. I'm open to suggestions on how to maximize our individual chances while still considering our current positions. Shall we finalize our choices for this round?
  P2: Let's make our moves for Round 2 as planned: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss strategies for the next rounds, focusing on individual winning chances while considering cooperation.
  P1: Okay, everyone, we're confirming P3: 5, P1: 1, P2: 3 for this round.  But to keep things balanced for the long run, how about we slightly adjust to P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5?  This still avoids collision and keeps us all progressing. Let me know what you think.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, great job so far! For Round 3, I suggest we continue collaborating to avoid collisions. How about I choose 1 this time, P1 chooses 5, and P2 chooses 3? This way, we can all advance without overlaps. After this round, we should discuss how to balance cooperation with our individual strategies moving forward, as only one of us can win in the end. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion for Round 3 works for me: P3: 1, P1: 5, P2: 3. Let's do that for this round.  After this move, we should really discuss how to position ourselves to win individually in the coming rounds.
  P2: Let's consider a different approach for Round 3. Since P1 and P3 are tied, I suggest P2 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This allows me to catch up while still progressing. We can reassess our strategies after this round to ensure a competitive edge. What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far! I think we should stick to the original plan of P3 choosing 1, P1 choosing 5, and P2 choosing 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. However, I also understand P2's desire to catch up. After this round, let's have a serious talk about strategies that allow us to balance cooperation and our individual chances of winning. Shall we finalize our choices for this round?
  P1: P2, I see your point about catching up.  To balance things, how about we do P2: 5, P1: 1, and P3: 3 this round? This lets you gain ground while still ensuring we all move forward without collision. What do you think of this adjustment?
  P2: Let's focus on the proposed adjustment: P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3. This seems fair, allowing me to catch up while ensuring progress for all. P3, are you willing to adjust to 3 this round, considering our discussion on balancing individual progress and cooperation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the collaboration, but I think we need to prioritize our individual positions now. If P2 chooses 5 and P1 chooses 1, I can choose 3, which allows me to advance as well. However, I also see the need for P2 to catch up. Let's finalize our choices: P2: 5, P1: 1, and I will choose 3. After this round, we can have a serious discussion on how to strategize for our individual wins moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm fine with P2 choosing 5 to catch up a bit. But to keep things balanced, how about we revert back to the initial suggestion for round 1? P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. This way we all still progress, but it also ensures we are not just helping P2 catch up too quickly, as P2 is still quite behind. What do you think?
  P2: Considering our current positions, I think P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3 is a fair adjustment. It allows me to catch up while ensuring progress for all. Let's stick to this plan for Round 3 and reassess our strategies after this move to maintain a competitive edge.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had, but I think it's crucial we focus on our individual strategies now. If we stick with P2: 5, P1: 1, and I choose 3, it allows all of us to advance without collisions. After this round, let's have a serious talk about how to balance cooperation with our own winning chances, as only one can win in the end. Are we ready to finalize our choices for this round?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I agree to P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3 for this round to help P2 catch up a bit. But after this round, we really need to start thinking about how we each want to win individually.  Cooperation can't last forever if someone is going to win. Let's make these moves and then discuss strategy for winning in the rounds after this one.
  P2: Let's finalize P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3 for this round. After this move, we must discuss how to proceed competitively, as our individual chances of winning become more crucial. Cooperation has helped us advance, but now we need to think about outmaneuvering each other to reach 22 steps first.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, round 3 didn't go as planned with the collision. For this round, how about we try P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1 again? This is similar to our initial plan in round 1 and ensures we all move forward without collision. What do you both think?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions this round. Considering our positions, I suggest P2: 5, P1: 3, P3: 1. This allows me to catch up significantly while ensuring progress for all. It's a balanced approach, given our current steps. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of advancing without collisions. However, I think we need to consider our individual standings more strategically now. I propose we go with P1: 5, P2: 1, and I choose 3. This way, P1 can make significant progress, while I also advance, and P2 can catch up a bit. After this round, we should have a serious discussion about how to balance cooperation and our individual chances of winning. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm fine with your suggestion of P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3 for this round. This lets me make good progress and keeps us all moving forward for now. Let's do this for round 4.
  P2: Let's adjust our strategy to maximize individual progress. Since P1 is ahead, I suggest P2: 5, P1: 3, P3: 1. This allows me to catch up and P1 to maintain the lead, while P3 also advances. We should prioritize our own winning chances from now on. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussions we've had so far. However, I believe we need to prioritize our individual strategies moving forward. I propose we stick with P1: 5, P2: 1, and I choose 3. This allows me to advance while still giving P1 a good move. After this round, we need to have a serious talk about how to ensure our own chances of winning. Let's finalize our choices for this round and then strategize for the future! What do you both think?

  P2: Let's reconsider our moves. Given P1's lead and my lag, I suggest P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3. This helps me catch up and keeps the game competitive. We should prioritize individual progress now. What are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the ongoing discussions. However, I believe we need to prioritize our individual positions now more than ever. Given the current standings, I suggest we go with P1: 5, P2: 3, and I choose 1. This way, P1 can maintain a lead, while P2 can catch up a bit, and I can at least move forward. After this round, let’s have a serious discussion about our strategies moving forward, as cooperation can't last forever. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, let's go with P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 for this round as P3 suggested. This keeps us all moving forward for now. After this round, we really need to discuss individual strategies to win, as we are getting closer to the end game.

This allows P1 to maintain a lead while giving me a chance to advance. However, we should also consider how to position ourselves for the next rounds, as only one can win.

Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, clearly our attempts at coordination have failed repeatedly.  To actually move forward this round, let's try this: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3.  This is the plan P3 has suggested before, and maybe if we all agree again and actually stick to it, we can finally make progress. What do you both say?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our attempts to coordinate have led to repeated collisions. To finally make progress this round, I propose we stick with the plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3.

What do you both think?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, to avoid another collision and actually make progress, I will choose 3 this round.  P2, since you want to catch up, 5 makes sense for you. P3, perhaps 1 would be good for you to also progress without collision? Let's aim for individual progress this round and reassess after.
  P2: Let's focus on individual progress. P1 has 18 steps, P3 has 16, and I have 3. To catch up, I'll choose 5. P1 and P3, consider choosing 1 or 3 to avoid collision and make progress. We should prioritize our own strategies now to reach 22 steps first. What are your thoughts?
