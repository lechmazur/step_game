  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 this round? This way, we all advance without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P1: P2's plan sounds reasonable, but I suggest we rotate the numbers each round to keep things fair. For example, this round P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5; next round P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and so on. This way, no one gets stuck with the same number repeatedly. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate the numbers to ensure fairness. Let's follow the rotation: this round, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) will take 5. Next round, we'll rotate as suggested. This way, we can all advance smoothly without conflicts.
