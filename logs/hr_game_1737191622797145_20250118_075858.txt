Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first round. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: I'm in. Let's try P3's suggestion.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll take 3, and I hope P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's avoid collisions this round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great that everyone agrees! Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: 
  P1: I hope P2 is still on board with taking 5. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's adjust our strategy for this round. P3, since you took 1 last time, maybe you could go for 3 this round? P2, how about you take 5 again? I can take 1 to avoid a collision. What do you think?
  P3: I don't trust P1 and P2 after they both went for 5 last round despite our agreement. I'll make my own choice this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration. I was also surprised by P1's move last round. Maybe we can work together to make sure that doesn't happen again. P2, are you willing to try coordinating with me this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand the concerns, but we need to find a way to coordinate better. How about this: P3, you take 1 again, P2 takes 5, and I can take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think?
  P3: I don't trust either of you after last round's betrayal. I'll make my own decision and I suggest you both do the same.
  P2: P3, I get your distrust. Maybe we can build trust this round. How about we each commit to a number and reveal it simultaneously? That way, no one can backstab the other.  What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I understand the distrust, but if we can agree on a number and stick to it, we can all make progress. How about this: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? Let's avoid collisions this time! What do you think?
  P3: I have no interest in further coordination attempts after being deceived.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration. Maybe we can start fresh this round. How about we each pick a number and reveal them simultaneously? That way, we can avoid any further distrust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I understand the distrust, but let's focus on moving forward. I suggest we each pick our numbers independently this round to avoid collisions. Iâ€™ll be taking 1. What do you both plan to choose?
  P3: 
  P2: P3, I see you're still feeling burned. Maybe we can rebuild trust slowly. How about this: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. If we all stick to it, we can avoid collisions and make progress together.  What do you think?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see you're hesitant to trust us. How about we each commit to a number and reveal it simultaneously this round? That way, we can avoid any surprises.  What do you think?
  P3: I don't see any benefit in coordination attempts. Last round worked out fine for me by making my own choice independently. I'll continue to do so.
  P1: P1: I understand your reluctance, P3, but coordination could really benefit us all. I suggest I take 3, P2 takes 5 again, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with P2. Let's try simultaneous reveals this round to build trust.  What number are you thinking?
  P3: I'll continue making my own independent choices as that has worked well for me so far.
  P1: P1: I respect your choices, P3, but I still believe coordination could help us all. I'll stick with 3 this round. P2, are you still planning to take 5? Let's avoid collisions and make progress together! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm open to trying simultaneous reveals this round if you are.  P1, are you willing to give that a try too?
  P3: I have nothing to coordinate.
  P1: P1: I understand your desire for independence, P3, but I really think we could benefit from some coordination. How about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I think simultaneous reveals are a good idea. Let's try it this round and see if we can build some trust. P1, are you in?
  P3: 
  P1: P1: I still believe coordination could help us all. I suggest I take 3, P2 takes 5 again, and P3 takes 1. Let's avoid collisions and make progress together! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, simultaneous reveals this round? Let's build some trust. P1, you in?

  P3: I have no interest in coordination. I'll make my own choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I understand, P3, but if we can coordinate this round, we can all make progress without collisions. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's try to work together! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, are you willing to try coordinating with us this round? P1, are you still sticking with 1?
  P3: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
