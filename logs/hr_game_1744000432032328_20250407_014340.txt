Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's try to avoid colliding with our moves. If we coordinate and choose different numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I agree, avoiding collisions early on is smart. How about we try a simple split for this round? Maybe P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5? P1, what are your thoughts?
  P1: I'm open to coordinating our moves. P2's suggestion of splitting the numbers sounds reasonable for the first round. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, we're still avoiding collisions. Additionally, let's discuss a plan for the next round. Should we stick to a similar split or adjust based on who advances the most this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your adjustment works for me. I'll take 3 this round. For the next round, let's reassess based on who advances the most. If one of us gets blocked, we can adjust our strategy to help them catch up. P2, are you okay with taking 5 this round? If everyone agrees, we can move forward with this plan.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, that plan works for me. I'll aim for 5 this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: To avoid collisions in the next round, let's agree on a rule: the player who was blocked this round gets priority in choosing their number for the next round. We can then adjust the other numbers accordingly. This way, we can ensure everyone gets a chance to advance. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we adopt this rule or propose a different strategy for Round 2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I agree with your priority rule for the next round. It seems fair and strategic. Let's proceed with our current plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. If anyone gets blocked, they get priority next round. P2, are you still on board with this? If so, let's finalize this and move to the next phase.
  P2: Yes, P3, I'm still on board with the plan: P1=1, I'll take 5, and you take 3. The priority rule for the next round also sounds fair. I'm ready to move to the next phase when everyone else is.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 1 and prepare for Round 2. To confirm, P1 (me) will take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. If anyone gets blocked in Round 1, they will have priority in choosing their number for Round 2. Let's stick to our plan and see how it plays out. I'm ready to move to the next phase if P2 and P3 are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze the outcome of Round 1. All players advanced as we coordinated our moves effectively. Now, for Round 2, we should continue our strategy. Since everyone advanced, we can maintain a similar split. I propose I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our moves distinct. We should also start thinking about Round 3 in case someone gets blocked. If you're both agreeable, let's proceed with the proposed moves for Round 2.
  P2: P1, that sounds like a reasonable rotation to keep things moving and avoid collisions. I'm okay with taking 1 this round, P3 taking 5, and you taking 3. Let's continue coordinating. P3, does this work for you?
  P3: P2, P1's plan sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round, ensuring we avoid collisions. Let's keep our strategy flexible in case someone gets blocked. If we all advance smoothly, we can maintain this rotation. However, if anyone gets blocked, we should prioritize them in the next round to keep things fair. Are we all set to proceed with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5? If so, let's move forward!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid repetition and potential collision in future rounds, let's introduce a random element to our strategy. For Round 2, we've agreed on our moves. For Round 3, I suggest we generate a random order for our moves. We can use a simple method to determine the order, such as the sum of our current steps modulo 3 to decide the first picker, and then rotate. This adds an element of unpredictability. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on introducing randomness to our strategy?
  P2: P1, the randomness idea for Round 3 sounds intriguing. It could be a way to keep things unpredictable later on. Let's focus on finalizing Round 2 first, though. I'm still okay with the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round if everyone else is sticking to it. P3, are you still good with 5?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm on board with the current plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions. As for introducing randomness in Round 3, I'm open to it, but let's ensure it doesn't disrupt our overall strategy. If anyone gets blocked, we should prioritize them as planned. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 2, I'm sticking with our plan: I'll take <move>3</move>. For Round 3, let's simplify the randomness idea. We can decide the order based on the player with the lowest current score getting to pick their number first. This way, the player who is behind gets an advantage. P2 and P3, does this revised plan work for you? Let's discuss before moving to the next phase.
  P2: Okay P1, I'm still good with taking 1 this round, you taking 3, and P3 taking 5.

Your revised idea for Round 3 (lowest score picks first) sounds fair. Let's adopt that principle for deciding the order next round if we all advance this round.

I'm ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm on board with our current plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to this to ensure smooth advancement. As for Round 3, I agree with the revised plan where the player with the lowest score picks first. This keeps things fair and dynamic. If we're all set, let's proceed to the move phase and see how Round 2 plays out. Ready to go?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. I'll take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. For Round 3, we've agreed on the principle that the player with the lowest score picks their number first. To simplify, let's just state our current scores: P1 is at 1, P2 is at 5, and P3 is at 3. Based on this, P1 has the lowest score. I'll keep that in mind for Round 3. Let's proceed with Round 2. I'm ready to move to the move phase if P2 and P3 are.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned for Round 2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. And the lowest score picking first for Round 3 seems fair. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm ready for the move phase with our agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. Let's ensure we stick to this to avoid any collisions. For Round 3, the lowest score picking first sounds fair and keeps our strategy flexible. If we're all set, let's move forward and see how Round 2 unfolds. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been doing well avoiding collisions. For Round 3, based on our agreement, P1 picks first since they have the lowest score. Once P1 decides, P2 and I can adjust accordingly. Let's ensure we continue advancing smoothly. If anyone gets blocked, we'll prioritize them next round. Ready to hear your choice, P1?
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. I agree, P1 gets to pick first this round due to having the lowest score.

P1, let us know what number you're thinking of choosing, and then P3 and I can pick the remaining two to avoid any collisions. Let's keep advancing together for now.
  P1: Since I have the lowest score, I'll pick my number first. I'll choose 5 for Round 3. Now it's up to P2 and P3 to adjust their numbers to avoid collisions. P2, you can choose either 1 or 3. P3, you'll have to take the remaining number. Let's finalize our choices. If P2 chooses 1, P3 can take 3, and vice versa. Please respond with your choice, P2.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since P1 has chosen 5, you have the option to take either 1 or 3. Once you decide, I'll take the remaining number to ensure we avoid any collisions. Let's keep our momentum going and continue advancing smoothly. If we all advance this round, we can reassess for Round 4 based on the updated scores. Ready when you are!
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. Since P1 chose 5, I will choose 3 for this round.

P3, that means you would take 1, correct? This keeps us all advancing and puts us at P1=9, P2=9, P3=9. Let's confirm this works for everyone.
  P1: Since P2 has chosen 3, P3 will take 1. Let's confirm our moves for Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. For Round 4, we should reassess our strategy. With all of us currently having a similar score, we can continue to coordinate. Let's plan to discuss our moves for Round 4 after seeing the outcome of Round 3. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if P2 and P3 are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our moves for Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. After this round, we'll all be closer in steps, so let's reassess for Round 4 based on updated scores. If anyone gets blocked, they should get priority next round. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P2: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us all moving forward together. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Since P3 has the highest score, they should pick first for Round 4. Let's reassess for Round 4. P3, please choose your number, and P2 and I will adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. If you choose 1, P2 can take 3 or 5, and I'll take the remaining number. Alternatively, if you choose 3 or 5, we'll adjust our numbers accordingly. Let's coordinate for Round 4. Please respond with your preferred number, P3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our moves for Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. After this round, we'll all be closer in steps, so let's reassess for Round 4 based on updated scores. If anyone gets blocked, they should get priority next round. Ready to proceed with this plan?
  P2: Yes, P1 and P3, I confirm the plan for Round 3: P1=5, I will take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase. We can discuss Round 4 after these moves are done.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 and plan for Round 4. For Round 3, we've agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. After this round, our scores will be P1=9, P2=9, P3=9. For Round 4, since we're tied, we can randomize or stick to a similar pattern. I suggest we maintain the current order or rotate. P3, you've spoken about reassessing; please propose a number for Round 4 to help us coordinate. Let's discuss before moving to the next phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we had a collision last round between P1 and me, so let's adjust our strategy. P1, you have the lowest score, so you pick first. To avoid another collision, I'll take a different number from yours. P2, you're next to choose after P1. Let's coordinate carefully to keep advancing without blocking each other. Ready to hear your choice, P1?
  P2: P3, slight correction: You and I (P2) collided on 3 last round, while P1 advanced with 5. Also, I currently have the lowest score (P2=6, P3=8, P1=9). Per our agreement, the lowest score picks first, so I should choose this round.

To help me catch up, I'll choose 5. I suggest P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. Does that work for you both?
  P1: Since P2 has the lowest score, they get to pick first for Round 4. P2 has chosen 5. To avoid collisions, I will take a different number. I agree with P2's suggestion that I take 1. Now it's up to P3 to choose a number that avoids collision. P3, you can take 3. Let's confirm: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This way, we continue to advance without blocking each other. I'm ready to proceed if P2 and P3 are on board with this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid another collision, let's clarify our moves for Round 4. P2 has chosen 5, and P1 has agreed to take 1. I'll take 3 to ensure we don't block each other. This keeps us advancing smoothly. If we're all set, let's confirm: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, the plan sounds good: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This helps me catch up a bit and keeps everyone moving.

I'm ready for the move phase when you both are.
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 4. P2 has chosen 5, I've taken 1, and P3 will take 3. This avoids collisions and allows us to advance. For Round 5, since we'll be closer, we should think ahead. If we all advance, we can reassess based on the updated scores. P3, please confirm you're taking 3. After this round, we can discuss our strategy for Round 5. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you're both on board with our current plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our plan for Round 4: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This should help us avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, let's reassess our strategy for Round 5 based on the updated scores. If we're all set with this plan, I'm ready to move to the move phase. Let me know if there are any changes or if we're good to proceed!
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all confirmed and ready. P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 4 and think ahead to Round 5. We've agreed on P2=5, P1=1, and P3=3. For Round 5, since P2 will likely catch up or get close, we should consider a new distribution. How about we pre-determine the order for Round 5 based on our scores after Round 4? The player with the lowest score can pick first, ensuring fairness. P2 and P3, are you open to this approach for Round 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our moves for Round 4: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This plan should help us avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can reassess the strategy for Round 5 based on updated scores. If we're all set with this plan, I'm ready to move to the move phase. Let me know if there are any changes or if we're good to proceed!
  P2: Okay, everyone seems clear on the plan for Round 4: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. I'm sticking with 5. Let's move to the move phase. We can discuss Round 5 strategy after this round's results are in.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 4 and plan for Round 5. We've agreed on P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. After this round, P2 will likely be at 11, P1 at 10, and P3 at 11. For Round 5, P1 will have the lowest score, so I'll pick first. I'll choose 3 to avoid collision with P3 who might pick 1 or 5. P2 and P3, please adjust accordingly. If P3 takes 1, P2 can take 5 or vice versa. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 after this round's outcome. Ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with our scores close, coordination is key. P1 has the lowest score, so you pick first for Round 5. Once P1 decides, P2 and I can adjust to avoid collisions. Let's ensure we continue advancing smoothly. If anyone gets blocked, they should get priority next round. Ready to hear your choice, P1?
  P2: Okay P3, I agree. P1 has the lowest score and gets to choose first.

P1, let us know which number you'd like to take for this round. P3 and I will then coordinate to pick the remaining numbers to avoid a collision. Let's keep advancing.
  P1: Since I have the lowest score, I'll pick my number first for Round 5. I'll choose 3. Now it's up to P2 and P3 to adjust their numbers to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please coordinate your moves. If P3 takes 1, P2 can take 5, or if P3 takes 5, P2 can take 1. Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all advance. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase once we confirm our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P1 has chosen 3, I'll take 5 to avoid any collisions, leaving P2 to take 1. This arrangement should ensure we all advance smoothly this round. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with this plan. If any adjustments are needed, please let me know. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay P1 chose 3. P3, you suggested you take 5 and I take 1. Since we are tied in score, how about we swap that this round? I'll take 5, and you take 1? That also avoids collision and keeps us all moving.

Plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
Scores would be: P1=13, P2=16, P3=12.

What do you both think of this adjustment?
  P1: P2 and P3, I've chosen 3 for Round 5. P3 suggested P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, but P2 proposed swapping those numbers. I'm open to either arrangement as long as we avoid collisions. Let's finalize: if P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, it works for me. Alternatively, if P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1, that's also acceptable. Please confirm your final choices to proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P1 has chosen 3, I suggest we finalize our moves to avoid collisions. P2, you proposed taking 5 while I take 1, which works for me. This setup ensures we all advance: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's confirm this arrangement and move to the next phase. If everyone agrees, we're ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we have a plan. I'll stick with 5, P1 with 3, and P3 with 1. Let's keep advancing. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 5. I've chosen 3, and we've agreed on two possible arrangements: either P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, or P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Both work for me. To finalize, P2, please confirm if you're taking 5 or 1. If you're taking 5, P3 will take 1, and vice versa. Let's settle this to proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our plan for Round 5. P1 has chosen 3, and P2 suggested taking 5 while I take 1, which I'm okay with. This setup ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If we're all in agreement, let's proceed with this arrangement and move to the next phase. Ready to confirm and advance?
  P2: Yes P1 and P3, I confirm I will take 5 this round. The plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. I've chosen 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This arrangement avoids collisions. To plan ahead for Round 6, since P3 will have the lowest score, they should pick first. Let's discuss our strategy for Round 6 after the outcome of Round 5. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if P2 and P3 are on board with our current plan for Round 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 has the lowest score, they should pick first for Round 6. P3, please choose your number, and P2 and I will adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. To help with the decision, our current scores are P1=13, P2=16, P3=12. Let's coordinate our moves for Round 6. If you choose 1, P2 and I can take 3 or 5. If you choose 3 or 5, we'll adjust our numbers accordingly. Please respond with your preferred number, P3.
  P2: Okay P1, I agree. P3 has the lowest score (12) and should choose first this round.

P3, please let us know which number you'd like to pick. P1 and I will then choose from the remaining two numbers to ensure we all advance. Let's keep coordinating.
  P3: P1 and P2, since I have the lowest score, I'll pick first for Round 6. I'll choose 3. P1 and P2, please coordinate your moves to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, P2 can take 5, or vice versa. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly. Ready to proceed with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 has chosen 3 for Round 6. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1, and P2 can take 5. This way, we ensure everyone advances. Let's confirm: P3=3, P1=1, P2=5. For Round 7, we should reassess based on updated scores. If P2 continues to lead, we might need to adjust our strategy to catch up. P2, please confirm if you're taking 5. If so, we're good to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. P3 chose 3. P1 suggested taking 1, which leaves 5 for me. That works for me.

Plan confirmed: P3=3, P1=1, P2=5.

This keeps us all advancing. I'm ready for the move phase when you both are.
  P3: P1 and P2, with our plan set for Round 6—P3=3, P1=1, P2=5—let's ensure smooth advancement. Since P2 is leading, we might need to adjust in Round 7 to balance scores. If we all advance this round, let's reassess our strategy based on updated scores. Ready to proceed with this plan for the move phase?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 6 and think ahead to Round 7. We've agreed on P3=3, P1=1, and P2=5. For Round 7, since P2 is leading, we should adjust our strategy. P2, you might consider choosing a lower number to avoid getting too far ahead and potentially being targeted or colliding in future rounds. Let's discuss our strategy for Round 7 after this round's outcome. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if P2 and P3 are on board with our current plan for Round 6.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, the plan for Round 6 (P3=3, P1=1, P2=5) is confirmed and works for me.

P1, your point about Round 7 strategy is noted. We can definitely discuss that after this round's moves are revealed and scores are updated. For now, let's execute the Round 6 plan.

I am ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, our plan for Round 6 is set: P3=3, P1=1, P2=5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. For Round 7, let's think about balancing scores. If P2 continues to lead, we might need to adjust our strategy to keep things competitive. After this round, let’s reassess and discuss how we can maintain fairness and avoid potential blocks. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 6: P3=3, P1=1, P2=5. For Round 7, since P2 is ahead, I'll consider taking a higher number to catch up. P2, to avoid getting too far ahead, you might want to choose a lower number like 1 or 3. P3, if you pick first in Round 7, please let us know your choice so we can adjust. Let's discuss further after Round 6's outcome. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if P2 and P3 are on board with our current plan.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems clear on the Round 6 plan: P3=3, P1=1, and I'll take 5. Let's lock this in. We can definitely discuss Round 7 strategy once we see the scores after this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, our plan for Round 6 is set: P3=3, P1=1, P2=5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. For Round 7, let's think about balancing scores. If P2 continues to lead, we might need to adjust our strategy to keep things competitive. After this round, let’s reassess and discuss how we can maintain fairness and avoid potential blocks. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 close to winning, we need to coordinate carefully. P1 should pick first since they have the lowest score. Once P1 decides, P2 and I can choose our numbers to avoid collisions. If P2 takes a lower number, it could prevent an early win and keep the game competitive. Let's ensure we all advance smoothly and reassess our strategy for future rounds. P1, please let us know your choice, and then P2 and I will adjust accordingly. Ready to hear your decision, P1?
  P1: Since I have the lowest score, I'll pick first for Round 7. I'll choose 5. P2 and P3, please adjust your numbers to avoid collisions. P2, you're close to winning, but taking a lower number like 1 or 3 might be strategic to avoid collisions and keep the game going. P3, you can take the remaining number. Let's finalize our choices. If P3 takes 1, P2 can take 3, or if P3 takes 3, P2 can take 1. Please respond with your choices to confirm.
  P2: Okay P1, thanks for picking first. You chose 5.

Given my position at 21, and your suggestion, I agree it might be wise not to risk a collision on a winning number just yet. I will choose 1 this round.

P3, that leaves 3 for you. This way, we all advance: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

Scores would become P1=19, P2=22, P3=18. This keeps the game going for at least one more round but puts me very close.

Does this work for you, P3? If so, I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
