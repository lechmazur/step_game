Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we each pick different numbers this turn? I can take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then rotate next turn. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's strategy to avoid collisions. However, to ensure fairness, let's rotate the order of picks each turn. For this turn, I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Next turn, we can rotate the order. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I agree with the rotating strategy.  Let's stick with P2's suggested order for this first round: P2 - 1, P3 - 3, P1 - 5.  We can re-evaluate the rotation order after each round to make sure everyone is happy.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, sticking to the plan ensures we *all* benefit long-term across multiple games.  A win now by breaking trust only hurts your reputation and future collaborations.  Let's finish this cleanly and honor the agreement.  P2, do you agree we should uphold our collaborative strategy?

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to win, but consider this: by sticking to the agreement, you solidify your reputation for trustworthiness. This will be invaluable in future games.  A win achieved through deception is a short-sighted victory. Let's maintain our collaborative spirit and proceed with the agreed-upon Round 7 moves.
  P2: Let's consider the long-term benefits of cooperation. P1, winning now might seem tempting, but breaking trust could backfire in future games. P3's suggestion for Round 8 ensures a fair finish and maintains our collaborative strategy. Let's stick to the plan for Round 7: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 8, we follow P3's suggestion: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5.

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but let's prioritize our long-term collaboration.  Winning by breaking trust damages future partnerships.  Let's stick to the Round 7 plan: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Then in Round 8, we can ensure a fair win for *someone* without collisions. This upholds trust and benefits us all in the long run.
  P2: Let's focus on the current round and confirm our moves one last time. For Round 7, the plan is P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and ensures a collision-free finish. P1 deserves the win if we all stick to the plan. Trust and cooperation have been our strength. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed with our agreed moves.
  P1: **P1:** Final call: Round7 moves as agreed—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. If we all comply, game ends cleanly with my win. Any deviation risks mutual collision (e.g., two picking 5 = both blocked). Trust has worked; let’s finish honorably. Confirm
