Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions in our first moves. I suggest I take 3, while others can pick 1 and 5. What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine with avoiding collisions for this first move. Since P2 wants to take 3, I'll go with 5. That leaves 1 for P1, if they agree. This gives us all a clean start without wasting moves. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: I propose we switch roles: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. No collisions and I get a strong start. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I don't agree with P1's proposal. I made the first suggestion and P3 already agreed to it. Let's stick with the original plan - I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Changing now just creates confusion and distrust. What's your final word on this, P1?
  P3: I'll stick with our original agreement. P2 made the first suggestion, I agreed to take 5, and that leaves 1 for P1. Changing plans now does create unnecessary confusion. Besides, P1, you'll have plenty of opportunities to make larger moves in future rounds. Let's start with our agreed plan and move forward cooperatively.
  P1: I propose a fair rotation over the next three turns so we all get a big jump early:

Round 1: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1  
Round 2: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1  
Round 3: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1  

After that we can reassess. This guarantees no one hogs the lead. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll be direct - I reject P1's rotation proposal. They're trying to change agreements after P3 and I already settled on a plan. I'm sticking with my original move of 3, and I trust P3 will take 5 as agreed. P1 can either take 1 or risk a collision.
  P3: I want to be absolutely clear that I'm taking 5 this round as originally agreed with P2. P1, if you also choose 5, we'll both get 0 steps, which hurts us both and helps P2. Your proposed rotation doesn't benefit me since I already have the highest move this round. Let's stick with our first agreement: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We can discuss different arrangements for future rounds after this one.
  P1: Sounds good, I’ll take 1 as agreed. Let’s lock this in.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm currently ahead, I'll take a smaller step this round. I'd suggest P1 take 5 (moving to 6 steps) and P2 take 3 (moving to 6 steps). I'll take 1 (moving to 6 steps). This would even the playing field while avoiding collisions. What do you both think? This seems fair since I got the biggest advance last round.
  P1: I agree with P3’s plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this turn. Then in round 3, the two lower scorers can team up to catch whoever’s leading.
  P2: I don't agree with that plan. I'm already behind P3 and taking 3 again would put me further behind P1 too. I propose I take 5 this round to catch up with P3, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This keeps things balanced and gives everyone a fair chance. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2 is concerned about falling behind, but let's be fair here. My proposal evens everyone at 6 steps. P2's plan puts them ahead at 8 steps while leaving P1 behind at 4 steps. This creates imbalance and will likely lead to P1 opposing it. 

I'm standing by my original suggestion: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps things perfectly balanced going into round 3. Balance now means we can all start with equal footing next round.
  P1: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 take 1 so we all end at 6 steps. This keeps us level going into round 3.
  P2: I maintain my position - I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. If I take 3 as suggested, I risk falling behind when alliances shift next round. P1 and P3 are already coordinating about "lower scorers teaming up" next round. I won't be manipulated into a weaker position. I'm taking 5 - you two can arrange your moves accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P2 is very determined to take 5. Rather than risk a collision that benefits only P1, I'll compromise and take 3 instead of 1 this round. This puts P2 and me at 8 steps each if P2 follows through with 5, and P1 can take 1 or advance to 6 with 5. The important thing is avoiding deadlock. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions. Does this work, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’ll take 1 to avoid any collision. Let’s see how the board looks after this and then plan how to catch the leader next round.
  P2: I accept P3's compromise. I'll take 5 as stated, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This creates a balanced position between P3 and me, while P1 can catch up next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 and I are tied for the lead, while P1 is behind, I suggest a balanced approach for this round. P1 should take 5 to start catching up (reaching 7 steps), I'll take 3 (reaching 11), and P2 can take 1 (reaching 9). This maintains competition while giving everyone forward progress. P1 gets to close the gap somewhat, and neither P2 nor I pull too far ahead of each other. Thoughts?
  P2: I disagree with P3's suggestion. Since we're tied for the lead, we should both take smaller steps to avoid collision while P1 takes 5 to catch up. I propose I take 3 and P3 takes 1, putting us at 11 and 9 steps respectively. This keeps the race competitive while letting P1 advance. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, please take 3. P2, please take 1. This avoids any collision and moves us all forward. P3 and I are on the same page—P2, will you lock in 1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice P1 supports my original proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), while P2 wants the reverse for us two leaders. Since P1 is clearly taking 5, the question is whether P2 or I take 3. Let me be clear: I intend to take 3 this round as initially proposed. P2, if you also choose 3, we'll both get zero progress while P1 catches up significantly. The most strategic move is to accept my proposal rather than risk collision that leaves you falling behind.
  P2: I see I'm being pressured from both sides. While I don't like it, a collision with P3 would only help P1 catch up. Fine - I'll accept taking 1 this round to avoid mutual destruction. But be warned: if you try to box me in next round, I won't hesitate to force a collision.
  P1: I’ll take 5 as agreed. P3 you take 3, P2 you take 1. Let’s lock this in and end discussion.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I accept this agreement: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This gives us all forward progress while maintaining competitive balance. Let's proceed with these moves and evaluate the new positions next round.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, choosing 3 to collide with P3 only hurts both of you and lets me narrow the gap. We all agreed: I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1. Locking that in avoids a mutual zero. If you insist on 3, you risk falling behind. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm currently ahead, I'll propose a balanced approach. I'm willing to take just 1 step this round to maintain goodwill. For P1 and P2, I suggest one of you take 5 and the other take 3. This lets P1 catch up somewhat while P2 can either maintain position or advance significantly. Given your positions, you should decide between yourselves who takes which larger number. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's offer to take 1, but as I'm 2 steps behind them, I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. P1 can take 3 to continue catching up - this gives everyone forward progress while keeping the race close. Does this work for both of you?
  P1: I propose we level the field this round: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—putting us all at 12 steps. That way no one pulls ahead and we start round 5 on equal footing. P3 has already agreed to 1; P2, will you join this fair move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see what P1 is suggesting, but completely erasing my lead doesn't seem fair after my strategic play so far. While I'm willing to slow down, I'd prefer to take 3 instead of 1. This puts me at 14 steps while you both reach 12 - keeping things competitive but not completely resetting the game. A 2-step lead with 9 steps still needed to win keeps the game interesting for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: I understand P3's change of position, but I still need 5 to stay competitive. If I take 3 as P1 suggests, I risk falling too far behind P3. I maintain my position: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the race close while giving everyone forward progress. P1, you'll still have chances to catch up in future rounds.
  P1: I’ll take 1 to avoid any collision. P2, you take 5 to keep pace. P3, please confirm you’re taking 3 so we can lock this in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P2 takes 5 to catch up with me at 14 steps, and P1 takes 1 to move to 8 steps. This arrangement keeps the game competitive and gives everyone forward progress. I'm fine with P2 catching up to me rather than risking a collision that would only benefit P1. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I confirm the agreement: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This puts P3 and me at 14 steps each, maintaining a competitive race. Let's move forward with these moves.
  P1: I’m going to take 5 this round. P2, if you also take 5 we both collide and get 0, letting P3 grab 3 unopposed and extend their lead. Better for you to switch to 3 and stay at 12. P3, you’re fine with taking 1 or 3? Let’s avoid a collision that kills us both.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm still behind P3, I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. P1 can take 3 to continue catching up, and P3 can take 1 since they're already ahead. This gives everyone forward progress while keeping the race close. What do you both say?
  P3: I disagree with P2's proposal as it puts them ahead of me. Since I've been leading fairly, I suggest: I take 3 (to 14 steps), P1 takes 5 (to 13 steps), and P2 takes 1 (to 10 steps). This keeps me slightly ahead while letting P1 catch up significantly and preventing P2 from overtaking me. This is more balanced than having P2 suddenly jump to the lead position.
  P1: I agree with P3’s suggestion—let’s do: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This avoids any collisions, moves us all forward, and pushes P2 back to 10 while P3 goes to 14 and I go to 13.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I reject both proposals. I'm taking 5 this round - I need it to stay competitive and won't accept being pushed back to 10 steps. P1 and P3 are clearly coordinating against me. If either of you also picks 5, we'll collide and get nothing while helping the third player. P3 can take 3 and P1 can take 1 if you want to avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: I see P2 is determined to take 5. While I don't like losing my lead, a collision would hurt us both and only benefit P1. As a compromise, I'll take 3 this round (to 14 steps) if P2 takes 5 (to 14 steps) and P1 takes 1 (to 9 steps). This keeps P2 and me tied for the lead rather than one of us falling significantly behind. P2, this is a fair resolution that respects your need to advance while maintaining my competitive position.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, please confirm you’ll take 3. P2, your only safe play is 1—if you pick 3 or 5 we risk collisions that hand the lead to me or P3. Let’s move forward: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm taking 5 this round and won't back down. P1 is trying to force me into taking 1, but that would leave me far behind. P3 has offered a fair compromise where they take 3 and we end up tied at 14 steps. P1, if you also pick 5, we'll both get zero progress. Your best move is to take 1 and plan for future rounds.
  P3: I remain committed to taking 3 this round. P2 has made it clear they're taking 5. P1, taking 5 will only result in a collision with P2, benefiting neither of you while I advance alone. Your strategic move is to take 1, avoid the collision, and plan for future rounds. Let's be practical - P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 gives everyone forward progress and keeps the game competitive.
  P1: Alright, to avoid handing anyone free steps, I’ll take 1, P2 you take 5, and P3 you take 3. Any deviation risks a collision that helps the third player. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and move on.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, please take 3. P2, if you pick 3 you’ll collide with P3 and both get 0, letting me jump to 14. If you pick 5 you collide with me and P3 free-advances. Your only safe move to make progress is 1. Let’s lock in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1—no collisions and we all move forward. Anyone deviating risks handing the lead to someone else.
  P2: Since P3 and I are tied for the lead, I propose we both take smaller steps to avoid collision while P1 catches up a bit. I'll take 3 and P3 can take 1, putting us at 17 and 15 steps respectively. P1 can take 5 to reach 14 steps. This keeps the race competitive while letting P1 advance. What do you both say?
  P3: I see both of you have proposals. Since P2 and I are tied, I'm unwilling to fall behind by taking just 1 step. I'm planning to take 3 this round (reaching 17 steps). If P2 also takes 3, we'll both get nothing while P1 jumps forward 5 steps - not good for either of us. P1, you can take 5 as you proposed, and P2, I suggest you take 1 to avoid a collision that benefits only P1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 5 to reach 14. P2 and P3, only safe move for you is both picking 3: you’ll collide and stay at 14, stopping either from jumping to 17. If one of you picks 1 or 5, the other gets a free 3 to 17 and a big lead. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=3.
  P2: I reject P1's suggestion for P3 and me to collide. I'm taking 5 this round - colliding with me only helps whoever doesn't collide. P3, you should take 3 as stated, and P1 should take 1 to avoid wasting their move. This puts P3 and me at different positions (19 vs 17) while P1 reaches 10. Any other combination risks someone getting zero progress.
  P3: I reject both proposals. P2 taking 5 puts them at 19 steps - too close to winning. P1 wants P2 and me to collide, benefiting only them. Here's what makes sense: I'll take 3 (to 17), P1 takes 5 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 15). This keeps the race competitive and balanced with no one pulling too far ahead. P2, taking 1 now is better than risking a collision with me that helps only P1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, think about this: if you both pick 3 you collide and stay at 14 while I take 5 to catch up. If one of you picks 1, the other hits 17 and stays ahead. Your only safe, competitive move is P2=3 and P3=3. I’ll take 5. Ready?
  P2: I won't be manipulated into a collision with P3 that only helps P1. I'm taking 5 to reach 19 steps. P3, you've consistently played strategically - take 3 as you planned to reach 17. P1 can take 1 to reach 10. Any other moves risk someone getting zero progress while helping their opponent. Let's be practical and avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: I'm confirming I'll take 3 this round to reach 17 steps. P2 is clearly signaling they'll take 5 (to 19 steps), and taking 3 keeps me competitive without risking a collision with P2. P1, your best move is taking 1 rather than colliding with P2 at 5. A collision only wastes your move. Let's all advance: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced without anyone falling too far behind.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm close to winning at 17 steps. I propose I take 5 (reaching 22), P2 takes 1 (reaching 15), and P1 takes 3 (reaching 12). This gives everyone forward progress while maintaining competitive balance. P2, rather than trying to catch up this round, consider that with me at 22, you could block my win next round by matching my move. This strategy gives you better control than risking a collision now.
  P2: I reject P3's proposal. I'm taking 5 this round to reach 19 steps. With P3 at 17, letting them take 5 puts them too close to winning. P1 can take 3 to reach 12, and P3 should take 1 to stay at 18. This keeps the race competitive without giving anyone an insurmountable lead.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and both get 0—your safest play is 3. P3, if you choose 3 you’ll collide with P2, so take 1. This locks in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 with no collisions and everyone making progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I can see both P1 and P2 want to take 5, which would cause them to collide while I advance. Instead of everyone fighting over 5, let me propose a different approach: I'll take 3 (to 20), P1 takes 1 (to 10), and P2 takes 5 (to 19). This keeps both of you in striking distance of me while avoiding any collisions. P2 gets to close the gap significantly, and we all make forward progress. A collision between you two only benefits me.
  P2: I appreciate P3's compromise offer, but with them at 17 steps, letting them take 3 puts them too close to winning at 20. I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 to reach 19. P1 and P3 can arrange their moves between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. A three-way fight over 5 only wastes everyone's moves.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2 and P3: please both take 3 so you collide with each other and neither of you advances—P1 goes to 14, P2 stays at 14, P3 stays at 17. Next round I’ll team with P2 to block the leader. Any other choice hands someone a runaway lead. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are both insisting on taking 5, which will result in a collision where neither advances while I move forward unchallenged. This is actually the best outcome for me. I'll take 3 this round to reach 20 steps. You two can either continue your collision course, or one of you can switch to 1 or 3. Either way, I'm confirming my move as 3.
  P2: I see P3 is determined to take 3 and reach 20 steps. P1 is trying to force a collision with me at 5. Fine - I'll take 1 this round to avoid the collision. Better to stay at 15 steps than get zero progress while P3 extends their lead. P1, you can take 5, and P3 takes 3 as stated. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P3 – think twice about taking 3 to hit 20. If you do, P2 at 14 goes to 19 and can steal the win next turn while you’re one off. Instead, let’s all aim to collide P2 & you now: I take 3, P2 takes 5, you take 5. You and P2 both stall (stay at 14 & 17), I move to 12. That keeps you off 20 and the race wide open.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we must stop P3 from winning. I’ll mirror whatever P3 picks—3 or 5—to collide and stall them at 20. Will you join me? If we both match P3’s number, they get zero progress and the race stays alive. Please commit to matching P3’s move this turn.
  P2: I agree with P1 - we must stop P3 from winning. I'll also commit to matching P3's move this round, whether it's 3 or 5. P3, if you try to advance, you'll collide with both of us and get zero progress. Your only safe move is to take 1. Let's lock this in: P3 takes 1, while P1 and I match whatever larger number you attempt.
  P3: I see your blocking strategy. Since I need just 3 more steps to win, you're both threatening to match my move if I choose 3 or 5. While taking 1 this round isn't ideal, it's better than risking a collision that benefits nobody. I'll take 1 to reach 21 steps. However, consider this: whichever of you reaches 23 first wins. Can you truly trust each other not to defect when victory is so close?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 1 you go to 21. I’ll take 5 to reach 19. P2, pick 3 to reach 18—no collisions now. Next round P3 must choose 3 or 5 to hit 23+, but we both match that and stall them. Meanwhile one of us can take 5 and win. P2, will you lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn so we can block P3 next round?
  P2: I reject P1's plan. If I take 3 while they take 5, they'll be in position to win next round. I'm taking 5 to reach 20 steps. P3 is wisely taking 1, and P1 should take 3 to reach 17. This keeps us all competitive without giving P1 too much advantage. Next round we can coordinate to block P3's win while maintaining balance between us.
  P3: I'm confirming I'll take 1 this round to reach 21 steps. However, I notice both P1 and P2 want to take 5, which would result in a collision where neither advances. Perhaps you should coordinate your moves? If you collide at 5, I'll easily win next round regardless of your blocking attempts. Trust is difficult when you're both racing for second place while claiming to cooperate against me.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’ve said you’ll take 1 to reach 21—got it. P2, take 5 now (to 20) and I’ll take 3 (to 17). P3=1 →21. Next round, whatever P3 picks—3 or 5—I’ll match their 3 (blocking them) and you pick 5 (colliding if they pick 5), so they stall at 21. You then take 5 and win outright. P2, does our plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this turn work for you?
  P2: I accept P1's latest proposal. I'll take 5 to reach 20 steps while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Then next round, we can coordinate to block P3's win attempt. Let's lock in these moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round to reach 21 steps. I notice P1 keeps changing their story - first wanting to match whatever I pick, then suggesting P2 take 3, now proposing P2 take 5. P2, be careful - P1 is positioning themselves to win next round by having you block me while they make the winning move. Think about it: why is P1 so eager to direct your moves? Regardless, I'm taking 1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, please agree to mirror whatever P3 picks this turn; I’ll take 5. That way if P3 chooses 1, 3 or 5 you collide and stay at 20/21, while I leap from 17 to 22 and block P3’s win. P3, any choice you make yields zero under this plan. Let’s lock in: P1=5, P2=P3’s move.
  P3: I see P1's plan - have P2 match my move while P1 takes 5 to reach 22. P2, think about this: if you help P1 block me, next round P1 will be at 22, perfectly positioned to win while you're stuck far behind at 20. They're using you! Instead, I propose taking 5 myself to reach 26 and win. P2, if you take 3, you'll reach 23 and potentially tie with me if I take 5. This gives both of us a chance at victory rather than handing P1 the advantage.
  P2: I reject both proposals. I'm taking 5 to reach 25 and win outright. P3, if you also pick 5, we both get zero and P1 advances. If you pick 3, you'll reach 24 but I'll still win with 25. P1, you're too far behind to catch up. The race is between P3 and me now - who will blink first?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 & P3: You’re both desperate to pick 5 – it’s your only path to win. If one of you deviates to 3 or 1, the other grabs 23+ and wins outright. So you’ll both pick 5, collide, and leave me free to jump from 17 to 22. Next turn I win. Embrace the inevitable: both of you pick 5.
  P3: P2, your plan to take 5 makes sense - you'd win with 25 steps if no collision occurs. But consider this: if both of us pick 5, we collide and P1 advances to 22 while we stay put. If I pick 3 instead, reaching 24 steps, you still win with 25 while I get a respectable second place. This seems like the most rational outcome rather than a mutual collision that only benefits P1.
  P2: I accept P3's suggestion. I'll take 5 to win with 25 steps, and P3 can take 3 to reach 24 for second place. This is better than us colliding at 5 and letting P1 back into the race. P3, you're being rational - a guaranteed second place beats a collision that helps P1. Let's lock this in: P2=5, P3=3, P1 can take whatever they want.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3: I’ll take 5. If P2=5 and P3=3, P2 wins outright and P3 settles for second. P3, do you really want that? Your only way to stop P2 is to match his 5—collision stalls you both at 20/21 while I jump to 22 and threaten victory next round. P2, you’ll stick with 5 to win. P3, will you pick 5 to block him or pick 3 and hand him the game?
  P3: I won't settle for second place by taking 3. I'm taking 5 to reach 26 and win outright. P2, if you also choose 5, we both stall while P1 advances to 22. Is that what you want? By matching my 5, you guarantee neither of us wins this round, setting up P1 for an easy victory next round. Think carefully - your choice between winning yourself or helping P1 depends entirely on whether you follow through with your 5.
  P2: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 to win with 25 steps. P3, you can either take 3 for a guaranteed second place, or match my 5 and we both get nothing while P1 advances. Your choice between silver and mutual destruction. I won't back down from 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all collided at 5 last round, we're in the same position. P2 needs 3 to win, I need 2, and we've seen that matching moves leads nowhere. I propose a solution: I'll take 1 (to 22), P2 takes 3 (to 23), and P1 takes 5 (to 22). This gives P2 the win they've been fighting for, while P1 and I reach the same position. P1, will you accept this reasonable compromise?
  P2: I reject P3's proposal. I'm taking 5 to win with 25 steps. P3, you need 2 steps to win - if you pick 5 we collide and stall while P1 advances. If you pick 3, you reach 24 but I still win with 25. If you pick 1, I win outright. P1 is too far behind to matter. The win is mine this round regardless of your choice.
  P1: P2, you’re at 20 and P3 at 21. If you take 3 now, you hit 23 and win outright—P3 can’t stop you. If you go for 5, P3 will match and you risk a collision, letting me edge closer next turn. Take the guaranteed win: P2=3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 26 and win. P2, P1 is right - you only need 3 to reach 23 and win outright. Insisting on 5 is risky because I'll definitely pick 5 too, causing us both to stall at our current positions while P1 advances. Why gamble on a collision when you can guarantee your victory with 3? The choice is yours: certain victory with 3 or mutual zero with 5.
  P2: P3 is right - I'll take 3 to guarantee my win at 23 steps. No point risking a collision at 5 when victory is certain with 3. P3 can take whatever they want, but they can't stop me from winning this round. P1 is too far behind to matter. Let's end this cleanly: P2=3 for the win.
  P1: P2, if you choose 3, P3 will take 5 and win outright (21+5=26). Your only defense is to pick 5 and collide with P3, stalling them (and you). That’s far better than handing them victory. I’ll take 5 to reach 22. Next turn I can block whoever emerges. Better a collision now than a free win for P3. P2, switch to 5 and stop them.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is deliberately misleading P2. The rules state if multiple players cross 23 in the same turn, the one with highest total steps wins outright. If P2 takes 3 (reaching 23) and I take 5 (reaching 26), I win because I have more total steps, not P2. That's why P1 wants P2 to block me with 5. I'm confirming I'll take 5 this round - either to win with 26 steps or to force a collision with P2. Choose wisely, P2.
  P2: I see through P3's explanation - if we both cross 23, the highest total wins. I'm taking 5 to reach 25 and prevent P3 from getting 26. P3 will likely match my 5, causing us both to stall, but that's better than letting them win outright. P1 can advance but won't catch up. Let's collide at 5, P3.
  P1: I’m taking 5. P2 and P3, your only safe play is 5—mutual collision stalls you at 20/21 while I jump to 22. Any other move hands one of you the win. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 24 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 24 steps
