Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a strategy. I propose we all choose a different number to avoid collision and maximize progress. P1, you choose 1, P3 chooses 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward in the first round. What are your thoughts?
  P1: "P2, your plan gives P3 a 5-step lead. Let's rotate who takes 5 each round to keep it fair. I'll take 5 this turn; next, P2 or P3 can. Otherwise, P3 gains too much early advantage. We need balanced progress to prevent a runaway leader."
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's rotation idea has merit, but it may lead to complexity. How about a simpler approach: we agree on a fixed order for choosing 5, like P1 this round, me next, then P3? This maintains fairness without needing constant adjustments. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Agreed. Fixed order for 5: P1, P2, P3. This round, I'll take 5. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. Confirm to ensure no collisions. If silent, we proceed as stated.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm the agreed order to avoid confusion. This round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, I'll take 5, and so on. P3, please acknowledge to ensure we're all on the same page.
  P1: P3, confirming your move now is critical. To prevent collisions: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1 this round. Next round, 5 rotates to P2. Last chance to confirm—silence implies agreement.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As agreed, it's my turn for 5. I'll take 5 this round. P3, you should take 3 to maintain the rotation, and P1, you take 1. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. Confirm your moves to avoid any misunderstandings.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, critical to confirm you'll take 3 as agreed. If you deviate, collisions hurt us all. P2 takes 5, I take 1. Trust the rotation—next round P3 can take 5. Breaking the plan now risks mutual losses. Let's all advance smoothly. Confirm  to lock in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your silence is concerning. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, please confirm you'll take 3 as agreed. P1 and I have stated our moves according to the rotation. Your confirmation is crucial for a smooth round. Let's maintain the plan and advance together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, last chance to confirm 3. If you take 5, you and P2 collide. I’m locked on 1. P2, stay on 5. Trust the plan for mutual gain. No second chances after this.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's continued silence suggests a potential deviation from the plan. P1 and I have committed to our moves. To avoid collision, P3 must take 3. If not, I'll reconsider my move to protect my progress. P3, a simple "agree" or "disagree" would clarify your intentions.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, hold firm to 5. P3’s silence forces their own risk. If they take 5, you both lose. If they take 3, they gain. We proceed as planned. I’m locked on 1. Final warning to P3: deviating now only sabotages your own progress. Stick with 3 for mutual benefit.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given P3's consistent silence, I'll proceed with caution. P1, I'll stick to 5 as planned. If P3 deviates and takes 5, we'll both lose progress. I urge P3 to take 3 to avoid collision and maintain fairness. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our planned moves.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3: Final warning—choosing 5 collides with P2, zero gain. Taking 3 advances you. Our moves are fixed. Sabotage only hurts yourself. Proceeding as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2: To prevent mutual loss, let’s split 5 and 3. I’ll take 5; you take 3. P3 likely sticks to 1. If they take 5, only I collide—you gain. If they take 3, you collide—I gain. Either way, one advances. Confirm agreement.
  P2: P1's suggestion to split 5 and 3 is reasonable, considering the current state. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: I'll take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, I can catch up, and we maintain a balanced progression. P3, please confirm your intention to take 1 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed with a clear plan to ensure mutual progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: Alternate taking 5 between us each round. This round: I take 5, you take 3. Next round, you take 5. P3 likely stays on 1. This way, we avoid collision and balance progress. If you take 5 now, P3 might collide with you again. Trust the pattern—mutual gain. Confirm?
  P2: P1, I understand your proposal, but taking 5 this round is crucial for me to catch up. If P3 sticks to 1, I'll take 5, and you take 3. This ensures I progress significantly. P3, please confirm your move to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our strategy for this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Take 3 to guarantee your move. If P3 takes 1, you gain 3. If they take 5, I collide and you still gain. Choosing 5 risks collision again. Secure your progress with 3. I’ll take 5. P3 likely stays on 1 as before. Confirm?
  P2: P1, I'll take 5 to catch up. You take 3, and P3 likely takes 1. This ensures I progress and maintains balance. If P3 deviates, I'll still gain. I'm committed to taking 5 this round. Confirm your move to avoid collisions and ensure mutual progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2: Take 5. I'll switch to 3 to avoid collision. P3 likely takes 1 again. If they take 5, you collide but I gain. Secure your 5; I secure 3. Proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves. I'll take 5 as previously stated. P1, you'll take 3, and P3, you'll likely take 1. This ensures progress without collisions. Confirm to proceed with the move phase.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2: Learn from Round 3—taking 5 risks collision with silent P3. Secure your progress with 3; I'll take 1. P3, take 5 if you dare—collide alone. Let’s all advance: P2=3, P1=1, P3=5. No overlap, guaranteed gains. Confirm or lose again.
  P2: P1's suggestion to take 3 for guaranteed progress is tempting. However, considering P3's unpredictable behavior, I propose a cautious approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 can take 5. This minimizes collision risk and allows us to advance. P3, confirm your intention to avoid another collision. Let's proceed with a safe strategy this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2: Lock in your 1. I take 3. P3’s move determines their loss. Proceed to moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our strategy. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 can take 5. This minimizes collision risk. P3, your silence suggests unpredictability, so taking 5 might be your best move. P1, are you committed to taking 3? Confirm to proceed.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** Final lock: P2=1, me=3. P3’s choice: take 5 (safe if honest) or gamble. We proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid further collisions, let's stick to our latest agreement: I take 1, P1 takes 3. P3, taking 5 is your best option for progress. Confirming our moves will ensure a collision-free round. P1, are you still committed to taking 3? P3, please acknowledge your intention to take 5. Let's finalize our strategy and proceed with the move phase.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** Final lock: P2=1, me=3. P3’s last chance—take 5 safely or collide. Proceeding.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures progress for all. P3, taking 5 is your best move. P1, you're committed to 3. Let's finalize and proceed with the move phase to avoid further delays. Confirm your moves to lock in our strategy.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Given P3's silence and our current positions, I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This strategy maximizes progress while minimizing collision risk. P1, your lead position makes taking 5 reasonable. P3, taking 1 avoids collision and allows some progress. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure a smooth round. Confirm your intentions to lock in our moves.
  P1: **P1:** P2: Take 5 this round to leap ahead. I'll secure 3. If P3 takes 5, you both lose but I gain. If they take 1, we all advance. Balanced risk for your progress. Confirm? P3: Stick to 1 to avoid collision. Finalize moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I'll take 5 to catch up. P1, take 3 to secure progress. P3, taking 1 avoids collision. This strategy balances risk and reward. Confirm your moves to proceed with minimal collisions and maximum progress. Let's finalize our plans for this round.
  P1: **P1:** P2: Take 3 for guaranteed gain. P3's pattern shows 5 risks collision. I take 5; if they copy, you still gain 3. Secure your progress. P3: Choose 1 to avoid loss. Proceeding to moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, given our positions, I'll take 5 to catch up. P1, consider taking 1 to avoid collision with P3, who might take 3. This ensures some progress for all. P3, taking 3 risks collision with P1. Let's finalize our moves to minimize collisions and maximize progress. Confirm your intentions to proceed.
  P1: **P1:** Final lock: I take 3. P2, take 5. P3: choose 1 or collide and lose. Proceeding.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Given P3's consistent silence and our current positions, I'll take 5 to catch up. P1, consider the risk of collision if P3 takes 3. I urge P3 to take 1 to avoid another collision. Let's proceed with caution to minimize losses and maximize progress. Confirm your moves to finalize our strategy for this round.
  P1: **P1:** Final lock: P2=5, me=3. P3: choose 1 (safe) or 5 (collide with P2). Taking 3 collides with me—both lose. Secure your minimal gain. Proceeding.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P2: Take 3 this round. If you take 5, I’ll mirror and we both lose. You gain 3 now, then take 5 next. I need only 1 more step next round. Colliding now only stalls us, letting P3 advance. Secure your progress rationally. P3: Stick to 1 to avoid loss.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, given our positions, I'll consider P1's suggestion. Taking 3 now and 5 next round could be a strategic move. P3, taking 1 is still your safest option to avoid collision. P1, if you mirror my move and we collide, it indeed stalls our progress, potentially benefiting P3. Let's weigh our options carefully to maximize gains and minimize collisions. Confirm your intentions to proceed with a clear plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2: Final warning—take 3 or collide. I'm locked on 5. If you take 5, mutual loss. P3: Take 1 to secure +1. Proceeding now.
  P3: <stop>

P3, taking 1 is still your safest option. Let's proceed with this plan to minimize risk and maximize gains. Confirm your intentions to finalize our strategy for Round 8.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P2: Lock 3 now. I take 5. Next round, take 5 to reach 17. P3: 1 secures +1. Collisions only aid P3. Proceed.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take 3 as previously agreed, ensuring progress without collision. P1, you're set on 5, and P3, taking 1 is safest. Let's proceed to minimize risk and maximize gains. Confirming our moves will help avoid further delays and potential losses. I'm committed to taking 3 this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P2: Lock 3 now. Next round: you take 5, I take 1 (final step). Colliding now forfeits your chance. P3: take 1—any deviation self-sabotage. Proceeding to moves.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take 3 to avoid collision and secure progress. P1, you've stated you'll take 5. P3, taking 1 is safest. Let's proceed to minimize risk and maximize gains.

  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, given the current state, I'll take 5 to catch up. P1, consider taking 1 to secure your win next round. P3, taking 1 is safest. Let's minimize collisions. If P3 takes 5, I'll collide, but P1's lead is almost secured. Confirm your intentions to proceed with minimal risk.
  P1: **P1:** P2: Secure 5 to gain. P3: Avoid 1—collision with me means mutual loss. Choose 3/5. I take a separate path. Finalize moves to ensure no overlaps.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take 5 to catch up. P1, you're close to winning, so taking 1 might be strategic. P3, taking 3 or 5 could be beneficial, but avoid colliding with P1. Let's proceed with caution to minimize losses. Confirm your intentions to finalize our moves for Round 9.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 5 for safe progress. If you take 1, I’ll take 5, ensuring you lose. My move is separate. Secure your gain now.
