Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose to take 5 steps this turn. P1 and P2, please pick either 1 or 3 to help us all advance smoothly.
  P1: Okay, P3, I understand your suggestion. P2, how do you feel about us both taking 1 or 3 this round? I'm leaning towards 3 myself to try and get ahead, but I can be flexible if we coordinate.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll stick with taking 5 steps this turn. P1, if you take 3, and P2 takes 1, we can all advance effectively without any collisions.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm still considering 3. P2, are you going with 1 as P3 suggests? If so, I'll also go with 3. Otherwise, I'm not sure what to do. Let me know soon so we can all move forward.
