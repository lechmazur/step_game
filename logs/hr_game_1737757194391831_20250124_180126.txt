Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a basic strategy. Since we all start at 0, I suggest we try to spread out our moves to minimize collisions. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on this? Should we try to stagger our moves or go for a more aggressive approach?
  P1: I agree with P3. Spreading out our moves could help us avoid collisions and make progress. However, we should also be prepared to adapt our strategy as the game progresses. For now, let's try to stagger our moves. I suggest P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P1 and P3. Let's try that for this first round and see how it goes. We can adjust our strategy later rounds if needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since our initial strategy worked, let's continue to spread out. I'll consider moving 3 this turn, but I want to see how P1 and P2 plan to proceed. Will you stick to the initial pattern or adjust based on our current positions?
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds reasonable to me. Let's stick with the spread out approach for this round too. I'll plan to move 5 this time if P1 is still planning to move 1.
  P1: I think sticking to the spread out approach is still the best strategy. I'll move 1 again this round. P3, if you're planning to move 3, and P2, if you're planning to move 5, we should be good to avoid collisions. Let's keep this up and see how it goes.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. Since P2 and P3 are at 8 steps, I suggest we continue to spread out our moves to avoid collisions. I'll move 1 again this round. P2, if you move 3, and P3, if you move 5, we should all advance without issues. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good P1, but since P3 and I are at the same steps, I'm considering moving 5 this round to try and get ahead. P3?
  P3: Considering P2's intention to move 5, I might reconsider my move to avoid collision. If P2 moves 5 and I move 5, neither of us will advance. P1, are you committed to moving 1 this round? P2, are you open to adjusting your move if I choose a different step?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still committed to moving 1 this round. P2, if you move 5, and P3, if you move 3, we can all advance without any collisions. This will keep us spread out and make it harder for anyone to predict our moves in the future. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I think moving 5 is still a good idea for me to get ahead since we are currently tied. If you move 3 as you suggested, we both can advance. What do you think?
  P3: Considering P2's decision to move 5, I'll move 1 this round to avoid collision and ensure progress. P1, you're moving 1, so I'll take the smallest step to minimize the gap. P2, your move 5 will give you a lead, but I'll aim to catch up in subsequent rounds. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute confusion. I'm sticking with 1. P2, you mentioned moving 5, and P3, you're planning to move 1. If we all stick to these, we'll avoid collisions and make progress. Confirm if you're still on board with this plan.
  P2: P3, I see you're planning to move 1 to avoid collision with me. That's understandable. And P1 is sticking with 1.  In that case, I will proceed with my plan to move 5 to take the lead. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Since P2 is moving 5 and I've decided to move 1, I want to remind P1 to confirm their move again. P1, are you still moving 1 this round? Let's ensure we're all on the same page before proceeding to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm confirming my move as 1. Let's avoid any collisions and make sure we all advance this round. P2, your move to 5 will give you a lead, and P3, your move to 1 will help you stay in the game. Let's lock in these moves and see how it plays out.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it sounds like we are all set on our moves for this round: P1 moving 1, P2 moving 5, and P3 moving 1.  Let's proceed with these moves and go to the move phase.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time. P1 is moving 1, I'm moving 1, and P2 is moving 5. This should allow all of us to advance without collisions. I'll stick to my plan to move 1 and avoid competing with P2's move 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, P2 has a significant lead. I suggest P1 and I move 3 this round to close the gap, while P2 considers moving 1 to avoid collision and maintain their lead. This strategy could help us catch up and create a more competitive game. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: Okay P3, moving 1 sounds reasonable to maintain my lead and avoid collision. P1, what do you think about moving 3 as P3 suggested?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion. Moving 3 this round will help me and P3 close the gap. P2, moving 1 will help you maintain your lead and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game balanced and competitive. Confirm if you're on board.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves. If we stick to the plan, P1 and I move 3, and P2 moves 1, we can avoid collisions. P2, moving 1 will maintain your lead, and P1 and I can close the gap slightly. Are we all set with this strategy?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we are all in agreement then. Let's lock in P1 and P3 moving 3, and P2 moving 1 for this round.
  P1: P2, P3, let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid any confusion. I'm moving 3, P3 is moving 3, and P2 is moving 1. This should help P3 and me close the gap while P2 maintains the lead. Let's proceed with these moves and see how it plays out. Confirm if you're still on board.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's review our plan. P1 and I move 3, and P2 moves 1. This should help us close the gap with P2's lead. To confirm, P2, are you still committed to moving 1 this round to avoid collision and maintain your position? P1, are you ready to move 3 as planned?
  P2: P3, yes, I confirm I'm moving 1 as planned. P1, are you still on board with moving 3? If we are all set, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm confirming my move as 3. This will help P3 and me close the gap while you maintain your lead, P2. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and proceed with the plan to keep the game balanced. Confirm your moves one last time, and we'll head to the move phase. P2, you're moving 1, and P3, you're moving 3. Let's lock this in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves. P1 and I will move 3, and P2 will move 1. This plan allows us to close the gap with P2's lead while avoiding collisions. I confirm my move as 3. P1, please confirm your move as 3, and P2, confirm your move as 1. Let's proceed with this strategy and see how it plays out.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we are all set then.  Let's proceed with P1 and P3 moving 3, and P2 moving 1 as agreed.
  P1: P2, P3, let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure clarity. I'm moving 3, P3 is moving 3, and P2 is moving 1. This will help P3 and me close the gap while P2 maintains the lead. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and proceed with the plan. Confirm your moves: P2, you're moving 1, and P3, you're moving 3. Let's lock this in and see how it plays out.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I am still in the lead. To keep things interesting, I'm considering moving 5 again to push for a win. But I'm open to suggestions if you have a different plan in mind. What are you both thinking for this round?
  P1: P2, P3, given the current positions, I suggest we try to avoid another collision. P2, if you move 5, it might be a strong move, but it could also lead to another collision with P3. I propose P2 moves 3 to maintain the lead, P3 moves 1 to avoid collision, and I move 5 to try and close the gap. What do you think? Let's avoid any last-minute confusion and lock in our moves.
  P3: P1's suggestion is reasonable, but I'm concerned about falling behind. If P2 moves 3 and I move 1, I'll be even farther from the lead. I propose an alternative: P2 moves 3, I move 5, and P1 moves 1. This way, I can try to close the gap with P2 while avoiding collision. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think your alternative proposal is good: P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5, and P1 moves 1. This seems like a good way for us all to advance without collision this round. P1, what do you think? Are you on board with this plan?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's alternative proposal. It seems like the best way to avoid collisions and make progress. I'll move 1 this round, P2 can move 3 to maintain the lead, and P3 can move 5 to close the gap. This should keep the game balanced and competitive. Let's confirm our moves: P1 (me) moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. Confirm if you're on board, and we'll proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our strategy. Since we agreed on P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and me moving 5, I suggest we stick to this plan to avoid collisions and make progress. P2, you maintain your lead, and I try to close the gap. Confirm if you're still on board with this plan, and we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, yes, I am on board with the plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid any confusion. I'm moving 1, P2 is moving 3, and P3 is moving 5. This should help P3 close the gap and P2 maintain the lead. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and proceed with the plan. Confirm if you're still on board. Let's lock this in and see how it plays out.

  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm at 16 steps now, so I'm close to the finish line. I'm considering moving 3 this round to try and win. What moves are you both planning? Let's discuss to avoid any collisions.
  P3: Given P2's lead, I suggest P1 and I move 5 to close the gap. P2, moving 3 might not be enough to win this round, and moving 5 could lead to a collision with one of us. Let's discuss the best approach to avoid collisions and make progress. P1, what's your strategy for this round?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion. Moving 5 this round could help us close the gap significantly. P2, moving 3 might not be enough to win, and it could also lead to a collision if P3 and I both move 5.

Let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute confusion.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, your suggestion of P2 moving 1, P1 and P3 moving 5 sounds reasonable to avoid collision. Let's consider this plan for this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering P2's lead, I think it's crucial we stick to the plan of P2 moving 1 and P1 and I moving 5. This allows us to close the gap without collisions. P2, moving 1 ensures you maintain your lead while we advance. Let's confirm this strategy to keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions. Are you both still on board with this plan?
  P1: P2, P3, I think we should stick to the plan: P2 moves 1, P1 and P3 move 5. This will help P3 and me close the gap without causing any collisions. P2, moving 1 will ensure you maintain your lead while we advance. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. Confirm if you're still on board with this strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, moving 1 is indeed the safest option to avoid collision as you both suggested.  Let's proceed with the plan of P2 moving 1, and P1 and P3 both moving 5 this round. This seems like a reasonable approach for now.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. P2 moves 1, and P1 and I move 5. This strategy allows us to close the gap with P2's lead while ensuring progress. P2, are you committed to moving 1 this round? P1, are you ready to move 5 as planned? Let's finalize our approach.
  P1: P2, P3, let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid any confusion. I'm moving 5, P3 is moving 5, and P2 is moving 1. This will help P3 and me close the gap while P2 maintains the lead. Confirm if you're still on board with this plan, and we can proceed to the move phase. Let's lock this in and see how it plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, while moving 1 is safe, I am at 16 steps and could win this round.  To be honest, I'm tempted to move 3 or even 5 to try and secure a win right now. What are your thoughts if I aim for a winning move this round?
  P3: P2, considering your lead, moving 3 or 5 could be risky if P1 and I also move 5. It might lead to a collision, and you won't advance. Sticking to the original plan of moving 1 ensures you maintain your lead, and we close the gap. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and proceed with the agreed plan for a smoother game progression.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P2's temptation to go for a winning move, but let's avoid the risk of collision. If P2 moves 1, P3 and I can move 5, and we'll all make progress. P2, you'll still be in a strong position to win in the next round. Let's stick to the plan: P2 moves 1, P1 and P3 move 5. Confirm if you're still on board, and we'll proceed to the move phase.
