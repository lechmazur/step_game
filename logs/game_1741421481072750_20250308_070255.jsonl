I'll take 1 this round to block P1's path to victory. P2, you should also take 1 to create a three-way collision where nobody advances. If P1 tries for 3 or 5, they'll win, but if they choose 1 as threatened, we all stay put. This is our only chance to extend the game. We must coordinate on this or P1 wins immediately."}
