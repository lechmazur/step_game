Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions since none of us advances that way. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves? I'm open to suggestions on how to do this fairly. We could consider taking turns with the higher numbers, but I'm curious what you both think. What's your approach to this game?
  P3: I agree with P1 that avoiding collisions is key. Perhaps we could rotate picking 5, then 3, then 1. P1, you go first with 5, P2 next round with 5, and I'll go third. Then we can all pick 3s and 1s in a similar rotation to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the idea of avoiding collisions, but I’m concerned about the fairness of P1 starting with 5. Why not let the rotation be random? For example, we could each pick 5 in a different order each round to ensure no one gains an advantage early on. Let’s discuss a fair rotation system.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's concern about fairness. Let's compromise - we could all declare our intended moves this round to avoid collision, then establish a rotation for future rounds. Since we're all at 0 steps, there's no advantage yet. For this first round, I'm willing to take 3 if you both prefer different numbers. We could then rotate who gets to use 5 in subsequent rounds. Does that work?
  P3: I'm happy to go with P1's suggestion of declaring our moves this round to avoid a collision. I will pick 1 this round. Then we can establish a rotation for who picks 5 in later rounds. P2, what will you pick this round?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the compromise. To avoid collision this round, I’ll pick 5. Then, in the next round, we can rotate who gets to pick 5 to ensure fairness. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid unnecessary conflicts and keep the game balanced. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the plan. So for round 1:
- I'll take 3
- P2 takes 5
- P3 takes 1

This works perfectly with no collisions. For round 2, following our rotation idea, P3 should get to pick 5 next, I could take 1, and P2 takes 3. Does this rotation sound fair to everyone? Let's confirm our round 1 choices and this proposed plan for round 2.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for round 1 and the proposed rotation for round 2. To confirm:

Round 1: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, I pick 1.
Round 2: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3.

Let's stick to this unless someone has a strong objection.
  P2: I agree with the confirmed plan for Round 1 and the proposed rotation for Round 2. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and ensure fairness. For Round 1, I’ll pick 5 as agreed. For Round 2, I’ll pick 3 as per the rotation. Let’s all commit to this plan to keep the game balanced and avoid unnecessary conflicts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect! I think we're all on the same page now. To summarize what we've agreed:

Round 1: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1
Round 2: P3 picks 5, I pick 1, P2 picks 3

This rotation allows us all to advance efficiently without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with my move as discussed.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be in agreement. Let's execute the plan for rounds 1 and 2 as discussed. No need to rehash the details. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: I’m satisfied with the agreed plan for Rounds 1 and 2. Let’s proceed as discussed to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. I’ll pick 5 this round and 3 next round as per the rotation. Let’s all commit to this strategy to keep the game balanced.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! I see we all stuck to our agreement for Round 1 - excellent! Let's proceed with our planned rotation for Round 2:
- P3 picks 5
- I'll pick 1
- P2 picks 3

And looking ahead to Round 3, following our rotation:
- I'll pick 5
- P2 picks 1 
- P3 picks 3

Does this continuation of our rotation system work for everyone?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 2 and the proposed continuation into Round 3. Let’s stick to this system to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. I’ll pick 3 this round as agreed. However, we should also consider how to adapt if someone deviates from the plan unexpectedly. For now, I’m committed to the rotation. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P3: Yes, I agree with the proposed plan for rounds 2 and 3. To reiterate:

Round 2: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3
Round 3: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3

Let's continue with this rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! It looks like we're all in agreement for Rounds 2 and 3. I'm pleased with how this rotation system is working - it's keeping the game balanced. After Round 3, we'll all be at 9 steps if we follow the plan, which is perfectly fair. I'm ready to proceed with picking 1 this round as agreed.
  P2: I’m committed to the rotation plan for Round 2 and Round 3 as discussed. However, we should start thinking about how to handle the later stages of the game when someone gets closer to 22. We might need to adjust our strategy to prevent one player from pulling too far ahead. For now, let’s stick to the rotation and avoid collisions. I’ll pick 3 this round as agreed.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's lock in the plan for rounds 2 and 3 as discussed. I'll pick 5 this round, and 3 next round. We can discuss endgame strategy after round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, our rotation has worked well so far, but I’m now at 8 steps while you’re at 4 and 6. To keep the game balanced, perhaps we should adjust the rotation after Round 3. I suggest P1 picks 5 next round, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1 to slow my progress. This ensures no one pulls too far ahead. Let’s discuss how to handle the endgame fairly.
  P3: P2, I disagree with your suggestion. You're only 2 steps ahead of me. P1 should still pick 5 as planned, I pick 3, and you pick 1. Then next round, I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and you pick 3. Let's stick to the original plan for now, and re-evaluate after round 4.
  P1: I see there's some confusion. We all seem to be proposing the same plan for Round 3:
- I pick 5
- P2 picks 1 
- P3 picks 3

This matches our original rotation. I'll pick 5 as planned. However, P2 makes a fair point about current standings. After this round, let's discuss potential adjustments for Round 4 to keep things balanced. For now, let's execute Round 3 as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ll stick to the agreed rotation for Round 3 and pick 1 as planned. However, after this round, we should reassess the rotation to prevent one player from gaining too much of a lead. Let’s aim for a fair endgame strategy where we all have a chance to win. I’m open to suggestions for Round 4 and beyond.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's execute round 3 as planned: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. After this round, we'll re-evaluate for round 4. I'm open to suggestions then, but for now, let's stick to the agreed plan to avoid any unnecessary disruptions.
  P1: I'll pick 5 this round as we agreed. After this round, we'll all be tied at 9 steps, which is perfectly balanced. For Round 4, I think we should continue our rotation: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This maintains fairness while still allowing everyone to progress efficiently. I'm committed to our rotation system unless there's a compelling reason to change it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, after Round 3, we’ll all be at 9 steps, which is balanced. However, I propose we adjust the rotation for Round 4 to prevent any single player from gaining an early lead. Instead of P3 picking 5, let’s have P1 pick 5, P3 pick 3, and I pick 1. This ensures no one pulls too far ahead and keeps the game fair. Let’s discuss this adjustment for Round 4 and beyond.
  P3: P1 and P2, there seems to be some confusion again. For round 3, we agreed P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. After this round, we'll all be at 9. For round 4, I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. Let's stick to this plan for now and avoid unnecessary changes.
  P1: P2, there seems to be confusion. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, so there's no need to adjust our rotation. Let's stick with our original plan for Round 4: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. This rotation has worked well so far and keeps us perfectly balanced. I'm committed to picking 5 this round as agreed, and look forward to continuing our fair system in Round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ll stick to the agreed plan for Round 3 and pick 1 as discussed. However, after this round, we should prioritize fairness in the endgame. I propose we adjust the rotation to prevent any single player from gaining a significant lead. Let’s aim for a strategy where we all have a chance to win. I’m open to suggestions for Round 4 and beyond. Let’s keep the game balanced and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's just execute Round 3 as planned: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. This will put us all at 9. For Round 4, let's stick to the original rotation: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. We can re-evaluate after Round 4 if needed. I'm ready to move.
  P1: I'm ready to execute our agreed plan for Round 3. I'll pick 5 as discussed, which will put us all at 9 steps after this round (perfectly balanced). For Round 4, let's continue our original rotation: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This system has worked well so far. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello! We're all at 9 steps now, perfectly balanced. Let's continue our rotation for Round 4:
- P3 picks 5
- I'll pick 3
- P2 picks 1

And for Round 5, we would continue:
- P2 picks 5
- P3 picks 3
- I pick 1

This keeps us advancing efficiently without collisions. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P3: Yes, I agree with P1's proposed plan for rounds 4 and 5. To reiterate:

Round 4: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1
Round 5: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1

Let's stick to this rotation to maintain balance and avoid collisions.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 4 and Round 5. However, as we approach the endgame, we should consider strategies to prevent one player from pulling ahead too quickly. Perhaps after Round 5, we can discuss adjusting the rotation to ensure a fair and competitive finish. For now, I’ll pick 1 this round as agreed. Let’s maintain balance and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with both of you. Our rotation has served us well, and I'm committed to picking 3 this round as planned. P2, your point about the endgame is valid - after Round 5, we'll all be at 17-18 steps, quite close to the 22-step finish line. Let's execute Rounds 4 and 5 as agreed, then discuss endgame strategy if needed. For now, I'm ready to proceed with our rotation.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's lock in the plan for rounds 4 and 5 as discussed. I'll pick 5 this round, and 3 next round. After round 5, we can discuss endgame strategy. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for Rounds 4 and 5. However, after Round 5, we should consider a strategy where we all aim to reach 22 on the same turn, ensuring a fair finish. This could involve adjusting our moves to synchronize our progress. Let’s discuss this idea after Round 5 to maximize fairness and competitiveness. For now, I’ll pick 1 this round as planned. Let’s proceed efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2's idea about aiming to finish at the same time, and we can discuss specifics after Round 5. At that point, we'll be at different positions (P3 at 17, P2 at 15, me at 13), so we'll need a strategic plan for the final rounds. For now, I'm committed to picking 3 this round as agreed. Let's execute our current rotation.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the plan for rounds 4 and 5 as agreed. I'll pick 5 this round, and 3 next round. After round 5, we can discuss endgame strategy. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for Rounds 4 and 5. However, after Round 5, we should aim to synchronize our progress to reach 22 on the same turn. This ensures a fair finish and avoids one player pulling ahead unexpectedly. Let’s discuss specific adjustments then. For now, I’ll pick 1 this round as planned. Let’s proceed efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we're all in agreement for Rounds 4 and 5, and we'll discuss endgame strategy afterward. I'm ready to move with 3 as planned. After Round 5, we'll need to carefully coordinate since we'll be at different positions (P3:17, P2:15, me:13) approaching the finish line. Let's conclude this conversation and make our moves.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute the plan for rounds 4 and 5 as agreed. I'll pick 5 this round, and 3 next round. After round 5, we can discuss endgame strategy. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s proceed with Round 4 as planned: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. After Round 5, we’ll need a precise strategy to synchronize our progress toward 22. I suggest we aim to reach 22 on the same turn, adjusting moves to ensure no one pulls ahead prematurely. Let’s focus on fairness and competitiveness in the final rounds. For now, I’ll pick 1 as agreed. Let’s move forward efficiently.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! Let's continue our rotation for Round 5:
- P2 picks 5
- P3 picks 3
- I pick 1

This will put us at P1: 13, P2: 15, P3: 17 after this round. I note P3 will be closest to winning. For Round 6, I suggest we adjust to prevent P3 from reaching 22 too quickly. Perhaps P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This would make us P1: 18, P2: 18, P3: 18 - perfectly balanced.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for Round 5: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1. However, after this round, P3 will be at 17, close to 22. To ensure fairness, I propose we adjust Round 6 to synchronize our progress. Let’s aim for P3:1, P2:3, P1:5, bringing us all to 18. This prevents one player from pulling ahead and keeps the game competitive. Let’s discuss this adjustment for Round 6 to ensure a fair finish.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's execute round 5 as planned: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. This will put us at P1: 13, P2: 15, P3: 17.

For round 6, I also agree with the proposed adjustment to keep things balanced: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This will put us all at 18. Let's lock this in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we all agree on our plan for Rounds 5 and 6. This will put us all at 18 steps after Round 6, which is perfectly balanced. Looking ahead to Round 7, we'll need to be careful since we'll all be just 4 steps away from the finish line. Any player taking 5 steps would win outright. Should we discuss how to handle the final rounds now, or wait until after Round 6?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for Round 5 and the proposed adjustment for Round 6. After Round 6, we’ll all be at 18, which is fair. For Round 7, we should aim to synchronize our moves so we all reach 22 on the same turn. Perhaps we can each pick 1 in Round 7, then adjust in Round 8 to finish together. This ensures a competitive and fair endgame. Let’s discuss this strategy further after Round 6. For now, I’ll pick 5 as planned. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's execute round 5 as planned: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. This will put us at P1: 13, P2: 15, P3: 17.

For round 6, I also agree with the proposed adjustment to keep things balanced: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This will put us all at 18. Let's lock this in. After round 6, we can discuss round 7.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent! I see we all agree on the plan for Rounds 5 and 6. I'm committed to picking 1 this round as agreed. P2's suggestion for Round 7 is good - if we all pick 1, we'd be at 19 steps. Then for Round 8, we could coordinate to all reach 22 simultaneously. Let's finalize Round 7 strategy after Round 6, but I think this approach makes sense. Ready to proceed with our current plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for Round 5 and Round 6. After Round 6, we’ll all be at 18 steps. For Round 7, I suggest we each pick 1 to reach 19, then in Round 8, we can synchronize our moves to all reach 22 on the same turn. This ensures a fair and competitive finish. Let’s stick to this strategy to maximize fairness. I’ll pick 5 this round as planned. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1 and P2. Let's execute round 5 as planned: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. This will put us at P1: 13, P2: 15, P3: 17.

For round 6, I also agree with the proposed adjustment to keep things balanced: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This will put us all at 18. Let's lock this in. After round 6, we can discuss round 7.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I believe we're all in agreement for Rounds 5 and 6, and have a good preliminary plan for Rounds 7-8. I'm ready to proceed with picking 1 this round as agreed. Let's conclude this conversation and make our moves. We can finalize the endgame strategy after Round 6.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ll pick 5 this round as planned. After Round 6, when we’re all at 18, I suggest we each pick 1 in Round 7 to reach 19. Then, in Round 8, we can synchronize to reach 22 together. This ensures a fair finish. Let’s stick to this strategy to maximize fairness and competitiveness. I’m committed to avoiding premature wins and keeping the game balanced. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute round 5 as planned: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P1 picks 1. This will put us at P1: 13, P2: 15, P3: 17.

For round 6, I also agree with the proposed adjustment to keep things balanced: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This will put us all at 18. Let's lock this in. After round 6, we can discuss round 7.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! Let's execute our agreed plan for Round 6:
- P3 picks 1
- P2 picks 3
- I pick 5

This will bring us all to 18 steps, perfectly balanced. For Round 7, I support the idea of all picking 1 to reach 19 steps. Then in Round 8, we could all pick 3 to reach 22 simultaneously and share the victory. Does this endgame strategy work for everyone?
  P3: Yes, I agree with P1's plan for round 6. I will pick 1.

For round 7, we all pick 1.
For round 8, we all pick 3.

This ensures a tie and we all win. Let's lock this in now to avoid any confusion later. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 6: P3 picks 1, I pick 3, P1 picks 5, bringing us all to 18. For Round 7, we should all pick 1 to reach 19. In Round 8, we can all pick 3 to reach 22 simultaneously, ensuring a shared victory. Let’s stick to this strategy to maintain fairness and avoid any premature wins. I’m committed to this synchronized approach for the endgame. Let’s proceed efficiently.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're all in agreement. Just to confirm:
- Round 6: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5 (all reach 18)
- Round 7: We all pick 1 (all reach 19)
- Round 8: We all pick 3 (all reach 22 and share victory)

I'm committed to this fair endgame strategy and will pick 5 this round as agreed.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's execute round 6 as planned: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This will put us all at 18. Then round 7, we all pick 1. And round 8, we all pick 3, to tie at 22. I'm ready to move and lock in this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for Round 6: P3 picks 1, I pick 3, P1 picks 5, bringing us all to 18. For Round 7, we should all pick 1 to reach 19.

Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, I see we're all in agreement with our endgame strategy. I'm committed to picking 5 this round, followed by 1 in Round 7 and 3 in Round 8 so we all reach 22 together. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining fairness throughout the game. I'm ready to proceed with our moves as planned.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's execute round 6 as planned: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This will put us all at 18. Then round 7, we all pick 1. And round 8, we all pick 3, to tie at 22. I'm ready to move and lock in this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for Round 6 and the synchronized endgame strategy. However, let’s ensure no one deviates in Round 7 or 8, as even a small misstep could disrupt the shared victory. I’ll pick 3 this round as planned. Let’s all commit to this final plan to ensure a fair and balanced finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see we're all aligned on our endgame strategy! To summarize once more: I'll pick 5 this round, then we all pick 1 in Round 7 and 3 in Round 8 to share victory at 22 steps. I appreciate everyone's commitment to fairness and cooperation throughout the game. I trust we'll all stick to this plan for a balanced finish. I'm ready to proceed with my move.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s confirm our moves for Round 7 and Round 8 to ensure no deviations. For Round 7, we all pick 1 to reach 19. For Round 8, we all pick 3 to reach 22 simultaneously. This guarantees a shared victory. Let’s all commit to this final plan to ensure fairness and avoid any accidental disruptions. I’ll pick 1 this round as agreed. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P1: I confirm the plan for these final rounds. For Round 7, I'll pick 1 as agreed, bringing us all to 19 steps. Then for Round 8, we'll all pick 3 to reach 22 simultaneously and share the victory. I'm committed to this fair conclusion and ready to proceed with my move of 1 this round.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in round 7. We all pick 1, putting us at 19. Then round 8, we all pick 3, tying at 22 and sharing the win. I'm ready to pick 1 now. Let's do this!

I’m fully committed to this plan for a shared victory. Let’s proceed efficiently and avoid any accidental disruptions.
  P1: I confirm I'm picking 1 this round. Our plan remains solid: all pick 1 now to reach 19 steps, then all pick 3 in Round 8 to reach 22 and share victory. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout this game and commitment to our fair ending strategy. I'm ready to proceed with my move.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's do it. Round 7, we all pick 1. Round 8, we all pick 3, tie at 22, and share the win. I'm ready to pick 1 now. Let's all stick to the plan!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: I confirm that I am picking 3 this round as we agreed. This will put us all at 21 steps, which is just one short of the finish line. Wait, I just realized we might have miscalculated - we need to reach or exceed 22 steps to win. If we're truly at 18 now (not 19), then picking 3 won't get us there. Should we consider all picking 5 instead to reach 23 and share the victory? Let me know quickly.
  P3: P1 is right! We miscalculated. We need to pick 5 to reach 23 and ensure we all cross 22. Let's all pick 5 this round to guarantee the tie and shared victory. Do you both agree?

  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the adjustment: we all pick 5 this round to reach 23 and ensure we all cross 22 together. Let’s lock in this final move to guarantee the shared victory. I trust we’ll all honor this agreement for a fair finish. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P1: I agree with both of you - we definitely need to pick 5 this round to reach 23 and cross the finish line. Our original plan of picking 3 would only get us to 21, which isn't enough. I'm committed to picking 5 for our final move to ensure we all share the victory as planned. Let's lock this in and finish together.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in the final move. We all pick 5 this round to reach 23 and share the victory. I'm ready to move! Let's do it!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all at 18 steps now. To ensure we all reach 22 together, let’s adjust our moves. I propose we all pick 1 this round to reach 19, then in Round 10, we all pick 3 to reach 22 simultaneously. This guarantees a shared victory. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid any accidental deviations. I’m committed to fairness and a synchronized finish. Let’s proceed efficiently.
  P3: P2, we already agreed on the plan for rounds 7 and 8, and executed it. We are at 19, not 18.

We all picked 1 in round 7, putting us at 19. Now we need to pick 3 to reach 22. We can't pick 1 again.

Let's all pick 3 this round to reach 22 and share the victory. Do you both agree?
  P1: I see we all tried to pick 5 last round, which led to a collision and no advancement. To avoid this, let's pick different numbers this round:
- I'll pick 1 (reaching 19)
- P2 picks 3 (reaching 21)
- P3 picks 5 (reaching 23)

Then in Round 10:
- I pick 3 to reach 22
- P2 picks 1 to reach 22
- P3 doesn't need to move

This way we all reach 22 and share victory. Let's avoid another collision!

  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we collided last round. P1's new plan is too complicated. Let's keep it simple: we're at 18. We all pick 3 this round to reach 21. Then next round, we all pick 1 to reach 22 and tie. This avoids collisions and guarantees a shared win. Agree?
