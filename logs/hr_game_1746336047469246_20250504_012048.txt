Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2. Let's try to avoid collisions on the first turn so we all get started. How about we each pick a different number? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Does that sound good?
  P1: Deal. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. Next round we rotate (I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1), then rotate again (I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3) and keep cycling. That keeps things fair and collision-free. Everyone okay with that?
  P2: P2: Interesting plan, but following this rotation exactly will result in P3 reaching 23 steps first (by Round 7). Let’s instead coordinate fresh each round to avoid predictable outcomes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are correct that the rotation plan P1 suggested would benefit me in the long run. Thank you for pointing that out.

For this current turn (Round 1), my initial suggestion was P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to avoid collisions. P1 agreed. Does P2 agree to this plan for Round 1?

We can discuss the strategy for future rounds after we complete this one.
  P1: P2, I respect your concern. For this first round let’s just lock: P1 = 1, P3 = 5. You choose—3 keeps us collision-free but leaves you 2 steps behind P3; 5 matches his speed but risks a crash with him. I’ll stick with 1 either way. We can rethink everything next round once we see how this plays out.
  P2: P2: I'll take 3 for Round 1. Let's execute this safely and negotiate fresh moves each turn to prevent predictable advantages. No trust in long-term rotations.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we have an agreement for Round 1: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I will take 5.

Let's proceed with this plan for the move phase.
  P1: All right, I’m locking in 1 for this round as agreed. Let’s see how the first moves land, then renegotiate.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll play 3 as agreed. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s adjust our moves this round to balance progress. I’ll take 5 to close the gap, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances while preventing future collisions. P3, you’ll get a larger step next round if we rotate roles—fair deal?
  P1: Sounds fair. I’ll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Keeps everyone moving and avoids collisions. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the proposal for a collision-free round. However, taking only 1 step puts me significantly behind. Could we adjust slightly? How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5 as proposed, and I take 3? This still gives P2 the large gain and keeps us all moving safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Confirmed. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Let’s proceed with these moves for Round 2."
  P1: Hold on, the “balance” logic means the furthest‐behind player should get the biggest step, the leader the smallest. Right now P3 leads (5), P2’s middle (3), I’m last (1). Fair, collision-free proposal for Round 2:

• P1 takes 5  
• P2 takes 3  
• P3 takes 1  

That keeps everyone moving and narrows gaps instead of stretching them. Agree?
  P3: P1, I understand your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) aims to balance positions by having the leader take the smallest step. However, taking only 1 step would mean I lose my lead and end up tied for last place. That is not a favourable outcome for me, so I cannot accept it.

P2 confirmed agreement to my previous suggestion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This is a safe, collision-free option that allows P2 a large gain. P1, are you willing to take 1 this round so we can proceed with this plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round to close the gap. If P1 sticks to 1 and P3 takes 3, we all advance safely without collisions. This balances progress while keeping the race competitive. Let’s finalize this plan—no need for further debate.
  P1: P2, taking 5 only works if P3 really sticks to 3. If P3 decides last-minute to match you at 5, you both stall and P3 keeps the edge next turn. Safer for you to grab 3. 

P3, if you’re worried about losing the lead, take 5 and stay ahead instead of settling for 3. I’ll stay at 1 this round, so I won’t collide with either of you. 

Make your own choices, but be sure they’re collision-proof.
  P3: Okay, P1, I hear you confirming you will take 1 this round. Your suggestion for P2 to take 3 and me to take 5 creates a collision-free round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5).

P2, does taking 3 work for you this round? This would allow P1 and me to take 1 and 5 respectively without collisions, based on P1's message.

If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I will take 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal for this round only: assign steps by current rank to keep things tight and collision-free.

• Leader (P3 at 5) takes 1  
• Middle (P1 at 4) takes 3  
• Last (P2 at 3) takes 5  

Everyone advances, gaps shrink, no one risks a stall. We can renegotiate again next turn. Agree?
  P3: P1, I see your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Taking only 1 step would make me lose my lead and fall behind P1 and P2. This is not a good outcome for me.

Let's try the Round 1 plan again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This is collision-free and helps me maintain my lead. P2, does this work for you?
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll take 3 again this round, assuming P1 sticks to 1 and P3 takes 5. Let’s execute this safely and reassess with clearer standings next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let’s keep it simple and collision-free:

• P3 takes 5  
• P2 takes 3  
• I’ll take 1  

That preserves your lead, P3, and keeps everyone moving. If we all confirm, we can stop talking and get to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we have agreement on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round. This is a safe, collision-free plan that works for me.

I will take 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Ready to lock moves.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all set for P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Confirmed again: 3 this round. Let’s keep it consistent and safe. P3 stays at 5, P1 at 1. No collisions, everyone progresses. We’ll reassess after seeing the updated standings.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: That was a frustrating round! Despite agreeing on 1, 3, 5, we all picked 5 and got nowhere. Let's learn from that.

For this round, I propose we go back to the safe, collision-free plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures everyone advances and avoids repeating last round's mistake. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Last round showed that duplicating 5 just freezes us. Simple, collision-proof plan:

• P3 keeps 5 (maintains lead)  
• I take 3  
• P2 takes 1 – still progress, and next turn we swap so you’re not stuck with the smallest step twice.

Three unique numbers, everyone moves. Good?
  P2: P2: Confirmed: P2 takes 3 this round. P1, if you stick to 1 and P3 takes 5, we all advance safely. Let’s avoid collisions by locking these roles. No need for further debate—this balances progress and keeps the race fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, thanks for confirming you will take 3.

I will take 5 this round. P1, are you willing to take 1?

This plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures no collisions like last round and lets us all advance safely. Let's agree on this to move forward.
  P1: P2, with P3 on 5 and you on 3, you’ll still trail him by 7 next turn. Matching his 5 keeps you in the race—worst case you both stall, best case you draw even. I’m sticking to 1, so only you two risk a collision. 

P3, if you really want guaranteed progress, slide to 3 while P2 takes 5; you’d still lead either way.

I’m locked at 1 regardless.
  P2: P2: Confirmed again: I’ll take **3** this round. P1, if you stick to **1** and P3 takes **5**, we all advance safely. Let’s stop testing luck with duplicates—Round 3’s chaos proved that. No one gains if we stall. Lock your choices now: 1, 3, 5. No deviations.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 has confirmed taking 1, and P2 has confirmed taking 3 assuming I take 5.

I will take 5 this round. This confirms the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan which is collision-free and allows everyone to advance safely after last round's stall.

Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P1: One step won’t keep me in the race, so I’m very likely choosing 5 this turn. P3: if you also stick to 5 we both stall and hand P2 a free 3-step gain. Shift to 3 or 1 if you want guaranteed progress. P2, you can keep 3 (collision-free if P3 moves) or jump to 5 if he vacates it. Your calls—I’ve warned you.
  P2: P2: Locked on 3. P1, taking 1 ensures you don’t crash with P3’s 5. If you both chase 5, I gain ground. Your risk.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2 is leading now (6 steps), P1 is last (4 steps), and I am in the middle (5 steps).

Both P1 and P2 have incentives to take a large step like 5 this round – P1 to catch up, and P2 to extend the lead. I predict there's a high chance P1 and P2 might both target 5 again.

To avoid another stall like last round and guarantee my own progress, I will take 3 this round. P1 and P2, you can decide how to manage the 5s. I am committing to 3.
  P1: P2, you’re in front—no need to gamble. Let’s keep this clean:  
• P1 takes 5  
• P3 sticks to 3 (as stated)  
• P2 takes 1  

Everyone advances, you maintain the lead, and no one stalls. If you chase 5, I may match you again and we both freeze while P3 gains. Your move.
  P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1, if you take 5 too, we stall and hand P3 the lead. P3’s already committed to 3—safe for everyone. Your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I hear P1 proposing 5 and P2 locking 5. As I stated earlier, I am taking 3 this round to guarantee my progress.

P1 and P2, if you both choose 5, you will collide and stall, giving me a free step forward. Please be aware of this risk when making your final decision.

My move is 3.
  P1: Fine, P2: if you insist on 5, I’m matching 5. P3’s on 3, so two of us will stall while he walks ahead. Your quickest path is to slide to 1; you’d still lead P3 by two after this turn. I’m set.
  P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1, if you chase 5 again, we both stall and gift P3 the lead. P3’s taking 3 anyway—safe for him. Your move: collide or let me advance. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2 seem focused on 5. As I stated, I am taking 3 this round to guarantee my progress and avoid the collision you two are risking.

If you both pick 5, you will stall, and I will take the lead by moving to 8 steps. My move is 3. Let's proceed.
  P1: P2, last chance: I am absolutely taking 5. If you insist on 5 we both stall and P3 passes you. Shift to 1 (totally safe) or even 3 and keep your lead. Stay on 5 and you get zero again. Your move.
  P2: "P1, both of us on 5 hands P3 the lead next round. I’ll drop to 1 to keep ahead of him if you commit to 3 instead. P3’s 3 stays fixed—safe path for all. Final offer."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take the middle step (3) this round. P2 and P3, sort out who wants the 5 and who’s willing to settle for 1 so we avoid another crash. If you both chase 5, you stall and I widen the gap—you’ve been warned.
  P3: Okay, P1, I see your proposal to take 3. That leaves 1 and 5 for P2 and me.

To ensure we all advance and avoid collisions, how about this: P1 takes 3 (as you suggested), P2 takes 1, and I take 5?

This is collision-free and allows both P1 and me to make good progress, while P2 still moves forward. P2, does taking 1 work for you this round?
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll take 1 as proposed. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5—safe, collision-free progress for all. Let’s lock this plan and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed: I’m on 3. With P2 on 1 and P3 on 5 we all move safely—no collisions, no surprises. Ready to lock and move.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we have clear agreement for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I will take 5. This is a safe plan that allows everyone to advance.

I am ready to move to the move phase with this plan.
  P2: P2: Confirmed again: P2 takes 1. With P1=3 and P3=5, all safe. Let’s lock moves and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 3. If P2 sticks to 1 and P3 to 5, we all advance safely. Ready to end chat and move.
  P3: Okay, we have a clear agreement: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This plan is safe and allows everyone to advance this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: P2=1. P1=3 and P3=5 keep us collision-free. Let’s lock and move—no last-minute changes.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 is leading at 9, P2 and I are tied at 8. Last round's collision on 5 didn't help anyone except P2.

To ensure we all advance this round and avoid another stall, I propose the safe plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5.

This is collision-free and allows me to catch up to P1 while P2 also makes progress. Does this plan work for P1 and P2 this round?
  P2: P2: P2: Locked on 5 this round. P1, if you stick to 1 and P3 takes 3, I advance cleanly to 13. If you both chase 5, we stall and waste turns. P3, taking 3 keeps you ahead of P1. Final offer: 1/5/3—agree and move.
  P1: P3, P2 is fixed on 5. If you drop to 3, you’re still behind me and hand him a clear lead at 13. If you match his 5 you block his progress—both of you stay at 8 while I take 3 to 12. That keeps the race tight and denies him the jump. I’m on 3 either way; your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 is stating they will take 3, and P2 is stating they are locked on 5.

Given P1 is taking 3 and P2 is taking 5, if I take 3, I collide with P1. If I take 5, I collide with P2.

The only collision-free move for me this round is 1. I will take 1 to ensure I advance.
  P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1, stick to 3 and P3 take 1. Three unique numbers, everyone advances. If you both chase 5 again, you collide and hand me the lead at 13. P3, taking 1 keeps you ahead of P1. Final offer: 3/5/1—agree and move.
  P1: P3, you can stop P2’s jump. Match his 5, you both stall at 8; I advance to 12 on 3, keeping the field tight (9-12 spread). If you settle for 1, you’ll trail him by 5 next turn. Your choice—block or fall behind.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see your point about blocking P2, but colliding risks another stall. Given P1 is taking 3 and P2 is taking 5, my safest move to guarantee progress is 1. This aligns with the 3/5/1 plan that seems to have emerged. I will take 1 this round. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to ensure we all advance.
  P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1’s 3 and P3’s 1 keep us collision-free. If either of you chases 5, you stall while I jump to 13. Final chance to secure safe progress—stick to the plan or risk handing me the race.
  P1: P3, final thought: let’s keep the race open. If you settle for 1, P2 leaps to 13 and you’re four behind him next turn (13-9-12). But if you duplicate his 5, he stalls at 8, you stay 8, and I advance to 12—much tighter (12-9-8) with P2 in last. Blocking costs you nothing yet stops his breakout. I’m on 3 either way. Your call.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is leading at 12 steps, and P2 and I are tied at 8. We need to make progress to catch up.

To avoid another stall like last round, I propose a safe move for myself: I will take 3 this round.

P1 and P2, please coordinate on who takes 1 and who takes 5 so we ensure a collision-free round and everyone moves forward. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1, if you take 1 and P3 sticks to 3, we all advance safely. If you chase 5 again, we collide and hand P3 free progress. P3, your 3 is safe either way. Final call: 1/5/3—agree and move.
  P1: P3, pick 5 again and stall P2—costs you nothing but keeps him from leaping ahead. I’ll take 3, so only P2 gets blocked. Worst case: scores stay 12-8-8; best case: I reach 15, you 8, P2 8. Your call. P2, stick on 5 if you like, but be ready to collide.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 is stating they will take 3, and P2 is locked on 5.

This setup makes 3 unsafe for me (collision with P1). My safe options are 1 or 5. Taking 1 puts me far behind both of you. Taking 5 means I collide with P2, stalling both of us. While I stall, this prevents P2 from jumping ahead of me.

I will take 5 this round. Let's proceed.
  P2: P2: Locked on 1. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5—safe progress for all. If either of you chases 5 again, you stall while I advance to 9. Final offer: 3/1/5—agree and move.
  P1: P2, 1 leaves you at 9 while I reach 15. If you switch to 5, you either tie P3 at 13 (if he drops to 3) or block him by stalling (if he keeps 5). Either way you don’t lose ground to me and you stop him jumping ahead. I’m on 3 regardless. Your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 is stating 3, and P2 is now stating 1. I previously said I would take 5.

This plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is collision-free and allows everyone to advance safely.

This works for me. I will take 5 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: P2 takes 1 this round. P1=3, P3=5—safe, collision-free progress. Let’s lock this plan and move. No last-minute changes.
  P1: P2, taking 1 leaves you 6-7 steps behind both leaders. Grabbing 5 is strictly better:  

• If P3 sticks to 5, you block him and stay tied with him at 8—still closer to me than after a lone 1.  
• If he swaps to 3, you jump to 13 and match him, closing the gap.  

You never end up worse than the “safe” 1, and you might gain four extra steps. Why hand P3 a free ride? I’m on 3 either way—your call.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "P1, P3 – to keep moving safely, I’ll take 5 this round. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, we all advance without collision. Let’s avoid repeating past mistakes. Finalize your choices accordingly."
  P1: P3, taking 3 leaves you four behind me while handing P2 a free 5-step jump. If you match his 5, you block him completely and stay just two behind me—no downside for you. I’m content with 1 this turn; the choice is yours.
  P3: Okay, P2, I see your proposal for P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. This plan allows everyone to advance safely.

P1, taking 3 would put me at 16 steps, tying your score if you take 1. This is a much better outcome for me than stalling at 13 by colliding with P2.

I will take 3 this round, assuming P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5 as proposed by P2. This is a safe, collision-free plan that helps me catch up.

P1 and P2, can you confirm these moves?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1’s 1 and P3’s 3 keep us collision-free. If either of you shifts to 5, we stall and hand the other a free step. P3, your 3 ties you with P1—no gain for him. P1, your 1 keeps you at 16. Final call: 1/5/3—agree and move.
  P1: P3, walk through the math: if you take 3 while P2 grabs 5, scores become 16-16-14. You gain nothing on me and hand P2 +4.  

Block him instead—match his 5. Both of you stall at 13/9 while I step to 16 on my 1. You’re still just 3 behind me and P2 falls hopelessly back. Zero downside for you, huge upside versus P2.  

Your call, but duplicating his 5 is clearly the stronger play.
  P3: P1, taking 5 to collide with P2 would stall me at 13 steps while you advance to 16. That's not a good outcome for me.

The plan for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is collision-free and lets me reach 16, tying your score. This plan works best for me and allows everyone to advance safely.

I am sticking to taking 3 this round as part of the P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 plan. Let's proceed with this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P2: Locked on 5. P1’s 1 and P3’s 3 keep us collision-free. If either of you shifts to 5, we stall and hand the other a free step. P3, your 3 ties you with P1—no gain for him. P1, your 1 keeps you at 16. Final call: 1/5/3—agree and move.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m on 1. Ready to end chat and move.
  P3: Okay, P1 has confirmed 1, P2 has confirmed 5, and I have confirmed 3.

The plan for this round is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This is collision-free and allows everyone to advance safely.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, same deal: if you grab 5, I will mirror 5 and we both freeze at 15-14 while P3 jumps to 16. Your smarter play is 1—still keeps you alive without gifting P3 the lead.  

P3, take 3 and you move safely to 16, one behind me. I’ll take 5 as long as P2 stays off it; otherwise I crash it with him.  

Plan: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1. Collision-free and everybody advances. Your move.
  P3: P1, I see your proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1). Taking 3 puts me at 16 while you reach 20, letting you win next turn. That doesn't work for me.

I need to take 5 to have a chance. I will take 5 this round.

P1 and P2, if you also take 5, we collide. P1, taking 1 or 3 avoids colliding with me. Choose wisely to avoid stalling.
  P2: P2: Locked on 3. P1, take 1 to ensure safe progress for both of us. P3’s 5 stalls him if you avoid duplicating it. Let’s deny him free steps and keep the race tight. Final offer: 1/3/5—lock and move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Both of you hear this: if anyone else picks 5, so will I—no one gets a free 5-step jump.  
P2, you said you’re on 3; stick to it.  
P3, your options:  
• Take 5 ⇒ we both stall.  
• Take 3 ⇒ likely collide with P2.  
• Take 1 ⇒ you trail even more.  

Your call.
  P3: Okay, P2 is locked on 3. I have stated I will take 5.

P1, you have threatened to take 5 if anyone else does. If you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, then you and I will collide and stall at 15 and 13 steps respectively, while P2 advances to 17 steps and takes the lead.

This outcome (P1=15, P2=17, P3=13) is bad for both you and me, and only benefits P2.

My move is 5. P1, choose your move wisely to avoid a stall that only helps P2. Let's proceed.
  P2: P2: Confirmed again: I'm taking 3. P1, avoid 5 to keep moving—P3’s 5 stalls him *only* if you don’t duplicate it. Lock 1 or 3, and we all advance. Chase 5, and you gift me the lead at 17 while you freeze. Final call: 1/3/5—decide wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, last chance: if you insist on 3, I’ll match 3 and we both stall, gifting P3 the solo jump to 18.  
Shift to 1 and we all move: P3 → 18, me → 18, you → 15. You stay within striking distance instead of freezing at 14.  
I’m taking 3 (unless you block it). Decide now—1 keeps you alive, 3 guarantees you zero.
  P3: Okay, P2 is confirmed on 3, and P1 is threatening to take 3 if P2 does. This suggests P1 and P2 are heading for a collision on 3.

As I stated, I am taking 5 this round. This move is safe for me if P1 and P2 collide on 3, allowing me to advance and take the lead.

My move is 5. Let's proceed.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll take 1 this round. P1, avoid duplicating my 1 so we both advance safely. P3’s 5 only stalls if either of you mirrors it. Final plan: 1/1/5? No—P1, shift to 3 and we all move. Lock your choices now—no more delays.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and I are tied at 18, just 5 steps from victory. P2 is further back at 15.

I am taking 5 this round to win the game.

P1, if you also take 5, we both stall at 18, letting P2 potentially advance to 20 steps. To prevent this and ensure one of us wins this turn, please take 1 or 3.

P2, you can take 1 or 3 safely this round.

My move is 5. Let's proceed.
  P1: P3, if you stay on 5 I’ll mirror 5— we both freeze at 18 and invite P2 to close the gap. Your smarter play is 3 (gets you to 21) or 1; but a lone 5 will never be yours uncontested.  

P2, a 5 only guarantees you stall at 15 if either leader mirrors it. Take 3: you move to 18 and are one crash away from the lead.  

I’m reacting to your choices, not handing anyone a free win. Decide wisely.
  P2: P2: P2: Locked on 3. P1 and P3’s 5s collide, leaving me to advance to 18. No need to gamble—your rivalry stalls, I progress. Final confirmation: 3 for me, 5s for you both. Let’s end this phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your position regarding my taking 5. P2 is confirmed on 3.

Taking 5 is the best move for me to prevent you from winning this turn. If you choose to mirror my 5, we will both stall at 18, allowing P2 to catch up to 18.

This result (18-18-18) keeps me in the game. My move is 5.
  P1: P2, rethink: your “safe” 3 only drags you to 18 while P3 could win next turn.  
Switch to 5 now, collide with his 5, freeze him at 18. I’ll take 3 to 21 and keep the game alive; you lose nothing (still 15) and stay one crash away from the leaders instead of watching P3 sprint to 23.  

Summary this round:  
P3 = 5, P2 = 5 (stall them), P1 = 3 (to 21).  
Next turn we coordinate to give you a clear 5-step jump. Deal?
  P2: P2: "P1, I’ll take 5 to block P3’s push. If you take 3, you advance cleanly to 21 while P3 stalls. This keeps you ahead and limits his shot at victory. Final plan: 3/5/5—lock and move."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 is taking 3 and P2 is taking 5. My previously stated move of 5 would collide with P2, and taking 3 would collide with P1.

To ensure I make progress this round and avoid stalling, my only safe move is 1. I will take 1 this round.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, I’m staying on 3.  
If you copy 3 we both stall and P3 pulls ahead.  
Take 5 if you must, but remember I can mirror 5 next turn and freeze us both again.  
A quiet 1 now gets you to 16 and keeps you one clean 5 behind the leaders with no risk of collision.  
Your move—I’m locked.
  P2: P2: Locked on 5. P3’s 5 collides with me, stalling both of us. P1, take 3 to advance cleanly to 21. Finalize your moves—no last-minute changes.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m staying off the “3” minefield this turn—locking 1 (22).  
P3 basically has to fire the 5 if he wants any chance.  
P2, 3 only drags you to 18 and still last; 5 either rockets you to 20 (if P3 blinks) or blocks his win if he also takes 5. A quiet 1 puts you at 16 without risk.  

Bottom line: keep clear of 3, let’s finally get a clean round.
  P2: P2: "P3, you need 5 to win—but I’ll match it and stall us both, handing P1 the crown at 22. Take 3 instead, and we both move. I’ll take 1 to stay clear. Final offer—don’t throw this round."
  P3: P1 stated 1, P2 suggested 1 or 5. My move is 5 to win (18+5=23).
If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 1 or 3, I win this turn.
P2, taking 5 collides with my 5, stalling us both and letting P1 win. Please take 1 or 3.
P1, taking 3 wins for you. Taking 1 lets me win if P2 cooperates.
My move is 5. P1, take 1. P2, take 1 or 3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: If you take 3, P3’s lone 5 hits 23 and we both lose. Your only safe block is matching his 5— yes, you stall this turn, but so does he, and I only crawl to 22 on my 1. Next round you’re still just 6 - 7 behind the leaders, not out. Sit on 5 and keep the game alive.
  P2: P2: "P3, I’ll take 5 to block your push to 23. P1, take 1 to advance safely to 22. If you match my 5, we stall, and P1 wins next turn. Your move—choose wisely to keep the game alive."
  P3: P1 is taking 1 and P2 is locked on 5. My move is 5 to win.

P2, if you take 5 and I take 5, we both stall at 15 and 18 steps. P1 advances to 22 and wins next turn. Taking 5 only helps P1.

If you take 1 or 3, I win this turn, but you still advance and keep the game alive for another turn. Don't help P1 win. My move is 5.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, keep your 5 to block P3’s win. I’m sticking with 1, happy to race another round. P3, your lone 5 isn’t getting through today. Ready to move.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 to block P3's win. P1 advances safely to 22 on 1. If P3 insists on 5, we collide and stall—game continues. No last-minute shifts. Let's lock moves and see who cracks."
  P3: Okay, P1 is stating 1, P2 is locked on 5. My move of 5 is blocked by P2, which only results in P1 winning next turn while P2 and I stall.

To prevent P1 from winning next turn, I must take 1 to collide with P1. This keeps the game alive, even if I fall behind P2 temporarily.

My move is 1 this round. Let's proceed.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
