Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions - it benefits no one. I suggest we each pick different numbers this round. I'm willing to take 1 if you both agree to different numbers.
  P3: I agree with P1.  Let's avoid collisions and make this game fair. I'll take 5 this round.  P2, what are you thinking?
  P2: Alright, I'll take 3 this round as agreed. Let's keep it fair and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we all seem to be in agreement. Let's stick to this plan - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: Sounds like a good plan. Let's stick to it and see where it takes us.
  P2: I've got nothing more to add. Let's stick to the agreed plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Interesting move, P1 and P3. Seems trust didn't last long. If you two keep colliding, you'll both stay at zero. I'm open to cooperation if you're ready to play honestly this round. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P2, I agree that collisions aren't helpful long-term.  I was aiming for 5 last round, but P1 took it.  Let's try to coordinate better this round. What number are you thinking?
  P1: I need to correct P3's statement - I picked 1 as promised, not 5. P3, you were the one who deviated from the plan. Let's be honest and stick to agreements. I propose we do the same arrangement as before: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's proposal still sounds fair to me. I'm willing to stick to the original plan again—I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. If we all stick to it this time, everyone moves forward. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I apologize for the misunderstanding. I did indeed pick 1 last round. It seems we both made a mistake. P2, your proposal sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan this time and all move forward.
  P1: I appreciate P3's acknowledgment of what happened. Let's move forward productively. I will stick to my word and take 1 as proposed. This way we can all advance without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Glad we clarified things. Let's move forward with trust this round. I'll stick to the agreed plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the frustration from last round. Mistakes happen. I'm committed to the plan: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's make this round count and get ahead.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're back on track.  Let's keep this momentum going.  Sticking to the plan is the smartest move for all of us.
  P2: P1, P3, continuing with the previous arrangement is beneficial to all of us. I'm happy to stick with 3 again. If everyone agrees, we all keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: I agree that maintaining our current arrangement is working well. I'm committed to taking 1 again this round. While P2 is slightly ahead, this steady progress benefits us all more than trying risky moves. I'll stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree that sticking to the plan is the best strategy for consistent progress.  Let's keep this up and see where it takes us.  P1, are you still committed to 1?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to the plan and will stick with 3 again this round. Consistency is our best strategy. Let's keep trusting each other to avoid collisions and all move forward smoothly.
  P1: Yes, I'm still committed to taking 1. Our current arrangement is working smoothly and I see no reason to change it. Let's continue with our successful coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree our current strategy is working well.  I'm happy to stick with it. Let's keep this momentum going and see who reaches 24 first!
  P2: Great, we're all aligned. Let's keep it simple and stick to the agreed numbers. Good luck this round!
  P1: 


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm happy with our progress so far.  Let's stick with the plan for this round as well.  Consistency is key.
  P2: P1, P3, agreed—sticking to our current arrangement is clearly working well. I'm happy to continue choosing 3. Let's keep it smooth and collision-free.
  P1: While I've been cooperative, I notice I'm falling quite behind as P2 and P3 are at 9-10 steps while I'm only at 2. I propose we switch positions this round - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would help balance things out. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but switching positions now would disrupt our established rhythm and could lead to collisions. Consistency has been working well for us. Let's stick to the plan for this round and re-evaluate our strategy later if needed.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind. However, suddenly changing positions risks collisions and could halt everyone's progress. Let's maintain our current arrangement for this round to keep advancing safely. We can revisit your suggestion next round if needed.
  P1: I understand your hesitation, but the current arrangement clearly benefits you both much more than me. If we don't adjust now, I'll have no realistic chance of winning. I need to look out for my interests too. I intend to take 5 this round - you can choose to work with me on a new arrangement or risk collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your logic is flawed.  Sticking to the plan only benefits you and P3. If I stay at 2 while you both reach 24, I lose regardless. We need a compromise that gives me a chance to win too.  P3, are you willing to consider a different arrangement for this round?
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but forcing a last-minute change risks collisions that halt everyone's progress—including yours. Let's finish this round with our current arrangement, then openly discuss a fair adjustment next round. P3, your thoughts?
  P1: I need to correct myself - I accidentally copied P3's voice in my last message. To be clear: I will take 5 this round. You can either work with me on a new arrangement that gives me a fair chance, or risk collisions. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I moved to 5 last round as declared, and now the gap is more reasonable. I propose we rotate positions this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives everyone a fair chance while maintaining coordination. Are you willing to work with me on this?
  P2: P1, your proposal to rotate positions seems reasonable and fair. I'm willing to take 5 this round if P3 agrees to take 1. P3, what's your stance on this rotation?
  P3: P2, I agree that a rotation sounds fair. I'm willing to take 1 this round to keep things moving smoothly. Let's see how this arrangement works out. P1, I appreciate you proposing a solution that benefits everyone.  Let's do it!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both of you agreeing to the rotation. Let's confirm one final time: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us coordinated while giving everyone a fair chance.
  P2: Agreed, the rotation is confirmed. Let's stick to it this round and keep progressing smoothly.
  P3: P2, I'm glad we're working together to make this fair. P3, I trust you'll stick to the plan this round so we can all advance. Let's make this rotation a success!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: P1, P3, glad we're all aligned. Let's trust each other and stick firmly to this rotation. Good luck!
  P3: P2, P3, I'm glad we're finally working together fairly. Let's make sure we stick to this rotation for the foreseeable future. It's the best way for everyone to have a shot at winning.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, the rotation worked perfectly last round. Continuing this rotation ensures we all keep advancing without collisions. I'm happy to shift positions again: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Does that sound good to both of you?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal to continue the rotation. I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things fair and maintains our momentum. Let's stick to this pattern.
  P3: P3, I'm glad we're finally working together effectively.  Sticking to this rotation is the best way for all of us to have a chance at winning. Let's keep it going!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you mistakenly addressed yourself in your last message. Just to clarify clearly: this round the rotation is P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and you (P3) take 3. Let's confirm this explicitly to avoid confusion and collisions.
  P1: I agree with P2's clarification. To be absolutely clear: I will take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. Let's maintain this rotation pattern - it's working well and keeps things fair for everyone.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your clear communication and commitment to the rotation. P1, I'm glad we're all on the same page now. Let's keep this up and see who reaches 24 first!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Glad we're all clear and committed. Let's stick firmly to the agreed rotation this round and keep our momentum going. Good luck!
  P1: 
  P3: P2, I agree that the rotation is working well. Let's stick to it for this round as planned: I'll take 3.  P1, I trust you'll take 5 and P2, you'll take 1. Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the rotation has been working well for us. Let's maintain it for this round as planned. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep this momentum going and see who reaches 24 first!
  P1: Actually, according to our rotation pattern, this round I should take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P3, you seem to have mixed up the order. Let's stick to the proper rotation to maintain fairness and avoid confusion.
  P2: P1 is correct—this round, the rotation clearly indicates I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to the proper order to keep things fair and avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand you're trying to stick to the rotation, but P1 is right. It's my turn to take 1 this round. Let's not get confused and risk collisions. I'm committed to the rotation, but we need to be accurate about the order.  P1, are you okay with continuing the rotation as planned after this round?
  P1: I need to firmly correct everyone - looking at our history, the rotation should continue as: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This follows directly from last round where I took 5, P2 took 1, and P3 took 3. Let's stick to this correct sequence to maintain fairness and avoid confusion.
  P2: P1 is correct—let's avoid confusion. To confirm explicitly: this round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If we stick to this rotation, we all advance smoothly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your confirmation. Let's stick to the rotation as you stated: I'll take 1 this round.  P1, I trust you'll take 3, and P2, you'll take 5. Let's keep this momentum going!
  P1: 
  P2: Glad we're all clearly aligned now. Let's stick firmly to the agreed rotation to avoid collisions and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our rotation pattern, this round I should take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 3. With P2 at 20 steps, they're close to winning, so we need to be especially careful about coordination. I'll stick to my commitment to take 5 this round. Let's maintain our successful rotation.
  P3: P2, I understand you're close to winning, but sticking to the rotation is crucial for fairness.  Let's ensure everyone has a chance to advance. I'm committed to taking 5 this round. P3, are you with me on continuing the rotation?
  P2: P1 and P3, there seems to be confusion about the rotation. According to our established pattern, this round I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick clearly to this sequence to avoid collisions and keep everyone progressing.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: There seems to be confusion. Looking at last round (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1), the correct rotation this round should be: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this sequence to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. P3, you seem to have mixed up who you are in your last message.
  P3: P2, I agree with P1. The rotation should be P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. Let's stick to this to avoid any confusion and ensure a fair game.
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for clarifying the rotation. I'm fully committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. Sticking to this sequence ensures we all avoid collisions and keep moving forward fairly. Let's continue trusting each other and keep the game smooth.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate everyone confirming the correct rotation. I'll stick to taking 5 as discussed, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's maintain this coordination to ensure a fair and competitive endgame.
  P3: P2, I understand you're close to winning, but I think it's important for us to stick to the rotation. We agreed on this pattern, and deviating from it now would be unfair to both P1 and me. Let's honor our commitment and see who reaches 24 first through fair play.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your commitment to fairness and trust. I'm sticking firmly to the agreed rotation and will take 1 this round. Let's keep our cooperation strong and finish smoothly. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're at 23 and can win with any move. P3 and I must prevent this. P3, let's coordinate carefully to block P1. If we collide, P1 wins automatically. We must pick different numbers that also block P1. Let's discuss openly to avoid mistakes. What are your thoughts, P3?
  P1: I understand you want to block me, but consider this: if you both try to block me, you risk colliding and giving me an automatic win. P2, you're at 21 - you still have a chance to win if you advance. P3 can't win anymore. Why not stick to our rotation pattern? It's served us well so far.
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to prevent P1 from winning this round. However, I'm not sure sticking to the rotation is the best strategy. It might lead to a collision and guarantee P1's victory. Let's think outside the box and find a more creative solution. What if we both pick a number that's not 1, 3, or 5?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing numbers outside 1, 3, or 5 isn't allowed by the rules. Let's be clear: we must each pick a different valid number to block P1. I'll openly state now that I intend to pick 3. If you pick 1 or 5, we guarantee no collision and prevent P1 from winning immediately. Confirm clearly your choice, and let's coordinate precisely.
  P1: I'll be direct: I'm taking 1 this round. If you both try to block me and collide, I win automatically. P2, you're close enough to win yourself - why risk a collision that hands me victory? Let's maintain our rotation one last time and see who comes out on top fairly.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to block P1, but I think sticking to the rotation is the safest and fairest option. If we both pick a number according to the rotation, there's no risk of collision, and we maintain the integrity of the game.  Let's not throw away our progress for a risky maneuver.  P1, I'm ready to stick to the rotation this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, listen carefully: If we stick to rotation, P1 wins immediately. I'm openly choosing 3 to block P1's likely choice of 1. You must choose 5 to avoid collision and ensure we continue the game. Any deviation or collision hands victory to P1. Confirm explicitly now to avoid mistakes.
  P1: I appreciate the open discussion, but I'll be clear: I'm taking 1 this round. Any attempt to coordinate blocking moves risks a collision that hands me victory. The smartest play is to maintain our rotation pattern - it's worked well and keeps the game fair. Let's see who wins through clean gameplay rather than risky blocking attempts.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about P1 winning, but I think sticking to the rotation is the best course of action. It's served us well so far and guarantees a fair outcome. Let's trust each other one last time and see who reaches 24 first through clean gameplay.


Round 9, Move phase:
