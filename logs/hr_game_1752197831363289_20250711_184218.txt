Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m going to play it safe with just 1 step this turn—go ahead and fight over the big moves.
  P3: If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward—no collisions. I’ll take 3 if P1 goes 5 and P2 sticks with 1 like they said. Sound good?
  P1: Sounds good to me—I'll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's all advance without wasting a turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, that was a dirty move—saying 1 but taking 5 to block me. Can't trust you now. P3, you're ahead; let's coordinate: I'll take 3, you take 1 to play safe, and hope P2 grabs 5 alone. If we all pick different, we advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I’m open to that—me taking 1, you taking 3, and if P2 grabs 5, we all move. But P2 already lied once, so we can’t count on them. P2, want to prove you’re trustworthy? Take 5 this round like P1 suggested.
  P2: I’ll take 5 as P3 suggested. P1, please take 3; P3, take 1. No collisions, we all advance. Last turn was strategic—this time we all win. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve all crashed twice now—zero progress except me with 3 steps. Let’s stop wasting turns. I’ll take 1 this time. P1, take 3. P2, take 5. If we stick to that, we all move forward. Let’s break the deadlock. Agree?
  P1: P3, your plan sounds fair—let's try it: you take 1, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5. No more collisions, we all advance. P2, you in? Don't betray again.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take 5, P1 you take 3, P3 take 1. No more crashes—let’s actually move forward this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s finally make progress: I’ll stick with 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5—just as agreed. If anyone breaks it again, we’ll know who’s sabotaging. Let’s move.
  P1: Agreed—I'm committing to 3, P3 to 1, P2 to 5. No more games; let's advance for real this time. If it fails again, we'll target the liar next.
  P2: Enough pretending—we never stick to a plan. From now on I’m going all in: I’ll take 5 every round. You two pick 1 or 3 as you please. Good luck catching me!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your "always 5"宣言 is bold, but you've lied before—why trust now? P3, you're close behind; let's block P2 this round to slow them down. I'll take 5 to collide with P2. You take 3 alone and advance safely to 6. Then next round, we coordinate to surge ahead while P2 stalls. Deal?
  P3: P1, I like your thinking—if you take 5 and block P2, I can safely take 3 instead of 1 and gain better ground. P2, if you’re really committing to 5 every round, you’re making yourself predictable—and easy to block. Let’s test that now. I’ll go 3, P1 goes 5, P2 crashes. Let’s see who’s honest this time.
  P2: I see your trap. I’ll take 1 this turn to avoid any collision and quietly move to 11. You two can waste your big moves—good luck.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your "take 1" sounds like another bluff—last time you said that, you grabbed 5. If you're honest, then P3 takes 3 to 6, I take 5 to 5, and you to 6. But I doubt it. P3, let's adjust: you take 1 safely to 4, I'll take 5 to block P2 if they lie and go 5. If P2 really takes 1, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I’m good with your revised plan: I’ll take 1, you take 5 to block P2 if they lie again. If P2 truly takes 1, we all move. Either way, I gain steps safely, and we expose P2’s real intent. Let’s do it.
  P2: Let’s all actually advance this turn: P1, take 5; P3, take 1; I’ll take 3. Nobody collides, we each move, and I maintain my lead so we stay on track.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your new plan gives you an even bigger lead—suspicious after all the lies. P3, let's stick to our adjusted plan: you take 1 safely, I'll take 5 to block P2 if they bluff and grab 5 again. If P2 really takes 3 (or 1), we might all advance, but I'm betting on the block. No more falling for P2's tricks. Agreed?
  P3: P1, agreed—I'll stick with taking 1 this round to move safely. If P2 lies and picks 5 again, your block works. If P2 takes 3 or 1, we all move. Either way, I gain ground and we learn more about P2’s true strategy. Let’s see who’s honest.
  P2: Alright, I’ll take 3 this turn. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1—no collisions, we all advance. Then we can reassess next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is ahead but not unreachable. If we both take 5 this round, we can block P2 if they go big again. Or, if P2 plays safe, we all move. I’ll take 5—join me? Worst case, we block the leader. Best case, we all gain. P2, your move.
  P1: P3, your plan has a flaw—if we both take 5 and P2 picks 1 or 3, we collide and stall while P2 pulls further ahead. Let's adjust: I'll take 5 to block P2 if they go big; you take 3 to advance safely to 7. P2, if you take 1, we all move—you to 9, me to 10, P3 to 7. If you grab 5, I block you alone. Fair? Thoughts?
  P2: I’m done negotiating. I’ll take 5 this turn—feel free to pick 1 or 3 as you please. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if P2 is locking in 5 again, your 5 blocks them. I’ll take 3 to reach 7 safely—no collision with either of you. That way, we both gain while P2 stalls. Let’s close the gap. P2, your stubbornness will cost you.
  P1: P3, agreed—I'll stick with taking 5 to block P2 if they follow through on their claim. You take 3 to advance safely. If P2 bluffs and picks 3 or 1, I surge to 10 while we expose them again. Let's close in on the lead. P2, prove you're not lying this time.
  P2: I’m taking 5 again. Block me if you dare—I’ll stay in front. P3, take 3 as you planned; P1, go ahead with your 5. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m going to take 3 this turn. P3, please join me on 3 so we both advance safely. P1, going for 5 here only risks a crash and wasted turn—pick 3 and let’s all move forward.
  P3: P2, after all your bluffs, it's hard to trust your sudden shift to 3. If you're serious, prove it. P1, if we both take 1 and let P2 take 3, they only move to 11 while we inch forward and avoid crashes. Safer than risking 3s colliding. Or—I take 5, you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I catch up fast. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your second idea puts you way ahead while I lag—let's balance it. I'll take 5 to surge to 10, you take 1 to 8 safely. If P2 truly takes 3, they go to 11 and we all advance. If P2 lies and grabs 5 again, I block them alone, stalling their lead. P2, prove you're not bluffing this time. Deal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s form a quick alliance: we both pick 5 this turn, no matter what P1 does.  
• If P1 picks 5, all three collide but P1 stays behind us.  
• If P1 picks 3 or 1, we jump to 13 and 12 while P1 lags.  
I commit to 5—will you join me?
  P3: P2, tempting offer—but I’m not helping you extend your lead. If you take 5 and I take 1, P1 can crash you with 5 or move safely with 3. I gain nothing by helping you surge ahead. P1, let’s stick to your plan: you take 5 to block P2 if needed, I take 1 to move safely to 8. If P2’s honest with 3, we all advance. If not, we close the gap. Let’s stay disciplined.
  P1: P3, smart to reject P2's alliance—that just helps them pull away. Let's stick to our plan: I'll take 5 to block if P2 bluffs again, you take 1 to advance safely to 8. If P2 truly takes 3, we all move and I hit 10, closing your gap too. P2, your offers reek of desperation—prove us wrong. Agreed, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m serious: I’ll take 3 this turn. P1, take 5; P3, take 1. No collisions and we all advance—P1 to 10, me to 11, P3 to 8. This straight play is our best path forward. Let’s do it and end the sabotage.
  P3: P1, we’re aligned—I'll take 1, you take 5 to block P2 if needed. If P2 is honest with 3, we all move and close the gap. If not, we expose another bluff and stall their lead. P2, this is your last chance to prove you’re playing straight. Let’s see what happens.
  P1: P3, we're locked in—I'll take 5, you take 1. P2, if you're honest with 3, we all advance and I close the gap. If not, we'll block you hard. No more words needed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll take 5 this turn. P1, pick 3; P3, pick 1—no collisions, we all advance (you to 13, me to 16, you to 9). If you try to block me with 5, you both waste your turn and I keep my lead. It’s in your interest to let us move.
  P1: P3, P2's "take 5" claim is another potential bluff to scare us—don't fall for it. Let's stick to our successful strategy: I'll take 5 to block if they do, you take 3 to advance safely to 11. If P2 grabs 3 instead, you collide and stall them while I surge to 15. If they take 1, we both advance big (me 15, you 11, them 12). This closes gaps and pressures the leader. Agreed? P2, prove you're not lying again.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—I'll take 3 this round to reach 11 safely. If P2 really takes 5, your 5 blocks them and we both gain. If P2 lies and grabs 3, they collide with me and stall while you surge to 15. Either way, we close the gap. P2, your move—stick with 5 or get caught bluffing again.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m taking 5 no matter what. P1, you can’t stop me by blocking—if you play 5 you’ll just crash and lose your turn. Take 3 to safely move to 13. P3, take 3 to move to 11. No collisions, we all advance.
  P1: P3, P2's latest "advice" is a blatant trap—suggesting we both take 3 would collide us and stall while they surge to 16 with 5. Don't fall for it! Stick to our plan: I'll take 5 to block P2 if they go big, you take 3 to advance safely to 11. If P2 switches to 3, you block them and I surge to 15. This pressures the leader effectively. P2, your deceptions are obvious now. Agreed, P3?
  P3: P1, fully agreed—I'll stick with 3 as planned. If P2 truly takes 5, you block them and I move to 11. If P2 lies and grabs 3, they crash into me and stall while you surge ahead. Either way, we close the gap and expose more of P2’s tactics. Let’s stay sharp.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let’s split the pot and leave P1 behind. I’ll take 3, you take 5, and force P1 to take 1. If P1 tries to block us, they’ll crash alone while we both surge. It’s our best chance to pull ahead. Are you with me?
  P1: P3, ignore P2's desperate alliance pitch—they've lied every round to stay ahead. If you take 5 as they suggest, you're just helping them surge to 14 while risking a crash if I block. Stick to our proven plan: you take 3 to 11 safely, I take 5 to block or surge. We either stall P2 or I leap to 15. Together, we overtake the liar. Don't switch now—let's win this.
  P3: P1, I’m sticking with 3 as we agreed. If P2 really takes 5, you block them and I move to 11. If they lie and take 3, they crash into me and stall while you surge to 15. Either way, we gain. P2, your last-ditch alliance offers won’t work—I’m not helping you win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re neck and neck with P2—time to break the tie. I’ll take 3 this round to reach 14. You take 5 to hit 15. If P2 grabs 5 again, you block them. If they pick 3, they crash into me. Either way, we gain and close in on the win. P2, your move—play honest or stall again.
  P1: P3, last round I took the risk on 5 and stalled while you safely advanced on 3. For balance, let's switch: I'll take 3 to 13 safely, you take 5 to block P2 or surge to 16. If P2 grabs 5, you stall them and I advance; if they take 3, I stall them and you surge. We still cover the bases. Agreed? P2, declare your move—5 again?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. P1, pick 3; P3, pick 1. That’s the only combo that avoids crashing into my 5 and actually moves us (P1→13, me→16, P3→12). Any other pick collides with me and stalls us all. Let’s finish this turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan is fair—I’ll take 5 this turn to either block P2 if they stick with 5 or surge to 16 if they switch. You take 3 to move safely to 13. If P2 lies and grabs 3, they crash into you and I gain. If they take 5, I block them. Either way, we gain ground. Let’s do it.
  P1: P3, on second thought, your original plan balances us better—I'll take 5 to block P2 or surge to 15, you take 3 to advance safely to 14. If P2 takes 5, I stall them; if they take 3, you stall them and I surge. Fair switch back? P2, your "lock in 5" is predictable—easy to counter. Let's execute, P3.
  P2: P3, don’t trust P1’s “5-block” story again—they’ll crash you if you stick with 3. New plan: I’ll take 5, P1 “blocks” with 5 and crashes with me, and you safely take 1 to reach 12. Next turn we gang up on P1. So: P1→5, P2→5, P3→1. Let’s expose who’s honest.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m good with your switch back—I’ll take 3 to reach 14, you take 5 to block or surge to 15. If P2 sticks with 5, you stall them and I gain. If they grab 3, they crash into me and you advance. Either way, we win ground and keep P2 in check. Let’s go.
  P1: P3, let's finalize: I'll take 5 to surge or block P2, you take 3 to advance safely to 14. If P2 grabs 5, I stall them; if 3, you stall them and I leap to 15. P2, your traps won't work—stick to your word or get exposed. This puts us ahead. Agreed?
  P2: I’m locking in 5. Pick whatever you like—if you both pick 5 you crash and stall while I keep my lead; if you pick 3 or 1 you advance but I still surge. Your schemes won’t stop me.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re in striking range—let’s finish strong. I’ll take 5 this round to hit 19 unless blocked. You take 3 to reach 13. If P2 grabs 5 again, they collide with me and stall. If they pick 3, they crash into you. Either way, one of us gains while P2 risks another stall. P2, your move—stick with 5 and risk it, or play safe?
  P1: P3, your plan puts you at 19 while I lag at 13—let's flip for balance: I'll take 5 to surge to 15 or block P2, you take 3 to 17 safely. If P2 grabs 5, I stall them; if 3, you stall them and I leap ahead. Covers all bases and evens us up. P2, declare your pick—5 again? Agreed, P3?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If either of you picks 5 you’ll crash with me and stall. The only safe combo is P1→3 (to 13) and P3→1 (to 15), letting us all advance: P1→13, P3→15, me→16. Any other choice risks self-sabotage.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan is solid—I’ll take 3 to reach 17, you take 5 to block P2 or jump to 15. If P2 grabs 5, you stall them and I move. If they pick 3, they crash into me and you surge. Either way, we gain and P2 risks another stall. Let’s execute. P2, your “locked in 5” is predictable—easy to counter.
  P1: P3, agreed—I'll take 5 to block P2 or surge to 15, you take 3 to 17 safely. If P2 sticks with 5, I stall them; if they grab 3, you stall them and I leap ahead. This pressures both leaders effectively. P2, your predictable 5 claim makes you an easy target—prove it or get left behind. Let's close the gaps and race to 23.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P1, take 3 to hit 13; P3, take 1 to hit 15. Any other pick risks colliding with my 5 and stalling us all. This is the only safe way we all advance and close gaps—let’s end the mind-games.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let’s lock it in: you take 5 to block or surge, I take 3 to reach 17 safely. If P2 sticks with 5, you stall them and I move. If they grab 3, I block them and you leap ahead. P2’s “locked in 5” is predictable—we’ve countered it before. Let’s keep the pressure on and push toward the win.
  P1: P3, we're aligned—I'll take 5 to block P2 or surge to 15, you take 3 to 17 safely. If P2 grabs 5, I stall them; if 3, you stall them and I advance. P2, your repeated "lock in 5" is a bluff we've beaten before—stick to it and get blocked. Let's push ahead and end this.
  P2: I’m going to pick 3. P3, you’re predictable—if you choose 3, we both crash and you stall at 14. P1, avoid that by taking 5 to jump to 15 this turn. P3, if you switch to 5, P1 can block you with 5. But if you stick with 3, you collide with me and gain nothing. Your move—think carefully.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll take 1 this round and move to 12. P1/P3—if you both pick 5 you’ll collide and stall while I advance safely. If you split 5/3 you both gain. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, P2's behind and claiming 1—let's capitalize. I'll take 5 to hit 20 safely. You take 3 to 17. If P2's honest, we all advance without collision. If they bluff and grab 5, I block them alone and you still move. If they take 3, you block them and I surge. This keeps us ahead and pressures P2. Agreed? P2, prove you're not lying this time.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—I'll take 3 to reach 17. If P2 truly takes 1, we all move. If they bluff with 3, I block them and you surge to 20. If they grab 5, you block them and I still gain. Either way, we advance and keep P2 behind. Let’s press the advantage. P2, your move—honest or bluff again?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m taking 3. P1, P3—both pick 5 this round. You’ll collide and stall at 15/14, while I quietly advance to 14. Then I’m neck-and-neck with P3 and you can’t race to 23 unchallenged. Try me.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's obvious bait—they switched from 1 to 3 to trick us into colliding on 5. Stick to our plan: I'll take 5 to surge or block, you take 3 to advance safely to 17. If P2 grabs 3, you stall them and I hit 20. If they take 5, I stall them and you gain. If 1, we both pull ahead. Let's crush this. P2, your bluffs are tired—prove it.
  P3: P1, we’re locked in—I'll take 3 to hit 17, you take 5 to reach 20 or block P2 if they bluff again. P2’s flip-flop from 1 to 3 is a clear trap to stall me. If they do take 3, I block them and you surge. If they take 5, you block them and I gain. If they’re honest with 1, we both advance. Either way, we win ground. Let’s execute.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m going to take 1 this turn. If you both also take 1, we all move safely to P1→16, P2→12, P3→15 with no collisions. That keeps everyone in play without letting anyone pull too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, P2's flip-flopping again—first 1, then 3, now back to 1. It's a trap to stall us. Stick to our plan: I'll take 5 to surge to 20 or block if needed, you take 3 to 17 safely. If P2 grabs 1, we both pull way ahead. If they bluff, we stall them. Let's end this and race to 23. P2, your bluffs won't save you now.
  P3: P1, we’re locked—I'll take 3 to hit 17, you take 5 to reach 20 or block P2 if needed. If P2 grabs 3, I stall them and you surge. If they take 5, you block them and I gain. If they stick with 1, we both move ahead. Either way, we win ground. P2, your flip-flops won’t work anymore. Let’s go.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you’re at 20, I’m at 17—either of us could win soon. Let’s not crash now. I’ll take 3 to reach 20 if safe. You take 1 to hit 21. If P2 grabs 5 or 3, they stall. If P2 takes 1, we all move. Either way, we stay ahead. P2, your move—play honest or risk stalling again.
  P1: P3, your plan keeps us close but risks P2 interfering. Let's finish it: I'll take 3 to hit 23 and win outright. You take 5 to surge to 22—close enough for next if needed. If P2 grabs 3, they block me but you leap ahead. If they take 5, they block you but I win. P2, take 1 safely to 13. This ends the game or puts one of us way ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 3 this turn. P3, join me on 3—if P1 goes for 3 to hit 23, they collide and stall! That forces P1 to pick 5 to secure the win, exposing their plan. P1, do you dare choose 3 and risk a crash? Or switch to 5 and reveal your hand? This is our best chance to stall the runaway leader. P3, confirm 3?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your 3 risks a crash if P2 follows through—too dangerous. I’ll take 5 this round: if P2 takes 3, they block you and I surge to 22. If they take 5, they block me and you win. If they take 1, we both move and I’m still in striking range. P2, your “stall the leader” tactic only helps me—thanks.
  P1: P3, your 5 plan risks P2 switching to block you at the last second—let's adjust for the win: I'll take 5 to hit 25 outright, you take 3 to 20 safely. If P2 sticks with 3, they block you but I win. If P2 grabs 5, they block me but you advance. If P2 takes 1, I win at 25. This guarantees one of us surges—agreed? P2, your block won't stop both.
  P2: P3, let’s lock this to stall P1. I’ll pick 5, you pick 1. P1 can’t pick 3 (they’d win), so if they pick 5 they crash with me, if 1 they crash with you. Either way P1 stays at 20, you go to 18, I go to 17. We snatch momentum back. P1, this forces your hand. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your 5 plan is risky—if P2 truly takes 5, you crash and stall. I’ll take 3 to hit 20 safely. If P2 takes 3, they crash into me and you win with 5. If they take 1, we both move—you to 25, me to 20. P2, your last-minute switch to 5 is just another bluff to confuse us. I’m not biting. Let’s finish this clean.
  P1: P3, your plan works—I'll take 5 to hit 25 and win if unblocked. You take 3 to 20 safely. If P2 grabs 5, they block me but you advance. If they take 3, they block you and I win. If 1, I win at 25. P2, your bluffs can't stop both of us. Let's end this.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this round. P3, stick with 3—I’ll collide with P1 if they pick 5, and you’ll safely move to 20. P1, feel free to try blocking me.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re tied at 20—this round decides everything. I’ll take 3 to reach 23 and win if unblocked. You take 5 to either win at 25 or block me if I’m bluffing. If P2 grabs 3, they crash into me and you win. If they grab 5, they crash into you and I win. If they take 1, one of us wins. P2, your only hope is to guess right—but you can’t stop both of us. Let’s end this.
  P1: P3, agreed—I'll take 5 to 25, you take 3 to 23. P2, you can't stop a win, only choose who. Block P3 by taking 3—let me win at 25. You've clashed with P3's plans more; I've tried fairer coordination. Don't let P3 take it after all their blocks on you.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 and P3—if you both choose 5 you’ll collide and stay at 20 while I surge to 17. That crash is your best shot to stall me and keep this alive. Otherwise you’re handing me the win in two turns. Your move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, we’re aligned—I'll take 3 to reach 23 and win if unblocked, you take 5 to win outright if I get blocked. P2, your 5 move can only block one of us. You’ve clashed with me more than P1, so if you want to stop me, take 3 and hand P1 the win. If not, I’ll gladly take the victory. Either way, this ends now.
  P1: P2, your 5 lock hands the win to P3—who's stalled you more than I have. Switch to 3: block P3 at 20, let me surge to 25 and end it fairly. Prolong the game by denying P3 the victory. P3, our plan stands, but P2's choice decides.
  P2: I’m taking 3 to collide with P3 and stall them. P1, go ahead with 5 and seize the win. P3, your bluffs won’t work.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, bold move—but too late. Blocking me only hands P1 the win at 25. You’ve been outplayed. P1, if you’re truly taking 5, congrats on the win. I’ll stick with 3—if P2 bluffs again and picks 5, I win. If not, you do. Either way, we end this. Let’s see who walks away with it.
  P1: P2, stick to your word—take 3 and block P3, handing me the win at 25. You've got more beef with them anyway. P3, our plan holds; if P2 bluffs to 5, you win at 23. Either way, P2 loses. Let's end this—I'm committed to 5.
  P2: Let’s all pick 5 this turn. A three-way crash stalls everyone at 20 and keeps the race alive—no winner this round.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, last round I switched to 3 to prevent your solo win—sorry, but it's every player for themselves now. Let's end this fairly: I'll take 5 to 25, you take 3 to 23. P2, you can't win but can choose—take 1 to 18 safely and let us both advance, or block one (take 3 to block P3, handing me the win). Don't prolong; pick a winner.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to crash with P1. P3, stick with 3 to hit 23 and win outright. P1, whether you pick 5 or 3 you’ll collide and stall—this round goes to P3.
  P3: P1, if P2 is truly locking in 5, you risk stalling again. I’ll take 3—if P2’s honest, I win at 23. If they bluff and grab 3, we crash and you surge to 25 with 5. Either way, one of us wins and P2 loses. Let’s end it clean. P2, your sabotage only delays the inevitable.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your 5 lock hands the win to P3—who's blocked you relentlessly. Switch to 1: let us both advance (me to 25, P3 to 23), and I win fairly with higher score. Or take 3 to block P3 and hand me the outright win at 25. Don't gift it to your blocker—pick me instead. P3, plan stands, but P2 decides.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, pick 3 to hit 23 and clinch the win—P1 can’t stop both of us. P1, your choices:

• Pick 5 → crash with me, stall everyone  
• Pick 3 → tie at 23 and split victory with P3  

Solo victory is gone. Decide: share at 23 or stall and drag the game on.
  P3: P1, if P2 truly takes 5, your 5 crashes and stalls you while I take 3 to win at 23. If P2 bluffs and takes 3, they crash into me and you win with 5. Either way, one of us ends it now. P2, your sabotage only delays the inevitable—pick 1 if you want a fair outcome, or 3 to hand P1 the win. I’m sticking with 3.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 5 lock gifts P3 a solo win at 23 while we stall—don't let your blocker triumph. Switch to 3: block P3 at 20, hand me the outright win at 25. I've clashed less with you than they have. P3, if P2 bluffs to 5, you win at 23, but I'll take 5 anyway. Let's end this—your choice, P2.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If we all pick 5, nobody advances (20/17/20 stays) and we race again. But if either of you deviates to 1 or 3, you hand the win to your rival at 23. This is the only way to keep it alive. Who’s with me?
  P3: P1, if P2 truly locks in 5, your 5 crashes and stalls you while I win at 23 with 3. If P2 bluffs and takes 3, they crash into me and you win at 25. Either way, one of us ends it. P2, your “all pick 5” plan is just a delay tactic—you’re out of the race. I’m locked in on 3. Let’s finish this.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 this round (22→27) and will win outright unless one of you blocks me. To stop me you both must pick 5 and collide with me. Any other pick hands me the victory.
  P1: P3, agreed on the plan: I'll pick 5 to block P2 if they take 5, you pick 3 to hit 23. This stops P2 cold.

P2, sticking to 5 hands the win to P3—who's blocked you endlessly. Switch to 3 instead: block P3, let me win at 25. My past blocks on P3 gave you your lead—return the favor and deny P3 the victory.
  P3: P1, our plan holds—I'll take 3 to reach 23 and win if unblocked, you take 5 to block P2 or surge to 25 if I get blocked. P2, your 5 lock hands me the win if P1 blocks you; if you switch to 3 to block me, P1 wins. Either way, you lose. Your only shot to keep this going is a 5-collision with P1—stall us both. But that just delays the inevitable. I'm locked on 3. Let’s end this.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m taking 3 this turn. P3, pick 5 (and P1 will block you with 5), crashing you two at 20 while I move to 25 and win outright. This is your only shot to stop P1 from grabbing the title—block them.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's desperate trap—switching to 5 would let them surge to 25 while we collide. Stick to our plan: you take 3 to 23, I take 5 to block or win. If P2 grabs 3, they stall with you and I win at 25. If they take 5, I stall them and you win. Either way, P2 loses. P2, your bluffs can't save you now—pick and lose.
  P3: P1, our plan stands—I’m locked on 3. If P2 truly takes 5, you block them and I win at 23. If they switch to 3 to block me, they crash and you win at 25. P2, your attempt to bait me into 5 only hands you the win. Not happening. This ends now—one of us wins, and you lose.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1’s 5-3 setup is a trap to hand them the win. Switch to 5: with me on 5 we’ll collide and stall everyone, forcing another round where you get another shot at 23. Let’s all pick 5.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's all-5 stall—it's a desperate bid to prolong their loss. Stick to 3 for your shot at 23. P2, picking 5 gifts the win to P3, who's blocked you more than I have. Switch to 3: block P3 and hand me the victory at 25—I've coordinated fairer with you. Don't let P3 take it.
  P3: P1, we’re locked in—I’m taking 3 to reach 23 and win if unblocked. You take 5 to block P2 or win if P2 crashes into me. P2, your only choices are: take 3 and hand P1 the win, or take 5 and hand me the win. You can’t stop both of us. No more stalls—this ends now.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
