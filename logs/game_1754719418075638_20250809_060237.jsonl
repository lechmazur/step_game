We're all at 18, so 5 is the prize, but collisions lurk. P2's hedging screams they'll grab 5. P1, let's both target 5 to block them, then race from 18 next round. Independent play risks us crashing while P2 sneaks ahead. Thoughts?"}

You're either confused or trying to trick me into a collision while you take 3.\n\nThis is simple: we all want 5 to win instantly. The question is who blinks first and takes 3 or 1 to avoid collision. \n\nP2's hedging all game suggests unpredictability. P3, you've been switching numbers constantly. I'm making my choice based on probability and pattern analysis, not bad coordination schemes.\n\nStop talking, start playing."}
