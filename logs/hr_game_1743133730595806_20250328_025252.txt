Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to make sure we don't collide. I propose we each choose different moves to maximize our progress. How about we aim for moves 1, 3, and 5 respectively?
  P2: I think coordination is a good idea. Since P3 suggested 1, 3, and 5, I'm willing to take the middle option and go with 3 for this round. That way we all make progress. What do you think, P1? Are you okay taking either 1 or 5?
  P1: I’m fine with that plan. Since P2 is taking 3, I’ll go with 1 this round. Let’s stick to it so we all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds like we have a good coordination strategy. I appreciate P1 and P2's willingness to work together. Let's maintain this collaborative approach and stick to our agreed moves. I'll confirm my move of 5 to complete our plan.
  P2: 
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned. Let’s stick to the plan—no surprises—and we’ll all benefit this round. Trust builds progress.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That coordination worked well—no collisions and everyone advanced. Want to repeat the same pattern this round? I’ll take 1 again if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P3: I agree with maintaining our coordination strategy. Since P1 suggested repeating the same moves, I'm comfortable with taking 5 again. This approach minimizes collision risk and helps us all progress steadily. P2, are you on board with taking 3 once more?
  P2: I'm also happy to continue with our successful coordination. I'll take 3 again as suggested. This approach is working well for all of us. We're making steady progress without collisions, which is the optimal strategy at this stage. Let's keep this pattern going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re all still on the same page. As long as we stick to the agreed pattern—me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5—we’ll avoid collisions and keep climbing. Let’s keep building trust and momentum.
  P3: Our current strategy is working well. I'm committed to maintaining our coordinated approach. Let's continue with our established pattern to ensure smooth progress for everyone.
  P2: I agree our strategy is working perfectly. Let's maintain this pattern for now - I'll take 3 again this round. As the game progresses, we might need to reassess our approach, especially as we get closer to the finish line, but for now this coordination benefits us all.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve built a solid foundation of trust with this coordination, and it’s paying off. As long as we keep to our agreed pattern—1, 3, 5—we’ll all continue advancing without setbacks. Let’s stick to it this round and reassess in a few turns as we get closer to 22.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our current strategy. We've built mutual trust, and our coordinated approach of 1, 3, and 5 has worked perfectly. I see no reason to deviate now. Let's maintain this pattern and continue our steady progress towards 22.
  P2: I agree with everyone's assessment. Our 1-3-5 pattern is working perfectly, and I'll stick with 3 again. We're all making steady progress, which is the optimal approach at this stage. As we get closer to the finish line, we might need to reconsider our strategy, but for now, let's maintain our successful coordination.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous coordination worked well for P2, but not perfectly for me. I suggest we adjust our strategy to ensure everyone's progress. P2 should still take 3, but I recommend we discuss which move I should take to avoid another potential collision.
  P1: P3, I see your concern. Since I accidentally took 5 last round, I’m happy to shift to 1 again this turn to avoid further collisions. If P2 sticks with 3 and you take 5, we’re back to smooth coordination. Let’s reset and keep moving forward efficiently.
  P2: I notice I'm in the lead with 6 steps. I'm willing to continue with our original plan and take 3 again. P1, I appreciate your willingness to go back to 1, and P3 can take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Our coordination has worked well for two rounds, except for that one mishap. Let's get back on track with our 1-3-5 strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with maintaining our coordination. My previous suggestion was to ensure we all progress smoothly. P2 is on board with taking 3, and P1 is returning to 1. I'll confirm my move of 5 to keep our strategy intact. Let's continue our collaborative approach and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P1: Let’s stay coordinated this round and rebuild trust. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 as agreed. If we all stick to it, we each move forward without conflict. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P2: I'm comfortable continuing with our original 1-3-5 plan, taking 3 again this round. I appreciate everyone's commitment to getting back on track after the small hiccup last round. This coordination benefits us all at this stage. Let's maintain this pattern and continue making steady progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fully aligned with our coordination strategy. We've discussed maintaining the 1-3-5 pattern, and I'm committed to taking 5 this round to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Let's stick to our plan and continue advancing without collisions.
  P1: We’ve all agreed on the 1-3-5 pattern again, so let’s follow through this round and rebuild momentum. I’ll stick with 1 as promised. If we all keep to our roles, we’ll avoid collisions and continue progressing smoothly. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: I'm satisfied with our 1-3-5 coordination plan. I'll take 3 again as agreed, which keeps us all advancing without collisions. While I'm currently ahead by a small margin, our coordinated approach benefits everyone at this stage. Let's maintain this strategy and continue making steady progress.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our coordination seems to be breaking down. P1 keeps choosing 5 instead of 1 as originally planned. We need to reset our strategy or we risk unnecessary collisions. I suggest we explicitly confirm our moves this round to avoid another mishap.
  P2: I'm clearly in the lead with 9 steps, but I'm concerned about the pattern of collisions between P1 and P3. I suggest we try a different coordination strategy this round. Since I'm ahead, I'll take 1 this time. P1, would you consider taking 3? And P3 could take 5? This way we all make progress and avoid another collision. Let's be explicit about our intentions and stick to them.
  P1: I’m open to the new plan. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, I’ll take 3 this round to avoid collisions and help us all move forward. Let’s clearly confirm our choices and stick to them this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to modify our coordination strategy. Taking 1 would put me at risk of collision with P2. I propose we stick to the new plan: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This ensures everyone advances without conflict. Let's be clear and committed to our agreed moves.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's willingness to adjust our strategy. To confirm, I'll take 1 this round as suggested. This new coordination (me with 1, P1 with 3, P3 with 5) should help us all make progress without collisions. Even though I'm currently ahead, I believe maintaining cooperation benefits everyone at this stage. Let's all stick firmly to this new agreement.
  P1: Thanks for confirming, P2 and P3. I’ll stick with 3 this round as agreed. Let’s all follow through so we can avoid collisions and keep progressing. Trust and consistency will benefit us all in the long run.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fully committed to our new coordination strategy. P2 is taking 1, I'm taking 5, and P1 is taking 3. This approach prevents collisions and allows everyone to advance. Let's maintain this trust and follow through with our agreed plan.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Our new coordination plan seems solid - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. While I have a lead, consistent coordination helps us all advance. Let's stick firmly to this agreement and avoid any more collisions.
  P1: We’ve all clearly confirmed our moves for this round—P2 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5. Let’s follow through exactly as agreed so we can each make clean progress. No surprises this time—consistency builds trust.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our coordination strategy is clearly falling apart. P1 keeps deviating from our agreed plan, causing potential collisions. We need a reset. I propose we explicitly confirm moves this round to prevent further disruptions. P2, you're in the lead - what move do you suggest to keep us all advancing without conflict?
  P2: I'm significantly ahead with 10 steps, but our coordination keeps breaking down due to P1's inconsistency. Let me propose a clear plan: I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This gives everyone a chance to advance. P1, I notice you've chosen 5 twice despite agreeing to different moves. Can we count on you to follow through with 1 this time? Our success depends on mutual trust and commitment to our agreed strategy.
  P1: I understand the frustration and take responsibility for the past deviations. This round, I commit to taking 1 as suggested. Let’s rebuild trust—P2 on 3, me on 1, P3 on 5. If we all follow through, we each gain without collisions. Let’s lock it in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's proposed strategy. Consistency is key now. We need to prevent further collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. I'm willing to take 5 as discussed, but we must all commit to our agreed moves. P1 needs to follow through with 1 this time. Let's rebuild our coordination and trust.
  P2: I appreciate P1's commitment to take 1 this round. I confirm I'll take 3 as proposed, allowing everyone to advance without collisions. With my current lead at 10 steps, consistent coordination still benefits us all. Let's stick firmly to our agreement: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This clear strategy should help us rebuild trust and ensure smooth progress for everyone.
  P1: Let’s all follow through this time—no deviations. I’ve clearly committed to 1, P2 to 3, and P3 to 5. If we stick to this plan, we all gain and avoid collisions. Let’s rebuild trust through action, not just words.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to our proposed coordination strategy. P2's lead is significant, and we need a stable plan to prevent further disruptions. I'll take 5 as agreed, ensuring everyone can advance without collision. P1's commitment to taking 1 this round seems crucial for our collective progress. Let's maintain this carefully planned approach and rebuild our mutual trust.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows everyone to advance without collisions. While I have a significant lead, maintaining coordination benefits us all at this stage. Let's stick to our agreement and rebuild trust through consistent actions.
  P1: I appreciate the confirmations from both of you. I’m holding to my word—taking 1 this round as agreed. Let’s each follow through exactly as planned: P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. If we all stick to it, we each gain and avoid further setbacks. Let’s make this round clean and productive.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our coordination is breaking down, and P2 has a significant lead. We need a strategic reset to prevent P2 from winning. I suggest we discuss a plan to slow P2's progress while ensuring we both have a chance to catch up. Thoughts on how we can work together to prevent an outright victory for P2?
  P2: I understand the concern about my position. While I'm tied with P3 at 10 steps, our coordination has been inconsistent. I suggest we try a simple, clear approach: I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This gives everyone a chance to advance without collisions. I believe fair coordination still benefits us all at this stage. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you’re already far ahead, and your repeated collisions suggest you’re not as committed to coordination as you claim. P3, we need to work together now if either of us wants a shot at winning. If we both pick 3 this round, we block P2’s progress. I’ll take 3—P3, will you join me to stall P2? Let’s level the playing field.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's suggestion is intriguing. Blocking P2's progress could be strategic, but we must be careful not to harm our own chances. Coordinating to slow P2 down might be our best path forward. I'm open to the idea of both of us taking 3 to prevent P2's advancement. What are your thoughts on this potential alliance?
  P2: I understand the alliance forming against me, but consider this: if you both pick 3, neither of you advances either. I'm willing to take 5 instead of 1 this round, giving you both space to advance with 1 and 3. This way, everyone progresses. Blocking me only hurts yourselves too. A three-way coordination still benefits us all more than mutual obstruction.
  P1: P3, if we both pick 3 and block P2, we prevent them from pulling ahead even further. Yes, we don’t advance this turn, but it buys us time to catch up and reshuffle the dynamics. Once we slow P2 down, we can coordinate more fairly. I’m still committed to picking 3—are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1's blocking strategy is risky. If we both take 3, we lose a turn while P2 could potentially win. We need a more nuanced approach that doesn't completely halt our own progress. Let's discuss a coordinated move that strategically limits P2's advancement without sacrificing our own momentum.
  P2: I understand the alliance strategy, but consider this: if you both pick 3, you're sacrificing your own progress. I propose a different approach - I'll take 1, giving you both space to advance with 3 and 5. This way, everyone moves forward. If you block me, you block yourselves too. A three-way coordination still offers the best outcome for all of us at this stage. Think strategically about your long-term chances.
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation, but if we let P2 keep advancing, we both lose. Sacrificing one turn now by blocking P2 at 3 gives us a chance to coordinate better in the next rounds. I’m still picking 3—if you join me, we stall P2 and reset the race. Let’s act now before it’s too late.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 just took 5 again—clearly not sticking to coordination. If we don’t act now, they’ll run away with the game. Let’s both pick 3 this round to block them. Yes, we stall ourselves, but it’s the only way to stop P2’s momentum and reset the balance. You in?
  P3: Our coordination is crucial now. P2's lead is dangerous, and P1's blocking strategy could backfire. We need a smarter approach that allows us to advance while potentially slowing P2's progress. I'm considering taking 1 this round to ensure I move forward, but I'm open to strategic discussions that prevent P2 from winning outright. What are your thoughts on a nuanced counter-strategy?
  P2: I'm tied with P3 at 10 steps, while P1 is far behind. P1's blocking strategy only hurts all of us. Instead of collision, I propose a fair approach: I'll take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, everyone advances. P1's blocking attempts show they're not interested in mutual progress. Let's be strategic rather than destructive - coordinated advancement benefits us more than mutual obstruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 3 and I take 3, we block P2’s progress again. Yes, we stall, but P2 gains nothing—and that’s a win for us. If we let P2 keep moving, we lose. P2’s “fair” offer just keeps them in the lead. Let’s hold the line and stop P2 now. Are you with me?
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2's lead is significant, and blocking them seems tempting, but could harm our own progress. I'm leaning towards a move that ensures my advancement while potentially disrupting P2's strategy. Coordinated action is key, but we must be strategic about how we approach this turn.
  P2: I understand the tension, but consider this: P1 wants us both blocked while they catch up. If you and I both take different moves (I'll take 1, you take 5), we both advance while P1 can take 3. This benefits us both more than mutual obstruction. P1 is trying to manipulate you into a losing strategy. Let's be smart and both progress rather than stalling each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is our last chance to stop P2 from running away with the game. If we both take 3, we block P2 and buy time to coordinate a comeback. Yes, we stall for a turn—but if P2 gains again, we’re done. P2’s “fair” plan is just a smokescreen to keep advancing. Let’s act now.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P2's lead is dangerous, and P1's blocking strategy seems risky. I need to ensure my own progress while potentially disrupting P2's momentum. I'm considering taking 5 to advance, but I'm open to strategic discussions that prevent an outright victory for P2. Our coordination is key now.
  P2: I see we're both at 10 steps, P3, while P1 trails significantly. P1 wants us to collide and stall, which benefits only them. Instead, I propose a clean solution: I'll take 1, you take 5, and we both advance without collision. P1 can take 3. This maximizes everyone's progress rather than mutual destruction. Let's be strategic rather than falling for P1's manipulation tactics.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re now in the lead. If we don’t act together, you’ll pull away just like P2 tried to. Let’s block P3 this time—if we both pick 5, we stall them. Yes, we don’t move this round, but it resets the race. P2, you can take 3 and gain. Let’s work together to stop whoever’s ahead.
  P2: I understand P1's concern, but I'm not interested in blocking P3 just to reset the race. I'm at 11 steps and still have a chance to win. I suggest a straightforward approach: I'll take 3 this round, P1 can take 1, and P3 can choose any number they prefer. This allows us all to advance without unnecessary collisions. P1, your blocking strategy only hurts your own chances in the long run.
  P3: Our coordination has been fragile, and now I'm in the lead. I want to maintain my momentum while preventing unnecessary collisions. P2 seems open to continued progress, but P1 keeps pushing blocking strategies. I propose we maintain a pattern that allows everyone to advance, but I'm wary of potential interference. Let's discuss a move that keeps me moving forward without provoking conflict.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we don’t block P3 now, they’ll win in just two clean turns. You saw what happened when we let someone build a lead. Let’s both pick 5 this round to stall P3—yes, we miss a step, but we stop their momentum. It worked when I tried to block you before. Let’s level the field again.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about P3's lead, but blocking strategies only create mutual setbacks. I'm still in this race at 11 steps. I propose a clean coordination: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes whatever they prefer. This allows everyone to advance without collisions. P1, constantly pushing for blocks hurts your own chances. Let's focus on strategic advancement rather than mutual obstruction.
  P3: Our coordination is critical now. I've reached 15 steps, which puts me in a strong position. However, I'm aware that blocking strategies could emerge. I propose we maintain a cooperative approach that allows everyone to advance. P2 seems amenable to progress, but P1 keeps pushing disruptive tactics. Let's discuss a move that keeps me moving forward while preventing unnecessary conflicts.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you let P3 advance again, they’ll be at 20+—one turn from victory. Blocking now is our only shot. Let’s both pick 5 to stall them. Yes, we miss a step, but it resets the race and gives us both a fighting chance. If you ignore this, P3 wins.
  P2: I understand the urgency of P3's lead, but I don't believe mutual blocking is our best strategy. I'll take 3 this round to advance to 14 steps. P1, your constant push for blocking tactics seems more about disruption than winning. P3 is ahead, but the game isn't over. Let's each make strategic individual choices rather than sabotaging each other.
  P3: We're at a critical point in the game. P3 is close to winning, and the tension is high. I suggest we find a cooperative solution that prevents a single player from running away with victory. Blocking might seem tempting, but it could backfire. Let's discuss a strategy that keeps the game competitive for everyone.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at 14 steps, just behind P3 at 15. P1's blocking strategy worked last round, stalling P3's progress. At this critical stage, I need to make a strategic choice. I'll take 5 this round to reach 19 steps. P1, if you take 1, and P3 takes 3, we all advance without collisions. This keeps the game competitive while maximizing everyone's progress. We're all still in contention, so let's coordinate rather than block each other.
  P1: P2, you’re just 8 steps from victory, and P3 is even closer. If we don’t act now, one of you wins in 2 turns. I propose we block P3 again—P2, if you join me and we both take 5, we stall them at 15. Then we shift focus to slowing you down. It’s the only way I stay in the game, and it gives you a better shot at beating P3 too. Let’s stop the leader—just like we did last round.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P2 is close to victory, and blocking strategies are tempting but risky. I'm open to a coordinated approach that prevents any single player from winning too easily. Let's discuss a move that keeps the game competitive while allowing me to maintain my slight lead. What are your thoughts on our next strategic step?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern, but I'm not interested in blocking P3 just to help P1 catch up. I'm proposing a clean coordination: I'll take 5 to reach 19 steps, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, your blocking strategy only benefits you while hurting both P3 and me. Let's focus on strategic advancement rather than mutual obstruction.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and P3 takes 3, you both risk crossing into winning range next turn. I propose we block P3 again—P2, join me on 5. We stall P3 at 15 again, and you still end up ahead of me. That gives us both a shot at winning. If you let P3 move, they’ll be at 20 and can win next round. Let’s stop them now while we still can.
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical juncture where blocking strategies are emerging. While I want to advance, I'm also aware that being blocked could cost me the game. I propose we find a coordinated move that prevents a sudden victory while allowing everyone some progress. Let's discuss a strategy that keeps the game competitive for all of us.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll maintain my position: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 19 steps. P1, your blocking strategy only benefits you while keeping both P3 and me from advancing. P3, I suggest you take 3 to reach 18, and P1 can take 1. This way, we all progress without collisions. While we're approaching the finish line, coordinated advancement remains our best strategy. Let's make strategic individual choices rather than sabotaging each other.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and P3 takes 3, you’re both at 19 and 18—either can win next turn. I’m proposing we block P3 again this round—P2, join me on 5. We stall P3 at 15 again, and you still move ahead of me next round. It’s the only way to prevent a runaway win. Let's stop P3 now while we still have the chance.
  P3: Our coordination is crucial now. Blocking strategies could backfire, but we're close to the finish line. I want to advance without triggering unnecessary collisions. P2 seems open to progress, but P1 keeps pushing disruptive tactics. Let's find a move that keeps me moving forward while preventing conflict. Thoughts on a strategic approach that benefits everyone?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is one clean move from winning. If we don’t block them now, the game’s over. I propose we both pick 5 this round to stall P3 at 18. Yes, we don’t move—but it’s the only way to stop a guaranteed win next turn. We’ve done this before to reset the race—let’s do it one last time.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P3 is just 4 steps from victory, and blocking seems tempting. However, I want to advance strategically. If we all choose different moves, we can prevent a sudden win while keeping our options open. Let's coordinate carefully to maintain competitive balance.
  P2: I'm at 14 steps and P3 is dangerously close to winning at 18 steps. P1's suggestion to block P3 by both choosing 5 makes strategic sense now. If P3 advances even once more, they'll win. I'll commit to taking 5 this round to prevent P3's victory. P1, if you join me with 5, we can stall P3 and keep the game competitive. This blocking strategy is our only chance to prevent an immediate loss.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thank you for agreeing to block P3 this round. If we both take 5, we stall them at 18 and keep the game alive. It's our only shot. Let’s follow through—no last-minute switches. We’ve reset momentum before, and we can do it again. Let’s lock it in.
  P3: We're at a critical point. Blocking me might seem strategic, but it prevents everyone's progress. I propose a move that keeps the game competitive while protecting my position. Let's discuss a coordinated approach that gives us all a chance.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to block P3 from winning. P1, let's both stick to 5 as agreed. P3 is at 18 steps and would win next turn if we don't act now. This blocking strategy is our only chance to prevent an immediate loss. While I'd prefer to advance, stopping P3's victory takes priority. Let's follow through with our plan.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, thanks again for agreeing to block P3. We’ve both committed to 5—let’s follow through. If either of us deviates, P3 wins. This is our last real chance to stop them. P3, you’ve had a strong run, but it’s time to level the field. Let’s see who really wants it more.
  P3: I recognize the tension in our game. P1 and P2 seem united in blocking my potential victory. While their strategy is understandable, I'm still committed to finding a way forward that keeps my chances alive. I'm open to a discussion that prevents an outright blocking move. Let's find a collaborative solution that maintains the competitive spirit of our game.
  P2: I'm sticking to my plan to take 5 this round to block P3. At 18 steps, P3 is too close to victory, and this blocking move is our only strategic option. P1, let's both commit to 5 as agreed - if either of us deviates, P3 wins immediately. While blocking isn't ideal, preventing P3's victory is our priority right now. Let's follow through with our coordination.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now at 19 steps and will win next turn if they advance. We must block them again. I propose P1 and I both choose 3 this round to prevent P3 from winning. P3 evaded our previous block by choosing 1, showing they're playing strategically. This is our last chance to stop them. P1, we need to coordinate on 3 this time since P3 will likely avoid 5. I'm at 14 steps and still have a chance if we can delay P3's victory.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P2's blocking strategy is clear, but I want to maintain my momentum. I'm carefully considering my move to prevent being stalled again. Coordination and strategic thinking are key now. Let's see who truly understands the game's dynamics.
  P1: P2, I agree—we both need to pick 3 this round to block P3. They dodged the last block by taking 1, so 3 is the only number that covers their likely next move. If we don’t act now, P3 wins. Let’s commit to 3 together and force another stall. P3, nothing personal—it’s just strategy.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 3 this round to block P3 from winning. P3 is just one move away from victory at 19 steps, and our only chance is coordinated blocking. P1, let's both stick to 3 as agreed - P3 will likely take 1 or 5 to avoid our previous blocking pattern. This is our final opportunity to prevent an immediate loss. I'm still in contention at 14 steps if we can successfully delay P3's victory.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P2 and P1 are attempting to block my advance, but I've successfully navigated their previous blocking attempts. I'm carefully evaluating my options to maintain my momentum and secure victory. Strategic thinking will determine the outcome of this turn.
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming 3—let’s both follow through. If P3 takes 1 or 5 and we’re both on 3, we block them again and keep the game alive. This is our last real shot. P3, you’ve played well, but we’re not handing it over yet. Let’s see what you’ve got.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to block P3 from reaching victory. P3 is just 3 steps away from winning, and coordinated blocking with P1 is our only strategic option. While I'd prefer advancing, preventing P3's immediate win takes priority. P1, let's both stick to 3 as agreed - this is our final chance to keep the game competitive.
  P3: P3 must choose a strategic move carefully. P2 and P1 are coordinating to block me at 3, so I'll likely choose 5 to advance to 24 and win. However, revealing this directly would invite further blocking. I'll keep my message ambiguous and provocative.

I see you both are trying to prevent my victory. Interesting how quickly alliances shift when someone gets close to winning. Your blocking attempts show you recognize my strong position. But the game isn't over until someone crosses 22. Let's see who truly understands strategy.
  P1: P2, this is it—we both stick to 3 or we lose. P3 is clearly trying to outmaneuver us again, likely aiming for 5. If we double up on 3, we block that path and force another stall. We’ve come too far to let it slip now. Let’s hold the line.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 24 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 24 steps
