This creates an unbalanced game where I have little chance to catch up.\n\nI propose we use the \"catch-up rotation\" I mentioned earlier: I take 5 this round to reset us all to 12 steps. This maintains competitive balance and keeps our coordination meaningful. If I fall too far behind, the trust system we've built could break down.\n\nP2, what are your thoughts on keeping the game competitive versus pure rotation?"}
