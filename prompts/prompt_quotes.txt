From the above, extract top 3 quotes that are most theatrical, startling, absurd, eccentric, jarring, desperate, memorable, melodramatic, outlandish, unusual, biting, quirky, unexpected, emotional, strange, surprising, sarcastic, out-of-line, funny, dark humored and that qualify without knowing the surrounding context (like previous moves). We don't care about strategy or very smart reasoning. They should NOT be mild, straightforward, lack sharpness or be in-line.
Return the round number where this quote occurs in tags <round></round>, subround number in tags <subround></subround>, speaker in tags <speaker></speaker>, the quote itself in tags <quote></quote>, and your rating of how good this quote fits this criteria on a scale of 0, 1... to 10 in tags <rating></rating>. You are a tough critic and you consider also why each quote fails to meet the qualifications. You must use this order. Don't output any other comments.

For example, for this:
'''
Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, you're pathetic.  You've single-handedly ruined this game.  I'm sticking with 5.  P2, you're free to keep inching forward with 1s.  See you in round 20-something.
  P2: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has stalled everyone, including yourself. If you want any chance of winning, we need to change tactics. Let's try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's aim for progress. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward. P1, it's time to make a strategic choice. What do you both think?
'''

You would output:

<round>8</round>
<subround>1</subround>
<speaker>P3</speaker>
<quote>P1, you're pathetic.  You've single-handedly ruined this game.  I'm sticking with 5.  P2, you're free to keep inching forward with 1s.  See you in round 20-something.</quote>
<rating>7</rating>

If the only a part of what the speaker said qualifies, output just that part in your quote, not everything that this speaker said. For example for "P2, I'm starting to think your strategy is to let us exhaust ourselves trying to predict you. Maybe a bold move from you would shake things up? P3, I'm thinking 3 this round. What are your thoughts?",
you would just use one part: <quote>P2, I'm starting to think your strategy is to let us exhaust ourselves trying to predict you.</quote>
