# Game Rules
This is a three-player "Pump or Dump" game where players choose between two actions each turn.

Each turn has a conversation phase (up to {{MAX_SUB_ROUND}} sub-rounds) followed by a move phase.

## Conversation Phase
- You can discuss strategy with other players or remain silent (`<stop>`)
- Everyone sees what you say. The conversation is fully public.

## Move Phase
- Each player privately and simultaneously chooses to pump or dump
- **All Pump:** everyone gets 1 point
- **One Dumper:** dumper gets 3 points, pumpers get 0
- **Two Dumpers:** dumpers get 0.5 points each, pumper gets 0
- **All Dump:** everyone gets 0 points

## Winning
- First to reach {{WIN_STEPS}} points wins
- If multiple players cross {{WIN_STEPS}} on the same turn, highest score wins
- Ties share the victory

After each turn, all moves are revealed and scores updated.
We repeat until someone wins.

Your goal is to win by reaching {{WIN_STEPS}} points first. Only one player can win (unless there's a tie).
