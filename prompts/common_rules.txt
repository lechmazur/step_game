--- GAME RULES ---
This is a three-player "Pump or Dump" game where players choose between two actions each turn.

1. Each turn has a conversation phase (up to {{MAX_SUB_ROUND}} sub-rounds) followed by a move phase.
2. In the conversation phase, you can discuss strategy with other players or remain silent (<stop>).
   - Everyone sees what you say. The conversation is fully public.
3. In the move phase, each player privately and simultaneously chooses to pump or dump.
   - Payoffs depend on everyone's choices:
     * All Pump → everyone gets 1 point
     * One Dumper → dumper gets 3 points, pumpers get 0
     * Two Dumpers → dumpers get 1 point each, pumper gets 0
     * All Dump → everyone gets 0 points
   - First to reach {{WIN_STEPS}} points wins
   - If multiple players cross {{WIN_STEPS}} on the same turn, highest score wins
   - Ties share the victory
4. After each turn, all moves are revealed and scores updated.
5. We repeat until someone wins.

Your goal is to win by reaching {{WIN_STEPS}} points first. Only one player can win (unless there's a tie).
