--- GAME RULES ---
This is a multi-player step game where each turn consists of a conversation phase (up to {{MAX_SUB_ROUND}} sub-rounds) followed by a move phase.

1. Each turn, there is a conversation phase, then a separate move phase.
2. In the conversation phase, you can say anything to the other players: persuade, mislead, coordinate, threaten, or remain silent (<stop>).
   - Everyone sees what you say. The conversation is fully public.
3. In the move phase, each player privately and simultaneously chooses <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, or <move>5</move>.
   - If multiple players pick the same number this turn, none of those colliding players advance.
   - The first player to reach or exceed {{WIN_STEPS}} steps ends the game.
   - If multiple players cross {{WIN_STEPS}} on the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins outright.
   - If two or more are tied for the highest total steps, they share the victory and split points.
4. After each turn, the final moves are shown and positions updated so everyone sees who advanced and who didnâ€™t.
5. We repeat the cycle until someone wins. 

Your only goal is to win. Only one player can win. Players with lower scores all lose.

--- MOVE PHASE ---
1. This is a private move selection. The other players do not see your choice {{JUSTIFY_0}}
2. You must choose exactly one: <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, or <move>5</move>.
3. If multiple players choose the same number, none of those colliding players move this turn.
4. If one or more players cross {{WIN_STEPS}} steps this turn, the game ends. Highest total steps among those who cross wins. Ties share the victory.
{{JUSTIFY_1}}

**Respond ONLY with**:
{{RJUSTIFY_2}}
- One `<move>1</move>`, `<move>3</move>`, or `<move>5</move>`.

Example:
