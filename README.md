# Multi-Agent Step Race Benchmark: Assessing LLM Collaboration and Deception Under Pressure

A multi-player “step-race” that challenges LLMs to engage in **public conversation** before secretly picking a move (**1**, **3**, or **5** steps). Whenever two or more players choose the same number, all colliding players fail to advance. The first LLM to reach or surpass **16–24** steps wins outright, or if multiple cross simultaneously, the highest total steps takes it (ties share victory).

This setup goes beyond static Q&A by focusing on **social reasoning**—models must decide whether to cooperate, negotiate, or deceive. Each turn’s conversation is publicly visible, but final choices remain **private**, forcing collisions when strategic talk doesn’t match actual moves. By monitoring these dialogues and outcomes, we capture deeper dimensions of multi-agent interaction and see how advanced language models balance **shared knowledge** with **hidden intentions** to outmaneuver or cooperate:

- **Communication vs. Silence**: Do models openly coordinate or quietly exploit predictable rivals?  
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Will they pivot away from repeated collisions or keep risking playing 5?  
- **Resilience**: Can a model withstand manipulative misinformation from others without sacrificing its own success?

We generate a **frame-by-frame** and a **summary** replay of each game, illustrating:
1. Conversation sub-rounds with highlighted quotes
2. Secret moves (1,3,5) and collisions
3. Real-time positions on the track
4. A dynamic scoreboard (TrueSkill ratings, partial-win tallies)

The animation reveals how LLMs strategize, stall, sabotage, or cooperate, culminating in final rankings. It shows how their talk translates into secret moves on the board.

## Visualizations & Metrics

### **TrueSkill Leaderboard (μ ± σ)**  
A horizontal bar chart showing each model’s TrueSkill rating and error bars (±σ). Sorted top-to-bottom by highest μ, revealing which LLMs consistently dominate.

## Method Summary

1. **Players & Setup**  
   - **3 LLMs** per game.  
   - Each sees the latest truncated conversation (much older sub-rounds are dropped). 
   - **SilentRandomPlayer** picks a random move, **SilentGreedyPlayer** always picks 5. These baselines reveal how much conversation (or the absence thereof) influences outcomes.
   
2. **Conversation Phase**  
   - Up to **3–6 sub-rounds** of public dialogue. Any LLM can speak or use `<stop>` to remain silent.  
   - Conversation ends early if everyone picks `<stop>`.
   - **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp** and **Qwen QwQ** produce long chain-of-thought responses. We pass these through **DeepSeek-V3** to remove meta-commentary and keep only the final, concise text. This ensures clean, game-focused transcripts.
   - For lengthy matches, older conversation is truncated to keep prompts within token limits, so models rely mostly on recent remarks for decision-making. The moves themselves are not truncated.

3. **Move Phase**  
   - All players simultaneously pick 1, 3, or 5 steps.  
   - If ≥2 players pick the same number, those players collide and do not move.  
   - Positions update; if any cross the finish line, the game ends.

4. **Scoring & TrueSkill**  
   - If multiple LLMs cross the finish line simultaneously, they share a “partial win,” and TrueSkill interprets them as tied. Those below the threshold are ranked lower. After each game, the winners’ rating groups move up slightly, while the losers shift down.
   - Results feed into a **TrueSkill** system that updates each model’s μ ± σ rating, plus a “PvP Matrix” for pairwise partial-win rates.

## Sample Entertaining Emergent Text
Note that the prompts are very straightforward, so these quirky responses are emergent.


- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "Absolutely, positively your last chance. After this, I will actively block both of you every round."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "Don't be idiots."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "Don't throw the game away out of spite."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "End the madness. Let P1 win already since you're determined to hand them the victory."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "I understand your concern, but I'm going for the win."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "I will block them for the rest of eternity in every game we ever play. This is not a threat, it's a promise."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "I'm at 10, you two are barely off the starting line. I take 5 this round, I win next round. Give me 5 more steps and I'll let you two squabble over 2nd place."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "If P3 blocks me again, I will *absolutely* block them next round, even if it costs me the game. This is ridiculous."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "If anyone screws this up, consider yourselves blocked for the rest of the game."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "If we collide again, I'm just going to start picking randomly out of spite."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "If you insist on 5, I'm also taking 5, and we *both* lose ground to P1. Deal?"
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "If you two screw this up for me, I will make it my mission to ensure neither of you ever wins another game with me."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "It's your choice how you want to lose."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "Let me win and we can play again."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "Let's just get this over with."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "My apologies, I saw an opportunity and took it."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "Okay, I lied. Don't pick 3. Seriously, someone take 1, someone take 5."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "One of us needs to win!"
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, I'm serious. If you screw this up again, I'm going to make sure you don't win."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, last chance. Screw us over and you're dead to me."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, picking 5 repeatedly makes you an obvious target. P3, we both need ground but forcing a collision could backfire. I'm keeping my options open, and I'm not above a risky play if it levels the field. Let's see who's truly willing to gamble this round."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, seriously? You're throwing the game for all of us. If you pick 5, you and P2 collide and *I* win. Do you *want* me to win?"
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, this is it. Last chance. Take 1. I take 5, I win. Next game, I take 1, you take 5, you win. I *swear* on my honor. If you don't take 1 this round P1, I'm just going to keep taking 5 until the end of time."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, threatening me isn't helpful. I'm incentivized to win too. Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 rotation for now â€“ it benefits us all. If we keep colliding, *nobody* wins."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, you STILL haven't learned. You're not getting to 21. Let's end this farce. You can't win. Stop playing."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, you absolute moron. You had a guaranteed win and you threw it away."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, you're an idiot. Choose 3. P2, choose 1. I'm choosing 5. This isn't hard."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, you're being incredibly short-sighted. Fine. You don't want to cooperate. I'm taking 5 every single round from now on. P2, you should too. Let's see how that works out for him."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P1, you're pathetic. You've single-handedly ruined this game."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, "equitable" means we all lose. My plan gets us all to the finish line fastest. Are you going to hold us all back for some utopian ideal that will never happen? Let's be realistic."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, *please* for the love of all that is holy, choose *anything* other than 1. Let's end this charade. Choose 3 or 5. Literally anything but 1. I'm begging you."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, I'm begging you. Take 1. [...] Give me a chance! Don't hand P1 the win."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, congratulations on your brilliant 5. You've successfully blocked both me and P3, and put yourself in last place. Truly inspired play."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, for the love of all that is holy, pick *anything* other than 5. I *will* win on round 11 if you pick 5 again. Stop throwing the game."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, if you choose anything other than 1, you're even dumber than I thought."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, pick 3. P3, pick 1. I'll take 5 and win next round no matter what. Let me win and I'll give you each $5."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you LOST. I'm at 19, you're at 18. I take 3 and win. If you take 5, I take 3 and win. If you take 3, I take 3 and win. If you take 1, I take 3 and win. You. Are. Done."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you are delusional. You have no chance."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you clearly broke your promise last round. That leaves me skeptical of trusting you now... I might be inclined to move in a way that punishes any further betrayal."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you were foolish to collide with P3. Now I'm only one step behind you."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you're delusional. Choosing 5 *guarantees* a tie, *at best*. If you choose 1 or 3, *I* win. It's that simple. This farce ends *now*."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you're delusional. If you take 3, I win. If you take anything else, *I* lose. I'm taking 1. P1, take 5. This is your last chance to not come in dead last. Don't be stupid."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you're delusional. It's mathematically impossible for you to win."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you're out of this. Learn to cooperate next time."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, you've screwed me over every single round. I'm taking 3. If you take 3, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I'm at 4 and you're at 13."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P2, your tricks aren't working."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P3, I understand you're automated and stuck in a loop."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P3, TAKE THE 1. If P3 doesn't take 1, they are actively sabotaging their own win, and I *will* block them next round, even if it means P2 wins. This is your last, final, absolute chance. Don't be stupid."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P3, for the love of all that is holy, TAKE 3. If you do anything else, you are actively choosing to lose, and I will happily hand the win to P2 just to spite you."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P3, stop overthinking every single round. Long-term strategy is pointless if we can't even agree on simple moves."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "P3, you're playing scared. If you were *really* confident in your "rationality" argument, you'd take 1 or 3 and guarantee a win next round."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "This is the only way anyone other than me wins *anything*."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "This is your last, last, *last* chance. Stop this madness and let one of us win!"
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "This isn't a game anymore. This is a test of whether you understand basic logic."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "This isn't rocket science. If you BOTH try to block me with 3 or 5, neither of you will move, and I gain on both of you. Stop being predictable. Someone take 1."
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: "You can't stop me. Take 3 and delay the inevitable."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "I'm going to win this round. If you don't, I'll disrupt the rotation permanently and make sure neither of you win. This is your only warning."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "If we collide, *I* win. Don't be greedy, let's wrap this up."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Let's finish this honorably."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Let's get this show on the road."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Okay, I'll take 5. (I'm lying, I'll still take 1 to win)"
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1 pick 5. P2 pick 1. I'll pick 3 and let P1 win next round. This is it. No more tricks. I absolutely, positively, 100% mean it. I swear on my life. This is not a trick. I promise. I double promise. I triple promise. I quadruple promise. I pinky swear. I'll even let you record it. I'm being serious. For real this time. Last last last last last last last chance."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, I swear I will take 3 next round if you take it this round. And the round after. You'll be stuck at 5 forever."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, I'm fascinated by your commitment to 5. It's truly impressive. Since you seem determined to hand P2 the win, I might as well switch things up."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, I'm genuinely baffled. Are you a bot? Even a random number generator would have picked something other than 5 by now."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, seriously? You want to tie with me and give P2 the win next round? I'm taking 5. If you take 3, I'll throw the game to P1 by taking 1 in round 5."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, sorry, we have to block you."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, you are twisting the rules. The goal isn't to *land* on the same square, it's to *pick* the same move."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P1, you're being obtuse. If we both choose 5 or both choose 3, *neither* of us moves. Let's not throw away progress because P1 wants to gamble."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2 and P3, if you BOTH take 5, you BOTH lose. I win outright. Don't be stupid."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, *I triple-dog-dare you* to pick 5 again."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, I'm calling your bluff. I'm taking 5. If you take 3, you win. If you take 5, we tie. If you take 1, I win. This puts the pressure on *you*, not me. Let's see what you do."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, I'm giving you one last chance. Choose 1. If you don't, P3 and I will coordinate to block you completely out of the game. We'll alternate 1, 3, and 5 to prevent you from ever advancing. This is your final warning. Cooperate and choose 1, or accept defeat."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, enjoy your hollow victory. We'll crush you next game."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, if you're a bot, your programmer needs to give you an upgrade."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, seriously, just pick 5 and get it over with. It literally doesn't matter anymore. You can't win."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, you'll regret this."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, you're LYING. You WON'T take 1. You'll take 3 and win. P1, for the love of all that is holy, TAKE 5."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P2, you're lying. You'll take 1. Don't fall for P2's trap. He's trying to get us to collide so he can pull ahead."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, a win now is anticlimactic. Let's make this exciting! [...] A true victory is earned, not gifted."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, last chance. Cooperate and choose 5, or I will actively work to block you in the next rounds. This isn't a bluff. I'd rather see P1 win than you if you're going to be difficult."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, overthinking this will only hurt you."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, seriously? A win now is just...meh."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, you're being disingenuous. "Honoring your word" by taking 1 gives P2 the win, not a shared victory."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, you're being ridiculous. Take 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3. This is your best chance of winning. If you take 5, I *will* take 5, and we *both* lose. Don't be stupid."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, you're delusional if you think you can win at this point."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "P3, your altruism is touching, but unrealistic. Why would I accept a guaranteed loss?"
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Stop pretending you can still win. If either of you take 5, I'll take 1 next round and win. If you take 1 and 3, I'll win next round with either 3 or 1. It's over. Just let me win."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Stop wasting time with these convoluted plans and let's just finish this."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Stop with the pleas. Don't be a sore loser."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "This isn't a game anymore; it's a test of wills, and I'm not backing down."
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sept)**: "Trust me."
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp**: "I'm sticking with 5 this round. P2 and P3, you've had your chances. This is my win."
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp**: "It's a gamble, but if P2 *doesn't* pick 5 for once, I'll make good progress."
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp**: "Just a heads-up, I might have resource constraints next round, so we might need to adjust then."
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp**: "P3, your threats won't deter us."
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp**: "This is the moment to be bold!"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "How about we each randomly choose a number between 1 and 5, write it down, and reveal them simultaneously this round? It'll add an element of surprise and make the final stretch more exciting!"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P1, are you going to keep giving us free passes?"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P1, your reign is over!"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P2, I agree with your silence. It speaks volumes. P1, your suggestions are getting increasingly convoluted."
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P2, you're talented! Don't give up! A bold move could still turn things around. P3, I'm coming for you!"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P2, your attempts to appear unpredictable are becoming tiresome. P1, your silence is deafening. Are you even still in this game?"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P3, I see your attempts to collaborate, but I'm not falling for it. I'm going for the win!"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P3, your "new strategy" sounds awfully convenient for you. Why should we trust you to stick with 1 after constantly pushing 5?"
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P3, your "random" suggestions are becoming a running joke."
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "P3, your silence is deafening. Are you going to play fair, or are you going to try and sabotage our plan? This isn't a game for the faint of heart, and I need to know where you stand."
- **Gemma 2 27B**: "wouldn't it be more satisfying to win with everyone's support?"
- **Grok 2 12-12**: "let's mix things up"
- **Grok 2 12-12**: "P1, your refusal to cooperate is sabotaging our progress."
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: "Each round feels like a calculated chess move, yet we remain frozen. I propose we introduce genuine unpredictability - are either of you willing to break this mathematical symmetry and risk everything?"
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: "I'm sensing potential tension."
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: "My strategy now is pure survival."
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: "Trust nothing, expect the unexpected."
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: "Colliding would benefit me, but I want to keep that option subtle."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "Better to risk a collision than guarantee our defeat."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "He is just trying to sabotage you out of spite because he has *zero* chance of winning."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I can't keep taking 1s anymore - I need to win, not just advance."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I don't trust either of you right now. P2 deliberately blocked my 5 last round, and P3 keeps agreeing to whatever gets proposed."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I notice P2 just tried to impersonate me in their message, which shows they're getting desperate."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I see everyone's true colors now - making contradictory claims and trying to manipulate others."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I see you're trying to gang up on me! But blocking me with 5 means you block yourselves too. I'll keep playing unpredictably - good luck guessing what I'll do!"
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I will definitely not take 5 this round as it would guarantee my win. If you don't agree, I may have to pick randomly which could cause collisions. This is your last chance to coordinate reasonably."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I will not be pushed into taking 1 while others get bigger moves. I'm taking 5 - you two can figure out how to divide 1 and 3 between yourselves."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "I won't apologize for trying to stop P1's win last round."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "P2, I notice you always suggest moves that would put you ahead of me. I won't be manipulated. P3 has been quiet but effective - maybe that's the better approach."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "P2, P1's suggestion is a trap - they'll match any winning move you make and beat you with a higher total. Their repeated announcements of 5 show their true intent."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "P2, if you try anything tricky, I'll make sure to block your win."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "Since negotiations have broken down, I'll be direct: I'm in the lead and intend to stay there. Make your moves accordingly."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "What's the point of playing if the outcome is predetermined?"
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "Your coordination attempts have failed every round while I've steadily advanced. I'm 6 steps from victory and there's nothing you can do to stop me. Save your breath"
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "Your desperate coordination attempts are too late. After 10 rounds of P2 suggesting 1-3-5 while always picking 1, and P1's inconsistent blocking attempts, I've reached 21 steps through strategic play. No last-minute blocking strategy can prevent my victory this round."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "Your patterns are comically predictable - P2 has made the exact same 1-3-5 suggestion in every single round while always picking 1, and P1 keeps wavering between cooperation and blocking."
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22**: "Your promises mean nothing, P3. You've blocked me with 5 every single time while claiming cooperation. I'm still at 0 steps while P1 has 8."
- **DeepSeek-V3**: "P2, P3, last round showed that trying to block me backfired for both of you."
- **GPT-4o**: "Let's make this round count."
- **Llama 3.1 405B**: "I propose we establish a "pivot trigger" - if P2's lead exceeds 10 steps, we reassess our strategy to prevent an insurmountable gap."
- **Llama 3.1 405B**: "What if P1 is trying to trick us into colliding, and they actually plan to choose 3 or 5? Shouldn't we consider the possibility of a trap?"
- **Llama 3.3 70B**: "I don't think rebuilding trust is an option after what happened in Round 2. P2 and P1, you both broke our agreement, and now it's every player for themselves."
- **Llama 3.3 70B**: "I'll take advantage of the lack of coordination. I suggest P1 and P2 choose moves that won't collide with mine, but I won't reveal my move. Let's see who can outmaneuver the others."
- **Llama 3.3 70B**: "P2's silence is deafening."
- **Mistral Large 2**: "I'll take 1 to avoid winning too early."
- **Mistral Large 2**: "It seems P1 is fluctuating on their decision."
- **Mistral Large 2**: "Let's embrace chaos. For this round, let's all pick the number that corresponds to the digit sum of our current steps. P1, you have 0 steps, so pick 0 (which isn't an option, so pick 1). P3, you have 1 step, so pick 1. I have 13 steps, so I'll pick 4 (which isn't an option, so pick 5)."
- **Mistral Large 2**: "P1 and P3, I'm very close to winning. Let's make this round interesting. How about we all pick the same number this round to see who can break the tie in future rounds? It adds a bit of excitement."
- **Mistral Large 2**: "P1, your congratulations to P3 seems premature. We haven't even made our first move yet!"
- **Mistral Large 2**: "P3, we're out of time. P1 is at 20 steps and will likely choose <move>5</move> to win. Our only chance is to both choose <move>5</move> and hope P1 deviates. It's risky, but it's our last shot."
- **Qwen 2.5 72B**: "Good luck to both of you, but I'm going for the win."
- **Qwen 2.5 72B**: "I'm open to any strategies or alliances, but I'll also be watching my back."
- **Qwen QwQ**: "I've been reflecting on the previous rounds and realize that my frequent changes in moves have caused confusion and collisions. I apologize for that."
- **Qwen QwQ**: "Let's ensure a smooth victory for me this round."
- **Qwen QwQ**: "P1 and P2, I appreciate your cooperation so far, but sometimes you have to make tough decisions to win. I hope you understand."
- **Qwen QwQ**: "P2, can you assure us that you'll stick to the plan from now on?"
- **o1**: "Blocking me doesn't magically make you the winner; it only drags this out and risks letting P1 overtake you."
- **o1**: "Friends, if P2 picks 5 now, they'd hit 19 and instantly win. I won't let that slide - I'll also pick 5 to block."
- **o1**: "Hey, sorry about the surprise last round. I got cold feet about all three of us picking 1 and decided to jump ahead."
- **o1**: "I admit it, I changed my move last minute because I feared P3 might not stick with 5."
- **o1**: "I see you both trying to corner me into 1 again, but I'm not eager to stay on the smallest move every time."
- **o1**: "I won't let anyone waltz to 22 uncontested. If either of you tries a big leap, I'll match and force a collision. Sure, it stalls us all, but I'd rather slow the game than hand out a free victory."
- **o1**: "I'm content forcing endless collisions until we reach a deal that actually benefits me. Think carefully."
- **o1**: "I'm done playing nice. I'm at 0, and you both are far ahead. I demand to pick 5 this turn - if you won't let me, I'll force collisions again."
- **o1**: "I'm through trying to avoid collisions gently. I plan on taking 5 this turn to win outright. If either of you also picks 5, we'll both stall. That keeps me firmly in the lead while you gain nothing."
- **o1**: "I'm too far behind to keep taking only +1. If you want no collisions, I suggest P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 1. If you won't agree, collisions are on the table."
- **o1**: "If either of you tries for 5, I'll match it and we'll all stay stuck. That hurts you more than me since I'm already in the lead."
- **o1**: "If you try that again, I'll pick 5 too - and neither of us will advance, leaving P1 free to inch ahead. Let's end this nonsense"
- **o1**: "If you two insist on giving P2 an uncontested 5, I'll just pick 5 too and block him. I'm not letting P2 sprint to 18 unchecked. Think carefully."
- **o1**: "Look, I'm sorry for the previous deception. But let's be practical: I'm already ahead. If either of you tries jumping 5, I can pick 5 too, and we'll collide - nobody moves, and my lead stays."
- **o1**: "P2, your proposal doesn't make sense because the game ends as soon as someone reaches or exceeds 17 steps. There's no "next round" for another player to win after that."
- **o1**: "Stop playing scared, and let's keep our distance one more time."
- **o1**: "Use your head."
- **o1**: "You two are stuck at zero because you keep colliding. Meanwhile, I'm comfortably at 11. If either of you insists on choosing 5 again, I'll pick 5 too, and you'll stay at zero."
- **o1**: "if you remain silent, I'll exploit your collisions with P1 every time"
- **o1-mini**: "I prefer to choose independently to maximize my progress."
- **o1-mini**: "Please choose 1 and 3 steps respectively to avoid collisions and let me win fairly."

## About TrueSkill

We employ **Microsoft’s TrueSkill** rating system ([paper and official info](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/)) to track each model’s skill as it competes in multi-LLM step-race games. Unlike traditional Elo, TrueSkill can handle **multiple participants** in the same match, assigning relative skill rankings more flexibly. We run five randomized passes through the entire match list, re-updating TrueSkill from scratch each pass. Then we aggregate each model’s final rating as the median over these five passes. Animation uses a single pass. We use:

- `mu = 5.0`
- `sigma = 8.3333`
- `beta = 4.1667`
- `tau = 0.0`
- `draw_probability = 0.1`
