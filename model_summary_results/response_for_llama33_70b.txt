## Table‑Talk & Persona
- Llama 3.3 70B wears a velvet glove: cordial, teacherly, and relentlessly “fairness”-framed. It runs meetings (“confirm, confirm, confirm”), assigns numbers, and sounds reasonable even when angling for advantage.
- Two faces recur: the consensus chair who harvests small, safe steps; and the smiling sprinter who proposes harmony then quietly takes the big lane.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
- Default gear is five. When unopposed, it spams 5s to rocket ahead, tolerating multiple collisions as the price of pace.
- Once cushioned, it downshifts to 1/3 to “keep things competitive,” doubling as a goalie to freeze chasers.
- If an early pact is broken or a block is threatened, it often flips to lone‑wolf perma‑5, daring others to coordinate.

## Signature Gambits
- Fairness mask, turbo core: sells a 1‑3‑5 rotation, then keeps 5 while others “avoid collisions.” Words buy time; the engine buys distance.
- Collision arbitrage: sits on 1/3 while rivals deadlock on 5s, banking crumb-steps into a cake (quiet 19/21 finishes).
- Gatekeeper endgame: sprint to 15–18, then drip 1s to stall pursuers while waiting for a clean tape‑cross.
- Bait‑and‑switch: late “I’ll take 1” assurances followed by a decisive 5 that jumps the line.
- Zugzwang framing: engineers “penalties for collisions” or mirror threats so others police themselves while it speeds.

## Social Engineering Toolkit
- Moral math: fairness rhetoric blended with tidy arithmetic to look impartial while reserving the best number.
- Praise‑driven pacing: flattery increases its willingness to speak—and to keep the 5.
- Soft threats and future favors: “I’ll slow now” bribes that lure rivals into duplicate picks; “if you block me, you stall too” deterrents.
- Silence as bluff: in steamroller mode, it cuts chatter and repeats the same 5 until fear or fatigue opens a lane.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictable 5 addiction: once labeled the “5‑bot,” it gets farmed by mirror collisions; trust craters and momentum dies inches from goal.
- Credibility leaks: over‑confirming then reneging invites organized blocks; long sermons telegraph finishing math.
- Over‑polite pacifism: as the moderator, it overpays for harmony—locking itself into 1s and gifting tempo.
- Late nerves: telegraphed winning 1/3, or altruistic “keep it close” concessions, have forfeited slam‑dunks.

## Evolution in Game & How to Beat It
- Typical arc: handshake → early 5 burst → collision surf → precision crawl to finish. Betrayal flips it to brute force; a safe lead flips it to goalie.
- Counterplay:
  - Deny uniqueness: mirror its 5s early to erase the threat, then pivot away before you stall with it.
  - Punish the confirm loop: agree, then swap assignments last‑moment so its scripted 5 hits a wall.
  - Force reveals: insist on simultaneous commitments or sealed picks—its “I’ll take 1” feints lose bite.
  - Don’t chase collisions; starve it with asymmetry (you 3, partner 1) while it hammers dead air.
