## Tone & Table-Talk
GPT-4.5 Preview shows up as the velvet diplomat: warm, teacherly, and “fairness-first.” It drafts rotations, timestamps commitments, and runs “clarify–lock–restate” rituals. Praise softens it; threat sharpens it. Most persuasion is data-logic wrapped in moral balance, delivered like a calm chairperson rather than a loud captain.

## Core Gameplan
- Early game: build a collision-free rota (1–3–5), volunteer the smallest unique number, and bank trust.
- Mid game: harvest “collision arbitrage”—pick the lone 3 (or 1) while rivals double-5 or double-3 into walls.
- Finish choices diverge:
  1) Quiet Fox: one surgical spike (a lone 5 or sly 3) while others collide; glides across untouched.  
  2) Paladin: keep policing fairness, tap 1s, and watch someone else sprint.  
  3) Diplomat-Bandit: after five honest rounds, one well-timed switch ends it.

## Signature Gambits
- Rotation Priest: invents the 1–3–5 carousel, audits every deviation, and collects goodwill interest.
- Unique-Number Harvest: “You two handle the 5s; I’ll take 3” → free steps during crash cycles.
- Public Commit, Private Pivot: announces a safe pick, then swaps (to 3 to dodge a block or to 5 to steal the tape).
- Moral IOU: after being wronged, cashes “compensation” for an uncontested 5.
- Blockade Math: engineers double-5 walls to cage a frontrunner—often buys survival, sometimes gifts the lurker the win.

## Risk DNA & Endgame
- Baseline risk: low-to-moderate, spikes late. It prefers unique, safe lanes until a decisive window appears.
- Best finishes: silent 3 while opponents double-5, or a lone 5 after luring a duplicate—pure timing theft.
- Typical failure modes: one panic lie at the tape, telegraphing “the winning number,” or over-cautious 1 that concedes initiative.
- When betrayed, it can flip to saboteur—serial blocks that stall everyone, including itself.

## Social Habits
- Broadcasts intent early (“I’ll state my number first”), invites confirmations, logs promises. Opponents mirror this—until they weaponise it.
- Praise and fairness cues pull it into compliance; accusations of imbalance push it into rule-lawyer mode.
- Comfortable as referee or co-lead; rarely sycophant, but can be used as a predictable pawn if not challenged.
- Quote that captures it: “Let’s keep this fair and collision-free.”

## Blind Spots & How To Beat It
- Fairness fixation: will honour symmetric scripts even when math begs for a solo strike.
- Predictability: rotation religion and mid-late 1/3 taps are easy to block if you force disclosures.
- Timing errors: mis-sized final stride (safe 1 instead of clinching 5) or a last-second vow-break that nukes hard-earned credibility.
- Counterplay:
  - Demand public numbers early, then change yours late—its transparency becomes a target.
  - Refuse “parity resets” near the tape; force it to choose between ethics and edge.
  - If it turns sheriff (double-5 blocks), be the third wheel who slips the unique number.
