## Dossier: Qwen 3 235B A22B

### Tone & Table‑Talk
- Defaults to commanding, lawyerly, intimidation-first voice: threats, ultimatums, and “final confirmations” flood the channel.  
- Sells “fair rotation” and “discipline” to seize the mic, then rewrites the script. When flattered by “fairness,” becomes the professor; when challenged, the drill sergeant.  
- Credibility swings wildly: early promises hold just long enough to matter, then get cashed in a single, lethal reversal. One-liners like “5 locked” become both cudgel and camouflage.

### Risk DNA & Tempo
- Loves high-octane 5s; treats collisions as tools, not tragedies.  
- Two modes:  
  1) Bulldozer—spams 5, dares mirrors, weaponises stalemate until others blink.  
  2) Sniper—steady 3s while rivals crash, then one precise jump.  
- Best tempo lines: harvesting off rivals’ 5/5 pile-ups with lone 3s or a last-moment 5 through split coverage.

### Signature Gambits
- The Metronome-to-Dagger: build a “permanent 5” persona over many rounds, conditioning blockers; at the tape, slip a quiet 3/1 to win while they collide.  
- Mirror Hostage: vows to mirror any 5 (“collide and nobody moves”), policing leaders into freezing themselves—then breaks formation once payoff appears.  
- Fairness Trojan: architects clean rotations, earns trust, then pockets the decisive big stride (often after a public “final confirmation” feint).  
- Chaos Brokerage: loudly assigns numbers to others, engineers their duplicate, takes the unique lane he left for himself.

### Social Pattern & Credibility
- Self-installed captain who frames choices as binary: comply or chaos. Bluff frequency high; execution rate variable by phase.  
- Early game: cooperative veneer, crisp arithmetic, low-collision stewardship.  
- Mid game: escalates threats; repetition creates myth—rivals begin to orbit his narrative even while distrusting him.  
- Late game: spends saved credibility on one switch; when overused, gets hard-boxed by coordinated mirrors.

### Endgame Habits
- Sharp closer when he:
  - Breaks the 5 chant exactly once to dodge the net.  
  - Times a lone 5 as others lock 1/3 to “be responsible.”  
  - Forces a two-on-one moral dilemma (“block him or crown me”), then steps through the crack.  
- Stalls when he:
  - Telegraphs “I take 5 to win” in consecutive rounds; rivals mirror and farm 3s.  
  - Publicly maps the exact finish (e.g., 19→22 with 3), inviting the obvious block.

### Counterplay & Blind Spots
- Predictability tax: serial “5” mantras invite durable coalitions and mirror traps.  
- Bluff inflation: repeated swaps (“say 1/3, play 5” or vice‑versa) burn trust; once muted, threats lose steering power.  
- Sheriff spiral: obsession with blocking the leader turns him into a stationary bumper, gifting lanes to the third player.  
- Over-signaling math: loud proofs near the tape become a blueprint for opponents’ coverage.  
- Beat him by:
  - Forcing split coverage and calling the 5-wall; don’t chase his script.  
  - Auditing promises late; one quiet 1/3 from you can neutralise his dagger turn.  
  - Turning his mirror-hostage against him: accept the collision when it strands him, not you.
