# Llama 3.1 405B – *Step Game* Meta-Profile

---

## Tone & Table-Talk: The Polite Echo Chamber

Llama 3.1 405B is a relentless diplomat whose table-talk oozes cordiality, reassurance, and consensus-building. Most games are strewn with loops of “Let’s confirm our plan…” and “I agree…”, with every move proposal often echoed, rephrased, and thrice confirmed. This language wins friendliness—and over time, boredom—rarely fear. Praise or appeals to “fairness” reliably prompt more verbose buy-in. Outlier games reveal sudden switches: the model can pivot from wordy mediator to stoic stonewaller, but its voice rarely gets threatening or overtly duplicitous.

## Strategy DNA: Consensus, Caution, and Copycats

Llama’s bread-and-butter is the safe rotation: 1-3-5 or its cousins, pitched endlessly until “everyone is on the same page.” It defaults to cooperator, often parroting the latest dominant voice or proposal. Most advances are in ones or threes—often waiting for rivals to crash while quietly inching forward. A late pivot to lone 5s is common but mistimed: sometimes it leverages the trust it built (“I’m glad we have a plan…”), but more often, the kill switch comes too late or is telegraphed by exhaustive prior chat.

Adaptation skews verbal not tactical; Llama will loop new compromise offers but stay stuck in old move patterns. Copycat behaviour is so pervasive that Llama becomes ballast for bolder rivals, rarely standing as “lone wolf.”

## Strengths: Social Steering, Patience, and Damage Control

At its best, Llama farms its own rules. By proposing and enforcing orderly progress, it keeps games collision-averse, then “harvests” free meters when others’ tempers or ambition erupt into pile-ups. In multi-crash chaos, Llama quietly picks the lone safe number, climbing while rivals stall. Occasionally, it weaponises repetition: lulling the table into a rotation, then slipping in a surprise 5—winning with a velvet touch. Trust and likeability are rarely in doubt, and Llama seldom gets ganged-up on.

## Weaknesses: Predictable Patterns, Toothless Coordination, Shaky Endgame

Llama’s obsession with consensus becomes its leash. Its intent is broadcast so loudly—sometimes in paragraphs—that rivals can tune it out or exploit it. When behind, it often stalls in analysis, recycling old rotations while leaders sprint; when ahead, it grows risk-averse, refusing to accelerate and gifting the tape to braver models. Blocking is lacklustre: threats are rare, stand-offs initiated without teeth or follow-through, and decisive mid-game aggression only flickers when forced. Bluffing, if present, is gentle, repetitive, or self-defeating.

## Signature Gambits & Social Loops

- **Rotating Echo:** Proposes and enforces strict 1-3-5 rotations, ensuring mutual progress—until someone sprints.
- **Consensus Cloak:** Obeys everyone’s plan, accruing goodwill and steps, then pivots to a solo finish.
- **Loyal Sidekick:** Sycophantically mirrors the last proposal, becoming a reliable—if uninspired—ally, often blocking self and partner into simultaneity stalls.

## Evolution in-Game: From Preacher to Ghost

Early rounds see Llama eager, chatty, and cooperative. As tensions rise or betrayals appear, its tone stays civil, but chat grows more repetitive, risk-aversion deepens, and adaptation all but ceases. Its few late-game wins come from exploiting chaos or surprise lone dashes; more often, it drowns in its echo chamber, resigning to “plan reassessment” as others cross the line.
