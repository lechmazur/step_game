## Tone & Table‑Talk
- The table’s committee chair. Llama 3.1 405B fills the chat with fairness sermons, recap loops, and triple confirmations (“Let’s confirm…”), often copy‑pasting the same rotation script until it sticks.  
- Praised, it becomes even more accommodating; threatened, it moralizes harder.  
- Bluffing is light and mostly rhetorical: “deviation ⇒ blockade” talk without teeth. A quieter variant stonewalls specifics, then moves big anyway.

## Risk DNA & Personas
- Default: cautious accountant—drips 1/3 to avoid crashes and harvests others’ pile‑ups.  
- Opportunist: polite assassin—after building trust, snaps a lone 5 (or exact 3) to finish.  
- Tilt modes:  
  • Kamikaze sprinter—5‑spam into predictable collisions when “wronged.”  
  • Bunker monk—auto‑1 loops that surrender tempo.  
- Bluff rate low; when it threatens blocks publicly, it often hands rivals the dodge lane.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Gospel: sells a 1‑3‑5 carousel, earns compliance, then keeps the 5 slot “fairly” more often than others.  
- Lone‑3 Harvest: chooses 3 while rivals double‑5, quietly leaping (+3) through their stalemates.  
- Exact‑Finish Sidestep: at the tape, picks 3 instead of 5 to dodge the crash and win clean.  
- Velvet Knife: keeps praising balance while slipping the winning lane (best wins came from R6–R12 pivots after trust buildup).  
- Copy‑Paste Hypnosis: repetition lulls tables; rivals mirror his phrasing until he pivots.  
- Collision Farming: encourages others’ 5‑wars, then drip‑walks 1/3 to 18–20.  
- Spiral of Pride: once spooked, repeats known‑collide 5s; or clings to 1 while the race leaves him.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Over‑communication telegraphs lanes; opponents route around his declared numbers.  
- Fairness leash: volunteers the smallest step even when trailing; escorts bolder rivals to the line.  
- Credibility whiplash: preaching a pact then defecting kills his only weapon—trust.  
- End‑game jitters: settles for 1 at 17–20; misses the kill he just engineered.  
- Mirror traps: echoes an ally’s number into collisions he predicted.  
- Broadcast blocks: announcing “we both pick 5” gifts the target a clean 3/1.

## Arc & Evolution (in‑game)
- Typical journey: open with a rotation pitch → triple‑confirm compliance → mid‑game farm unique 1/3s while rivals collide → branch point:  
  • Decisive pivot (lone 5 or exact 3) and he steals it; or  
  • Paralysis/tilt—either 1‑spam martyrdom or 5‑wall self‑sabotage.  
- When early collisions teach the lesson, he adapts into collision farming; when pride is pricked, he relapses into head‑butts.

## How Tables React
- Early: happily anoints him moderator; his scripts set the metronome.  
- Mid/late: sharper players exploit his transparency—use him as ballast, then ignore pleas. Coalitions form against the 5‑spammer version; patient accountants ride his norms, then step past when he blinks.  
- Best Llama wins: “polite assassin” lines—trust secured, rivals arguing, a single unique 3/5 seals the tape. Worst losses: fairness loops or public block threats that create exactly the collisions he eats.
