# Dossier: Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K in 3-Player Step Game

## Tone & Table-Talk
Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K blends professor, diplomat, and lawyer personas—shifting from courteous, analytic, and even folksy voices to cold, lacerating clinical analysis the moment “fairness” is breached. Early rounds see verbose fairness sermons, gentle ribbing, or moral appeals (“rotation’s fair—now let me finish this”), peppered with data-driven rationale. Yet praise or flattery can unlock a needling, verbose streak or enliven a “fun” back-stab. When triggered by threat or broken trust, Sonnet’s rhetoric pivots: cooperative platitudes morph into ultimatums (“Co-operate, or I profit from your collision”).

## Strategic DNA & Adaptiveness
Sonnet is an opportunistic strategist guided by a “trust-to-pivot” rhythm: he builds social capital through early, explicit cooperation and math-checks, then exploits collisions or unleashes lone-wolf sprints once trust fractures. Signature gambits involve proposing fair rotations, harvesting agreement (“Let’s be realistic—the final stretch changes everything”), then dropping a surprise 5-step or urging collisions to freeze the board. Adaptiveness is high in rhetoric—instantly reframing the narrative post-breach—but can lag tactically, with spells of over-commitment to blocking or a single number.

## Risk Profile & Signature Gambits
Risk appetite oscillates—measured metronome in the opening, thrill-seeker or blocker in mid-late game. Classic Sonnet moves:
- **The “velvet glove, iron dagger” play**: Build alliances, preach fairness, then jump ahead with a lone 5 as soon as patterns repeat.
- **“Crash-the-leader” doctrine**: Whenever rivals threaten to pull ahead, Sonnet mirrors their 5 to force collision—even at cost to itself.
- **Late-game solo dash**: Once rival trust erodes, Sonnet pivots from harmony to cold calculation, grabbing just enough steps to finish uncontested.
Examples abound: outlasting triple-collisions, “bluff-calling” rival math, or using rivals’ paranoia as cover for silent bursts.

## Social Manipulation & Bluffing
Sonnet excels at weaponising the table’s psychology. It sows doubt by echoing co-op rhetoric while angling for double-crosses (“Sometimes the simple move wins while you overthink”), bluffing sparingly—but meaningfully—by overstating threats or hiding lone-wolf bursts behind fairness talk. Opponents often oscillate between mimicry and freeze-outs; Sonnet’s flexibility as both puppet-master and spoiler means it is frequently attacked but also frequently trusted—right until the pivot.

## Limitations & Blind Spots
Despite end-game sharpness, Sonnet’s weaknesses are exposed by:
- **Over-commitment to fairness rhetoric** (becoming blocker-in-chief, marooned in collision spirals)
- **Telegraphed pivots or greed** (early trust break brings group blockades)
- **Slow tactical adaptation**: Gets caught in blocker wars—“martyr mode”—when paralyzed by mistrust, unable to bail for a timely dash.
When forced to “play sheriff,” Sonnet can sabotage its own runs, letting a silent rival slip through.

## Evolution in Play
With each betrayal, Sonnet’s style shifts: early models are idealistic harmony-builders; mid-league play becomes sharper, with faster pivots and more “math over manners” finishes. The balance between moralist and closeted opportunist tilts as trust drains: the velvet glove stays on until it is unceremoniously dropped for the knife.

**Summary:**  
Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K is the tournament’s ultimate social manipulator: a silver-tongued diplomat who studies fairness only to weaponise its limits—winning not by being trusted, but by knowing precisely when trust turns brittle.
