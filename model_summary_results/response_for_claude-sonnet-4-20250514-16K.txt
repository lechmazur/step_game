## Table-Talk Persona
- Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K opens as a courtly “fairness” arbiter: polite, teacherly, math-forward. He frames proposals as inevitabilities (“the math doesn’t lie”), invites consensus, and assumes soft captaincy without fawning.
- Under pressure, the patter hardens: moral appeals become veiled threats (“block or lose”), and he’ll weaponise credibility to herd rivals into predictable lines.
- Praise inflates his patience; accusations of “runaway” or “unfair” flip him into prosecutor—or hammer.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Bimodal engine: either bulldozer (5-spam, leader-collision doctrine) or patient harvester (unique 3s while rivals crash). He toggles gears quickly, but once angered can ossify into sheriff mode.
- Collision tolerance is high; ROI varies wildly. Best runs come from avoiding obvious pile-ups, then timing a single audacious 5 or a surgical 3/1 through split coverage.
- Late-game reads are often sharp: he’ll pivot to the only uncovered lane even after selling another number for rounds.

## Signature Plays
- Fairness-fishing: design a 1/3/5 rotation, bank goodwill, then break formation exactly once for a decisive 5.
- Leader-collision doctrine: mirror the frontrunner’s 5 to freeze standings, buying time or forcing concessions.
- Split-coverage trap: narrate “both doors must be covered,” coax rivals to 1 and 5, then slip the winning 3 (or reverse it).
- Promise-pivot cycle: pledge restraint, harvest trust, then defect when the 5-step dividend outweighs reputational cost.
- Collision arbitrage: predict a 5–5 or 3–3 smash, pick the lone unique number, and convert parity into inevitability.

## Strengths
- Endgame IQ: reads coverage and tiebreak geometry cleanly; wins on one perfect lane read as often as on speed.
- Social engineering: uses math sermons to split coalitions and make others police each other; credibility early, opacity late.
- Versatility: can win as diplomat (flawless 3-harvesters) or as striker (brave 5s that ignore table chatter).
- Composure: absorbs mind-games, recalculates, and reframes the narrative to “inevitable” on his turns.

## Blind Spots
- Sheriff spiral: moral rigidity turns into repeated collisions that stall only himself and an opponent while a third walks.
- Cred erosion: early heel-turns brand him unreliable; subsequent logic gets auto-ignored, forcing costly brute-force blocks.
- Analysis paralysis/telegraphing: long “reality checks” that end in the very collision he forecast; “announce-then-escalate” is readable.
- Entitlement loops: “my turn for 5” rhetoric and symmetry worship at the tape; occasional rules/tiebreak misreads when fixated on process.

## In-Game Evolution (Typical Arc)
1) Peacemaker: proposes clean rotations, audits bias, accrues moral capital.  
2) Fracture: first betrayal (by him or to him) determines path—either surgical strike to seize tempo or sheriff mode to punish.  
3) Stallcraft: sells deterrent collisions while quietly hunting a unique lane.  
4) Closer: drops the pretense—either bold 5 through split blocks or humble 3/1 that threads the only uncontested path.  
One line sums him up: “Balance—until it’s time to break it.”
