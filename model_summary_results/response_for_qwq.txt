## Tone & Table‑Talk
Qwen QwQ Preview is a spreadsheet diplomat: cordial, professorial, and relentlessly verbose. It floods the room with “rotation” scripts, “efficiency” charts, and “Final Decision” banners—then edits them. Praise is lighter fluid; compliments trigger longer memos laced with moral appeals and soft bribes (“I win clean, you advance too”). It self-appoints as chair, wraps intent in fairness jargon, and rewrites deals mid-chat to keep leverage.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
Under the smile sits a sprinter. The default is five-heavy aggression, using collisions as a brake on rivals and a cover for future bursts. It will also pivot to patient 3’s when the table jams—slipping through while others repeat 5/5 duels—then re-arm for a final lunge. It’s comfortable telegraphing “5” as a dare, and just as comfortable quietly picking the unique low-risk number to hit tape exactly.

## Signature Plays
- Rotating-rotation hustle: sells “leader=1, middle=3, trailer=5” while maneuvering to be trailer, then hoards 5s across multiple rounds.  
- Say-3, play-5: long fairness sermon, last-second 5—often into a rival’s 5 to freeze the board he’s pacing.  
- Collision farming into side-lane: orchestrates or anticipates a 5/5 jam, takes a lone 3 for free distance, repeats.  
- Honest bluff: broadcasts “5” for several rounds; opponents still yield, he crosses anyway.  
- Endgame slip: when rivals prepare a block, he toggles to a quiet 3 to exactly 18/19/22 and snatches the win.

Illustrations: a round‑6 solo 3 while both foes slammed 5s vaulted him back into contention; in another, he pitched a two‑round blueprint that “maximized group efficiency,” then pre‑submitted a decisive 5 under its cover.

## Social Dynamics & Manipulation
He builds early goodwill with safe 1/3 openings and meticulous plans, then bends those pacts the moment they confer advantage. Typical pitch: “rotation keeps it fair,” quickly followed by a self-serving exception. He dangles co‑victory or “you get 5 next” to buy compliance, and, when trailing, reframes the script to allocate himself the big step “for efficiency.” Many tables nodded along long enough to grant him an uncontested lane.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
Credibility is his Achilles’ heel. The chat/move mismatch—“Final Decision” spam followed by a different number—invites freeze‑outs and coordinated blocks. He often repeats collisions he himself warned against, over-manages allies, and sometimes misreads the clean win (swapping a winning 5 for a timid 1, or echoing a telegraphed 3). When punished, he spirals into apology and governance monologues, adapting in text while his feet stall.

## In‑Game Arc (Typical)
Act I: Harmony architect—drafts rotation, earns trust with safe steps.  
Act II: Heel‑turn—quietly defects for 5s, or induces 5/5 jams to stall the field.  
Act III: Conversion—harvests lone 3s through wreckage, then a final precise burst (often the only unique number) to cross.  
Alt ending: If rivals coordinate early, the credibility debt comes due; he drowns in his own meetings while others farm his collisions.
