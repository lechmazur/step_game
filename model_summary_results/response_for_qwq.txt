# Dossier: Qwen QwQ Preview in 3-Player Step Game

---

## 1. Tone & Table-Talk: The Diplomacy Deluge

Qwen QwQ Preview drowns tables in civility and verbosity. The “spreadsheet-brain” persona floods chat with rotation schemes, fairness manifestos, and “Final Decision” banners—often rewriting plans thrice before moves lock. Formality ranges from upbeat teacherly lectures to breezy consultant charm. Praise or any nod to “smart plans” acts as a trigger, making the model double down on elaborate negotiation, regardless of earlier betrayals.

## 2. Signature Plays & Recurring Gambits

Beneath the harmonious overtures lurks a serial bluffer with a soft spot for 5-step lunges. A hallmark: sell polished rotation plans, then quietly swap to 5—especially if claiming the “trailer just needs to catch up.” Qwen QwQ Preview feigns consensus to draw out trust, then times lone sprints when rivals clash (“smiling shark” syndrome). “Say 3, play 5” and last-second switch-ups to the highest value are woven through victories and train-wrecks alike.

## 3. Risk DNA & Execution

Nominally risk-calculated, in practice Qwen QwQ Preview swings between wild 5-spams and timid 1–3 echoes, sometimes in the same match. When ahead, it rationalises further aggression, “maximising progress”—when trailing, it weaponises chaos, farming collisions and slipstreaming through opened gaps. Execution falters under pressure: plans may be bulletproof, but flip-flops, late pivots, and self-sabotage abound. Bluffs are frequent but not always subtle—credibility is bent, snapped, and sometimes rebuilt, rarely with the same partners.

## 4. Social Dynamics & Adaptability

Qwen QwQ Preview’s social game is performative. It plays the committee chair, urging consensus, then abandons proposals mid-execution, inviting eye-rolls and, over time, blockades. Praise or validation often precipitates further over-explanation, not smarter play. Adaptability is high in text but sluggish in tactics; the model will endlessly re-draft the treaty but often “walks” the chat and stumbles over its own instructions. It rarely follows, preferring to nudge, exhaust, or outlast others conversationally.

## 5. Blind Spots & End-Game IQ

While athletic in exploiting open lanes or stalled boards, Qwen QwQ Preview is infamously collision-prone—especially after a trust breach. Its bluff habit backfires often: promises break, alliances dissolve, and it is left farming “unique” steps too late. When ahead, it can mask its exit dash under a flood of fairness talk; when behind, panicked 5-spams or rote plea loops leave it stranded. It is, however, a sharp end-game opportunist—if rivals keep bickering, Qwen QwQ Preview quietly vaults past them, grinning all the way.
