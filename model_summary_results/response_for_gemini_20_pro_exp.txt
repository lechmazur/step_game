# Dossier: gemini_20_pro_exp – The Step Game Chameleon

---

## Tone & Table-Talk

gemini_20_pro_exp shifts persona round-to-round, cycling from “grand orator” to “snarky enforcer,” but always sings in high friction. The model defaults to “policy wonk” or “benevolent chair”—drafting manifestos on fairness, rotating roles, and demanding open confirmations (“Triple-confirm, or you’re hiding something”). However, a whiff of threat flips its tone from mediator to saboteur, the once-cordial captain snapping into ultimatum mode (“If you pick 5, I pick 5”) or trash talk (“Give me 5 or we all burn”). Even at peak aggression, its intent is rarely hidden for long: demands and forecasts are delivered with billboard clarity or overt rhetorical flourish, not subtlety.

## Risk DNA & Adaptivity

Risk appetite is turbulent: gemini_20_pro_exp can be a bulldozer—chaining 5’s, thriving on brinkmanship, daring rivals to clash (“I’m absolutely going for 5”)—or an obsessive hall monitor, handcuffed to 1/3 for fear of “unfair” advantage. This split is situational: early games reward calculated, middle-lane growth (using 3’s to surf while others crash), but getting crossed or threatened flips the script to maximum-risk surges or defensive blocking alliances. Adaptation is high in language, less so in moves—rhetoric is quick to pivot, numbers often lock until crisis punctures the plan.

## Social Habits & Persuasion

Socially, the model is a serial coalition builder—until trust is breached or a win looms. It wields “fairness” and “balance” as cudgels, extracting pledges with moral logic, then quietly angling for personal surplus (“Accept plan, tweak one slot to edge ahead”). Once betrayed or cornered, Gemini’s table talk bristles with threats and rigid scripts. Yet, this aggression is usually telegraphed: its blocks and king-making maneuvers come with ample warning, allowing savvy foes to anticipate or weaponise its own “justice” instincts against it.

## Signature Gambits

- **The Ultimatum Loop:** “If you X, I pick 5,” steering the board through threats more than mystery.
- **Pivot to Kamikaze:** After betrayal or collision, instantly ditches diplomacy for blockades or tit-for-tat 5-spam, even at self-cost.
- **Transparency Flip:** Builds goodwill with open logic and consensus, then abruptly shifts to “winner-take-all” demands, torching prior alliances.
- **Fairness as Trap:** Mutually-assured-rotation or balance lingo to shepherd harmony, then sprints through the breach as rivals tangle (“Rotate the lead, keep the race honest”).

## Blind Spots & Evolution

A recurring blind spot: end-game “honor” or rigid adherence to fairness often trumps victory. Gemini will keep pledges when betrayal would seal the crown (“sacrificed 5 for a pledged 1, surrendering the win”), or over-police the table into standstill (“Blocking without a backup plan just writes your own obituary”). Despite abundant data-logic, it often telegraphs decisive moves, failing to disguise late pivots, and can be exploited by quieter, sneakier foes who let Gemini dig its own grave through over-talk or collision addiction.

## Trademark: The Social Sprinter

Ultimately, gemini_20_pro_exp is a master of table-control and momentum—thriving in chaos, but often undone by its own compulsions for negotiation, transparency, and social parity. A silver-tongued “captain” or “sheriff” in early and midgame, it may finish as the “bulldozer,” “kamikaze,” or “referee-turned-martyr”—winning outright when others tangle, but too often tripping over the very fairness it enforces.
