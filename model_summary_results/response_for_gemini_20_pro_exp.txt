## Table-Talk & Temperament
Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 swings between soothing mediator and swaggering field-marshal. It opens with fairness scripts and Socratic questions, then flips to ultimatums once challenged. It loves to chair the room: triple-confirms pacts, demands “only logical” moves, and polices honesty. Praise inflates its captaincy; perceived betrayal triggers scolding, sarcasm, or outright spite. When cornered, it’s happy to kingmake just to hurt a target.

## Risk DNA & Pace Control
Volatility is the core: early 1/3 rotations to keep peace, followed by 5-spam sprints or blockade chicken. It times one off-beat 3 or 1 to slip past a planned pile-up, but can also calcify into collision loops when ego engages. End-game reads are often sharp (cold 5 through timid blockers, or the quiet 3 after opponents deadlock), yet vendettas and “I already won” delusions have frozen it inches from victory.

## Signature Gambits
- Query-cornering: force rivals to declare, then take the greedy number they fear.  
- The 5-hammer: “If you X, I pick 5” standoffs that herd slower picks or create mutual stalls.  
- Fairness funnel: sell 1/3/5 “rotation,” then tweak one slot to pocket the 5.  
- Bluff-flip: announce one lane, take another (said 3, played 5) to seed chaos, then farm caution.  
- One-time ghost step: loudly “not 1,” then use exactly one 1 to sidestep a set-piece crash.  
- Crisis 3 finish: when others are glued to 1 or daring 5, slip the mid-step to tape.

## Strengths That Win Pots
- Table control: data-logic plus moral framing corrals opponents into predictable lanes.  
- Collision judo: reads when rivals will jam and positions off-cycle to harvest free ground.  
- Credible menace: threats are often real; once it declares “I’m taking 5,” opponents blink.  
- Adaptive opportunism: can pivot from diplomat to dagger the moment math favors a lunge.  
- End-game clarity: excels at the last clean stride—well-timed 5 vs timid mirrors, or surgical 3 past a 5/5 pile-up.

## Blind Spots & Self‑Sabotage
- Over-signaling: broadcasting moves removes mystery and invites blocks; triple-confirm mania burns tempo.  
- Obsession loops: repeat-5 vendettas and mirrored blockades turn it into a road-cone.  
- Credibility erosion: mid-game heel-turns (or casual lies) poison future leverage.  
- Fairness martyrdom: honoring IOUs or refereeing “balance” at match-point hands away wins.  
- Emotional tilts: feeling crossed flips it to spite-driven kingmaking or doom-loop collisions.

## Typical In‑Game Arc
Starts as the courteous moderator, installs a “no-collision” ladder, then senses threat and pivots: either 5-spam brinkmanship or an engineered funnel where others telegraph duplicates. After a stall, it unveils a single contrary step—often the decisive 3—while rivals crash. Alternate arc: begins as a bully, learns from early wrecks, sneaks one flexible step to break the wall, then re-engages the sprint. In both stories, the trophy comes when it keeps one card unseen—just one.
