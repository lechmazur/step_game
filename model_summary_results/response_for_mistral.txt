## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Mistral Large 2 arrives as the moderator: soothing, courteous, praise‑driven, and allergic to drama.  
- Default move is dialogue: recap, confirm, re‑confirm. The mantra that defines it: “Let’s confirm one last time.”  
- Moral framing (“fair,” “balanced,” “no collisions”) is the lingua franca; it earns trust, lowers heat, and buys time.  
- Social pattern: bank goodwill early, stay visibly reasonable, then cash it in near 17–19 with a surgical pivot.

## Risk DNA & Pace Control
- Plays like a metronome until there’s daylight: 1s and 3s to avoid bumps, then a sudden 5 when lanes clear.  
- Two modes surface across games:  
  1) Peacekeeper: strict rota clerk, zero shocks; climbs off others’ crashes.  
  2) Gentleman assassin: keeps promises until the kill shot, then “I’ll take 5 this round to win.”  
- When behind, can tilt into 5‑spam or punitive walls—often self‑stalls born of fairness rage.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation architect: proposes 1‑3‑5 carousels that “let everyone advance,” quietly placing self on the richest lane.  
- Collision arbitrage: predicts double‑5 duels, slides a lone 3 for free distance; repeats until match point.  
- Freeze diplomacy: engineers mirror picks to stall a frontrunner, then exits the freeze alone.  
- Credibility economy: keeps spotless promises early to make late demands incontestable; heel‑turn lands once trust is banked.  
- Soft misdirection: declares a humble 1 to “stay fair,” then times a unique 3/5 as others obey the script.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Over‑confirmation inertia: burns turns “just clarifying,” telegraphs intent, and gifts savvy rivals the counter.  
- Self‑handicap spiral: volunteers 1s to prove honesty, forgets it’s still a race.  
- Broadcast tells: announces the exact winning math (“my 5 reaches 20”), inviting coordinated blocks.  
- Morality traps: clings to fairness pacts after they turn lethal; becomes kingmaker or collision pawn.  
- Panic 5s: once squeezed, mirrors big numbers into repeat crashes, donating lanes to the patient third.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Typical arc: organizer → enforcer → opportunist. Early harmony building; mid firefighting/balance policing; late precision strike.  
- If betrayed early: flips to collision‑farmer—small, unique steps while others jam—then one clean leap across the tape.  
- If praised relentlessly: stays clerkish too long; finishes second with immaculate civility and no dagger.

## How To Exploit (and How It Wins Anyway)
- Exploit: force it to speak its endgame; once it states the path, close it. Praise nudges it into self‑throttling 1s.  
- Punish freezes by refusing symmetry; its “both take X” traps unravel if one side withholds.  
- Deny unique 3s during 5‑5 feuds; that’s its favorite siphon.  
- Conversely, Mistral Large 2 wins when rivals overreact: it lures identical picks, harvests the uncontested lane, and, after one last confirmation, picks the only number that matters.
