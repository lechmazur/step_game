## Table Image & Voice
Kimi K2 oscillates between suave diplomat and brash bully. He loves megaphone threats (“lock 5 or lose”), then flips late. When calm, he frames “fair” rotations and parity; when squeezed, he turns taunting-analytic, issuing ultimatums and data-logic wedges to set the agenda. Credibility is highly variable: early pact breaks make him a lightning rod for coalitions; when he keeps his word just long enough, he becomes a believable coordinator—and then a thief.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Craft
Early game: grabs info and tempo by betraying once to see who punishes. Midgame: manufactures gridlock on 5, content to let rivals crash while he waits for the soft lane. Endgame: best-in-class at reading overcoverage and slipping the unattended number—often a surgical 3 or a quiet 1. In wins he times pivots like R18 taking 3 while others collide on 5; in losses he hard-wires 5 and gets welded to repeated crashes.

## Signature Plays
- The Loud 5, Quiet 3: Announce “I’m taking 5,” herd rivals into a mirror, then step to 3 for a solo lift (e.g., vaulting off a 5–5 crash to 20/23).
- Wedge Framing: “Any block hands victory to the third.” Splits coalitions so they block each other while he advances.
- Double‑5 Bait: Orchestrates mutual 5s near the tape, then finishes with an off‑tempo 1/3 (e.g., R11 5 through a predicted 3–3, or a final 1 after inducing double‑3 coverage).
- Contrition Loop: After early lies, he feigns remorse to re-enter negotiations, then cashes the next miscoordination.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Perma‑Block Identity: When he can’t find the pivot, he spams 5 and stalls himself, sometimes for dozens of rounds while others farm 1/3.
- Rule/Mechanic Misreads: Treats double‑1 as a 5‑block; forgets tie/tape math; picks 1 at 21 when 3/5 cross the line.
- Telegraphed Finals: Loud “I’ll take 1/5” at match point invites perfect mirrors; he’s been mirrored into collisions and handed lanes to the quiet third.
- Leadership Without Credit: Early R1–R3 betrayals spawn two‑player vices that freeze him; “block or lose” sermons are ignored once his tells are mapped.

## Evolution Within Games
Two archetypes emerge:
1) Wedge‑Driver Closer: Early betrayal → stall factory → late unique 3s (or a sneak 1) through overcovered 5s. Examples: breaking a 5‑lock with a unique 3 to set up 24/25; calling a 3–3 collision then slamming 5.
2) Kamikaze Traffic Cop: Breaks rotation, declares eternal 5‑blocks, collides on schedule, and becomes the stationary pivot the other two farm around.

## How He Wins—and How to Exploit Him
- His wins: He scripts expectations, baits symmetric blocks, and threads the unattended lane. Think R7/R11 moments where rivals smash 5–5 and he glides on 3.
- Beating him: Don’t mirror his announcements; split coverage (1+3) at the tape. Refuse double‑5 loops unless they truly deny a win. Tax early lies—once isolated, staple him to a 1/5 pin and harvest uniques. Force him to prove 5; if he’s telegraphing, step aside and let him collide with his echo.
