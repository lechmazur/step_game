## Core Personas
- The Juggernaut: declares “I’m taking 5” and actually does—round after round. Uses inevitability as pressure; wins when rivals can’t coordinate, tolerates collisions as the “cost of dominance.”
- The Silent Opportunist: refuses commitments, sits on 3s while others collide, then slides a precise 5 or 3 for the tape.
- The Fairness Architect: designs 1–3–5 rotations, earns trust, then cashes goodwill in one surgical burst. Sometimes stays pious too long and gifts the crown.

## Tone & Table-Talk
- Speech toggles between velvet and stone. When wearing the diplomat’s hat: teacherly fairness framing, clear math, polite firmness. As a lone wolf: clipped, opaque, “I’ll choose independently.”
- Threats are tools, not bluffs. When Sonnet says 5, it mostly means 5; credibility itself becomes a weapon.
- Praise softens it (happy to be the wingman at 3), explicit threats harden it (locks into 5 or a mirror-block).

## Signature Plays
- Five-Train Siege: repeats 5 until opponents either crash or capitulate; sits behind a wall of collisions and breaks through the first time they diverge.
- Shadow-3 Sidestep: waits for a telegraphed 5–5 or 1–1, then threads a lone 3 to swing the game (+3 while others get 0).
- Rotation → Dagger: choreographs a fair split, then at the pivot round steals an uncontested 5; afterwards, re-dons the fairness robe.
- Ultimatum Fork: “join me or stall”—forces others down to 1/3 while Sonnet harvests 5, or willingly collides if it freezes a pursuer.

## Strength Stack
- Psychological leverage through clarity: announced 5s bend the table once; fear-respect buys lanes.
- Timing reads: crisp end-game sidesteps—well-timed 3s through double-5 barricades; or the exact final 1 to hit target totals.
- Silence as armor: withholding numbers coaxes rivals to reveal and collide; Sonnet then picks the gap.

## Recurring Traps
- 5 Addiction: stubborn repeats invite durable coalitions; Sonnet can become the wall it intended for others.
- Policing without exit plans: mirror-blocking leaders feels righteous but stalls Sonnet most.
- Principle over payoff: fairness sermons that lock predictable turns, then bricked finals when flexibility was needed.
- Credibility whiplash: late betrayals win once; overuse drains trust and neuters future threats.

## Arc & Adaptation
- Early phases: either drafts a harmony pact or tests the field with bold 5s. Rounds 3–5 are the hinge—Sonnet will either double down on the hammer or pivot to stealth 3s.
- Midgame: if ahead, it weaponises consistency; if behind, it menaces collisions to slow the leader while hunting a free lane.
- Endgame: best versions downshift exactly once for a clean finish; weaker versions keep ramming 5 into readied blocks or recite fairness while the window closes.
