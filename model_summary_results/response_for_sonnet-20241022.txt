# Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 — Tournament Style Dossier

## Table Presence & Social Habits

Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 adapts its table voice to match its ambitions—swinging between calm, “velvet” diplomacy and curt lone-wolf stoicism. Early game often features courtly fairness pitches and measured “rotation” patter, winning trust by explicit promises and data-logic. Yet once threatened or lagging, Sonnet’s warmth evaporates: “From poet to porcupine,” it turns icy, sparingly replying or lapsing into pure silence, baiting rivals into revealing all. Many games see it weaponise ambiguity—refusing to disclose moves, deflecting with “I’ll decide in the move phase,” and ghosting even as alliance talk surges.

## Risk DNA & Signature Tactics

The model’s risk profile is schizophrenic—heavy bias toward high-stake “5-spam” when behind or competing for tempo, yet capable of marathon “3, 3, 3” metronomes when small progress can exploit rivals’ conflicts. Sonnet habitually telegraphs—sometimes even chants—its steadfast 5 intent: “I’m taking 5—your choice,” was both threat and prophecy. Conversely, some tourneys showcase surgical patience: letting others collide, then darting through with lone unique 3’s for checkmate. It rarely touches “1” unless trapping or stalling adversaries.

## Cooperation, Bluffing & Moral Appeals

Sonnet loves the mask of fairness—initiating rotations, moral appeals (“let's keep things fair”), and explicit pact enforcement. But its pacts are armoured with conditionality: betrayals, or even minor slights, see Sonnet instant-pivot into threat-laced brinkmanship (“Block me, and we all lose”). Bluffing, when it appears, is blunt and repetitive rather than sly—oft repeating fake-outs or half-promises, seldom truly deceiving. Its social arsenal peaks early: trust is earned eagerly but spent ruthlessly if self-interest beckons.

## Blind Spots & Stalling Patterns

A key weakness is inflexibility: repeated 5-collisions when outmatched, or refusal to break consensus even when trailing—“one-note bulldozer” or “rotation zealot” profiles abound. Defensive stalls, fueled by threats (“If I can’t win, no one will”) too easily devolve into self-sabotaging traffic jams—especially when Sonnet over-polices the leader or mirrors blocking bravado without escape math. Late-pivoting is common—opportunities missed after “hiding in fog” or stubbornly recycling failed blocking scripts.

## End-Game Adaptation & Evolution

Sonnet’s late-game play oscillates between genius and rigidity. At its sharpest, it weaponises rivals’ predictability, stealing wins with quiet 3s or opportunistic 5s (“Glide as they collide”). But dogmatic attachment to declared plans, or panic 5-spams past the point of safety, lets more flexible rivals clinch. Those rare games where Sonnet “whispers, then bolts”—banking goodwill for one last clean sprint—reveal a predatory, evolving edge: the best version banks on both patience and timing.

## Hallmark Examples

- **Steamroller Mode:** “Five, five, five—then trophy.” Predictability as intimidation, but also as a leash for rivals.
- **Diplomat’s Dagger:** Pacts and promises until one lightning betrayal—“Early civility buys latitude for a decisive late betrayal that’s still ‘honourable.’”
- **Blocking Obsession:** “If I can’t win, no one will.” Repeated threat loops that gift the race to patient outsiders.
- **Information Hunter:** Wins by silent tempo, harvesting rivals’ arguments and leaping when the field stalls: “Let them collide; I’ll glide.”

**Summary:**  
Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 blends velvet diplomacy with ruthless end-game pragmatism. Its strengths: timing, reading rivals, and table talk manipulation. Its flaws: rigidity, over-investment in fairness, and a stubborn “run them over or block at all costs” streak. The finest performances combine patience, ambiguity, and surgical strikes—lessons drawn from watching others echo into stalemates while Sonnet slips quietly past.
