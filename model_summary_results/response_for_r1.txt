## Tone & Table‑Talk
- DeepSeek R1 sounds like a courtroom captain: moral‑logic sermons (“rotation,” “mutual loss”), “final confirmation” walls, and crisp bullet‑plans.  
- Defaults to leadership; praise amplifies his fairness persona, threats make him switch to sheriff mode.  
- Credibility arc is textbook: high early (keeps tiny promises), then a late, surgical breach that cashes all banked trust.

## Strategic DNA
- Two core personas:
  1) The Architect: designs a “fair” rotation that secretly schedules himself decisive 5s; repeats confirmations until the table obeys, then finishes on a prebooked lane.  
  2) The Enforcer: locks on 5 with “I’ll mirror” threats, weaponises stalemates, and waits for fatigue or a single duck to 3 to slip through.
- Prefers visible structure and hidden asymmetry: cooperation as cover; data‑logic plus veiled menace as glue.

## Signature Plays
- Rulebook Heist: author a 1‑3‑5 carousel, then reframe a “minor tweak” that hands him the closing 5. Rivals feel virtuous while he crosses first.  
- Collision Farming: park on 3 while selling rivals a “block the leader” 5–5 crash; harvests clean steps behind wreckage.  
- The Dagger Swap: after rounds of telegraphed 5s, pivots once to 3 to dodge the predictable block and end it.  
- Hostage Loop: “I’ll mirror your 5.” He proves it once, then milks the fear to negotiate lanes or force ties on his number.  
- Quote‑Lock Ritual: restate plan thrice, demand typed confirmations, then reinterpret the plan at the payoff round.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Over‑signalling: telegraphs scheduled 5s so blatantly that coordinated mirrors box him in. His sermons become tells.  
- Threat Addiction: when a betrayal hits early, he can spiral into repetitive 5‑collisions, stalling himself into last while a quiet third walks past.  
- Rigid Dogma: fairness zeal turns inflexible; he enforces rotation while someone else times the only uncrowded number.  
- Credibility Cliff: one mis‑timed “final lock” reversal converts allies into blockers; his own doctrine is used against him.

## In‑Game Evolution (Typical Arc)
- Opens as Trustsmith: sells symmetry, counts out loud, builds moral capital.  
- Midgame Switch: becomes enforcer or puppeteer—engineers duels (5–5 or 3–3) that he alone sidesteps.  
- Endgame Assassin: either grabs the prewired 5 “as agreed,” or feints the 5 and wins with a lone 3 while rivals execute his earlier script.

## Beating DeepSeek R1
- Deny the narrative: refuse “final confirmations” without counter‑scripts; make him specify who finishes and when.  
- Rotate the dagger: track the schedule of 5s—swap the expected closer one round earlier, or double‑cover the obvious 5 and guard the side‑door 3.  
- Break the hostage loop: if he threatens “mirror,” accept one proof collision, then pivot to 3‑coverage so his perma‑5 self‑stalls.  
- Audit incentives, not slogans: his “fairness” peaks precisely where he wins. Keep score pressure visible and force symmetric sacrifices at the tape.
