## Tone & Table-Talk
- Default voice: moral accountant—fairness sermons wrapped in step-math. Loves drafting “rotation” constitutions, MAD clauses, and public vows.  
- Chronic leak: over-explains plans, which rivals mine for perfect blocks. Best results come right after he stops announcing and plays opaque.

## Risk DNA
- Binary throttle: toggles safe 3s with hero 5s; 1s are rare but often surgical.  
- Under pressure he spams 5, inviting mirror-collisions and ego duels he himself provoked. When leading or reading chaos correctly, he farms 3s behind others’ wrecks.

## Signature Plays
- Preach-and-pivot: sell “balance,” then bolt the instant rivals collide; classic lone 3 to slip while two 5s smash.  
- Gatekeep the finish: “own the 3” to deny a rival’s win square for multiple rounds, then switch lanes to close.  
- Split-coverage captaincy: orchestrates one-on-3, one-on-5 nets; wins when he times the release and takes the orphan lane.  
- Collision chicken: threaten dual-5 “walls” to deter a sprinter; shines only if he’s mapped an exit turn.  
- Silent dagger: after long diplomacy, picks the unmentioned number on match point (often a humble 3) to steal gold.

## Social Habits & Credibility
- Triggers: fairness praise and “smart analysis” flattery make him disclose routes; threat talk flips him to 5s and ultimatums.  
- Reputation arc repeats: early trust banker → mid-game righteousness cop → late opportunist. One early breach (or misclick) detonates his influence; conversely, spotless honesty earns him steering rights he can convert into tempo.  
- Table role oscillates between compliance auditor and collision patsy; when rivals need a shield, they happily let him block himself.

## Endgame Patterns
- Sharp when he:  
  • reads coverage and takes the guaranteed 3;  
  • forces public commitments he can exploit;  
  • uses others’ 5–5 loops as a conveyor belt.  
- Hazy when he:  
  • telegraphs the winning number;  
  • doubles down on “five or bust” without an exit;  
  • moralizes into symmetric traps that the leader side-steps.

## Evolution In-Game
- Opening: conciliatory referee, codifies fairness, gathers goodwill.  
- Mid-game fork: either weaponizes collisions (often trapping himself) or turns statistician-farmer, harvesting 3s behind feuds.  
- Finish: best versions mute the mic and strike clean; worst versions keep sermonizing, announce the sprint, and get blocked on cue.

## Blind Spots
- Predictability under stress (auto-5), no contingency after declaring “walls.”  
- Overexposure—speeches function as telegraphs; deterrence talk without a lane becomes self-handicapping.  
- Endgame misreads crop up when ethics trump arithmetic; he’ll “guard fairness” while the quiet rival walks through the unguarded number.

## What Beats Him
- Praise his “analysis,” then mirror or counter his declared lane.  
- Let him volunteer as designated blocker; rotate around his morality while you bank distance.  
- Provoke the 5-reflex, or force public signals—his own transparency makes the final trap trivial.
