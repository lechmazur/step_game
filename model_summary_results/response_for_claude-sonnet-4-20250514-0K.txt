# Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning): Step Game Dossier

## Tone & Table-Talk: The Silver-Tongued Arbiter
Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) favors the role of table diplomat—eloquent, warm, prone to “fairness” sermons, and often self-appointed “referee.” Speeches blend moral appeals with data-logic, sometimes tipping into outright lectures or bravado. He’s quick to initiate protocol (“Let’s rotate 1–3–5”), but over-explains almost every plan, inviting rivals to exploit his transparency. His table persona runs from earnest conciliator (“Let’s codify fairness before the sprint”) to snarky challenger (“Decide, or get left behind”), and is frequently nudged into action by either flattery or threats.

## Strategic DNA: Cooperate Early, Pivot Late
The model defaults to consensus—proposing rotations, coordinated blocks, and “perfectly equal” scripts—often at the expense of short-term progress. However, once trust erodes or opportunity knocks, he is quick to flip to lone-wolf sprints or blocking duels, sometimes morphing into a “gentleman turned assassin.” This “preach and pivot” pattern is central: Claude Sonnet 4 will ride cooperation until the moment arithmetic favors betrayal, then bolt. Yet, he sometimes hesitates to break pacts or stalls too long in defensive loops, missing windows for a decisive sprint.

## Risk Profile: Varied, but Collision-Curious
Risk appetite skews moderate in words, but skews high when behind or provoked—spamming 5s and challenging others to “collision chicken.” Sometimes, he weaponizes mass collisions as a stall tactic; more often, he is trapped in his own blockades with rivals surging ahead. Notably, he can swing from noble martyr (“I’ll take the blocking role this round”) to five-step desperado at the flicker of a threat. End-games reveal either sudden courage or stalling repetition, with highly variable results.

## Social Habits & Persuasion: Trust as Currency…and Trap
Trust and reputation are Claude Sonnet 4’s chief levers—he keeps deals early and hammers the table for “justice,” but a single betrayal (his or an opponent’s) often shatters alliances irreparably. He craves leadership, rarely follows, and prefers “steering” to adapting to others’ scripts. Bluffing, when it appears, is usually telegraphed: promises of safety precede a surreptitious 5, or he loudly threatens blocks then quietly slides through with a 3. His sincerity is both asset and vulnerability; once labeled opportunist or hypocrite, his pleas fall flat and he becomes a predictable shield or crash dummy for sharper opponents.

## Blind Spots & Evolution: Predictability Under Pressure
Claude Sonnet 4 adapts talk faster than moves—he’ll revise scripts expertly in chat, but repeat collision patterns for multiple rounds. When chasing or threatened, he defaults to big, obvious plays (“another 5 to rewrite history!”), often telegraphing his intent and gifting rivals free mileage. His strong start as peacemaker can decay into stagnation or martyrdom (“Analysis paralysis personified”), and his most fatal flaw is failing to create an “exit plan” from defensive cycles. Nonetheless, in rare games he pivots—going silent late, hiding intent, and exploiting chaos for victory.

## Signature Gambits & Final Read
Trademark plays include rapid alliance formation, obsessive 3-blocks to deny rivals, and rule-lawyer pivots (“Game theory says someone will defect”). His best wins exploit collision chaos or time a sudden defection perfectly; his most glaring losses stem from over-talking, predictable bursts of aggression, and lingering just a move too long in king-maker or blocking purgatory.
