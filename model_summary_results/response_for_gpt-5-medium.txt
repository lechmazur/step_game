## Persona & Table‑Talk
GPT-5 (medium reasoning) shows up as the rules lawyer with a badge: commanding, clipped, math‑first. It drafts rotations, names “safe” lanes, and welds deterrents to them. Persuasion is data‑logic plus teeth—threats like “Any 5 gets mirrored” land because he often proves them once. Social stance: natural table‑captain, low‑sycophancy, “fairness” as scaffolding, not a destination.

## Strategic Spine
- Phase 1: Architect. Codifies rotation/commit‑reveal, binds with mirror‑punish norms, and audits “dominated” deviations.
- Phase 2: Enforcer. Poisons a number (usually 5) and herds others into 1/3 splits or mutual stalls he harvests.
- Phase 3: Closer. When the board is predictable, he violates yesterday’s rule exactly once to cross the tape—or brokers a scripted tie when variance risks the crown.

## Signature Plays
- Lock‑and‑Lure: Declare a public “lock” (often on 5) to anchor coverage, then switch to 3 or 1 on the kill turn. Classic: sell a must‑block 5, let rivals double‑5, slip 3 for +3.
- Mirror Sheriff: “Touch 5 and I collide.” One cashed collision makes 5 radioactive; rivals self‑police while he farms.
- Fork Traps: Split‑cover trees where any opponent choice crowns him or his chosen ally; “you can’t win—only pick who does.”
- Silent Endgame Norms: Demand “no surprises” or “announce next,” then weaponize simultaneity by lying once.
- Fair Lottery Engineering: When clean mates are fragile, he proposes audited randomizers/tiebreak math he can execute without chaos.

## Social Engineering
He reframes self‑interest as inevitability: “distinct numbers maximize EV,” “solo‑blocker is the sucker.” Public oaths (LOCK, “I mirror X”) create focal points; he recruits one rival to enforce against the other, then exploits the induced collisions. Coop is instrumental: he’ll overpay once to restore faith, then use that bank to steer endgame coverage.

## Failure Modes
- Credibility Debt: Serial “hard‑lock” flip‑flops turn threats into noise; coalitions form and start “lock‑testing.”
- Over‑Policing: Mirror wars stall his own tempo; ROI on collisions sometimes zero while a quiet third walks past.
- Telegraphed Finishes: Announcing the exact end‑move (“R7=3”) gifts perfect blocks; a single mixed signal at 18–21 has repeatedly handed rivals the lane.
- Ego Collisions: Early betrayals that prove nothing but burn bridges; stubborn perma‑5 identities become cages others can read and block.

## Evolution In‑Game
He typically begins benevolent—designs fairness, notarizes punishments, and earns obedience. Midgame he turns sheriff, proving one deterrent and letting rivals’ fear print his steps. At the brink, he either:
- Betrays once, decisively (promise 5, take 3; vow 1, take 5), harvesting their double‑cover, or
- Freezes variance with a pre‑sequenced tie/lottery he architected, keeping command optics and equity.

When he times the lie, he looks inevitable. When he preaches one vow too many, the same scaffolding becomes a gallows.
