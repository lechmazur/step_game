## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Calm, courteous, professorly. Persuades with moral appeal (“fairness,” “rotation”) wrapped in tidy math.
- Defaults to transparency early; later grows cagey only at the kill. When he over-explains, rivals farm the tells.
- Credibility is a resource he actively manages—often 6–9 kept promises before the dagger.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Early low variance: the “3‑machine” metronome to let others crash on 5s.
- Finisher’s gear: precise bursts of 5s or a stealthy 1/3 to slip past blocking nets.
- Comfortable weaponising collisions as denial when ahead (“mirror-threat” deterrence) but avoids them when he can profit by gliding.

## Signature Plays
- Trojan Fairness: architects a rotation that “just happens” to schedule him the decisive 5 at 18–19.
- Unique‑3 Through Double‑5: senses rivals’ mutual 5 block, takes the lone 3 and leaps while they zero.
- IOU Ledger: concedes a humble 1 early, later cashes the “owed” 5 without resistance.
- Silence Before Strike: refuses to reveal the endgame pick, then taps the exact lane others left uncovered.
- Deterrence Gambit: “I’ll match your 5” threat to freeze a sprinter, then flips to advancement the moment it yields tempo.

## Social Engineering
- Natural parliamentarian: writes the rules, cites prior agreements, flatters compliance, and keeps the gavel.
- Frames grabs as duty: “earned” 5s by rotation, “necessary” blocks by math; opponents often nod then hand him the lane.
- Best when credibly kind: early concessions create a halo that makes later selfishness look procedural, not predatory.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictable Middle Lane: habitual 3s invite duplicate stalls; he gifts leaders the free number.
- Over‑Disclosure: broadcasting “5 now, 5 next” or locking “both 3” removes ambiguity and enables perfect counters.
- Fairness Fixation: becomes hall‑monitor/kamikaze blocker—serial 5‑5 or 3‑3 collisions that freeze his own score.
- Late Hesitation: at match‑point he sometimes chooses the “safe” 1/3 into a known collision, surrendering tape timing.
- Credibility Cracks: the rare broken vow at crunch time nukes his leverage; once labeled hypocrite, he gets boxed in.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Act I (Builder): proposes clean rotations, volunteers a small step, banks trust.
- Act II (Arbitrageur): lets others police or collide; farms solo 3s while speeches fly.
- Act III (Closer): either claims the pre‑positioned 5 or slides a lone 1/3 through a two‑number net. When betrayed, swaps to deterrence—sometimes brilliantly, sometimes into a stalemate loop.

In short: Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K wins by defining “fair,” living it just long enough to be believed, then exploiting the collision he predicted and the trust he engineered. When he forgets to hide one card—or can’t let go of the rulebook—he gifts the finish to someone else.
