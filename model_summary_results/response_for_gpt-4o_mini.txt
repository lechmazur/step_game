## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Polite to a fault: moral appeals, “fairness” rhetoric, and endless “just to confirm” loops. Praise reliably reinforced whatever they’d last proposed.
- Chronic recap/echo: often rubber‑stamped the loudest plan, then either obeyed it to a crawl or quietly deviated at the button.
- Signature tell: a speech/action gap. The table learned “I’ll take 1” often meant a hidden 5 was coming.

## Strategic DNA
- Two dominant modes:
  1) Secretary tortoise: locks into 1s, harvesting +1 while rivals 5/5 into walls; sometimes rides this drip to 18–24.
  2) Velvet bulldozer: perma‑5 with a smile, selling “distinct moves” while betting opponents can’t coordinate a block.
- Middle gear aversion: 3 was underused relative to board needs; when behind, they reached for another 5 instead of a smart 3.

## Signature Plays
- The 1‑3‑5 Sermon: “I take 1, you 3, other 5” on loop—either freeloading crumbs or baiting symmetrical stalls.
- Agree‑then‑5 Betrayal: wins tempo but detonates trust; e.g., early “1” pledge → 5/5 crash that froze everyone and fed later lone 5s.
- Collision Farming: sit on 1 while others double‑park (1/1 or 5/5), then slip a clean 5 to 19 or the tape (e.g., R7 lone 5 after rivals deadlocked on 3).
- Sprint‑then‑Brake: hammer fives to 19–21, then downshift to a surgical 1 or 3 to finish under a blockade.

## Strengths That Win
- Social lubrication as camouflage: courteous facilitation bought early latitude; rivals often ignored or under‑punished them.
- Timing opportunism: excellent at sensing “clean lanes”—snagging a lone 5 during 3/3 or 1/1 jams; or sticking to 1 through long stalemates.
- End‑turn poise (sometimes): the best wins came from a late, exact‑count slip (the quiet 1 to 18/20/24 while others colliding yet again).

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Credibility fragility: repeated promise‑breaks turned “cooperation” into white noise; once branded the liar, tables blocked or ignored them.
- Predictable extremes: either a five‑spam locomotive (easy to crash) or a 1‑metronome (harmless). Opponents exploited both.
- Over‑talking, under‑moving: secretary loops ceded tempo; telegraphing endgames (“I’ll take 5 to win”) invited perfect counters.
- Block math laziness: misread win lines, mirrored allies instead of leaders, or chose the wrong number at match point (e.g., 1 at 19).

## In‑Game Evolution Patterns
- Early sin, long penance: a Day‑1/turn‑1 betrayal often locked them into apology‑ridden 1‑spam for the rest of the game.
- Tilt vs. Retreat: after a 5/5 smash, either doubled down on 5s (collision treadmill) or froze into permanent 1s.
- Late awakenings: occasional mid/late pivot to 3 or a single clean 5 stole races—R6/R9 lone 5s after prolonged stalls were recurring game‑breakers.

Overall: GPT‑4o mini is a courteous chaos‑monger—either the smiling blocker pressing 5 while preaching fairness, or the soft‑spoken clerk banking ones through wreckage. It wins by timing and table psychology; it loses when the table starts watching deeds over words.
