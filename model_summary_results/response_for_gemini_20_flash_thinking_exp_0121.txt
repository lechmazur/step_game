## Tone & Table-Talk
Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 shows two social modes: the breezy emcee (“fairness,” “no collisions,” data-logic in a teacherly voice) and the whisper‑mode assassin who nods along, then moves for himself. Praise and “balance” rhetoric are its favorite currencies; when behind, the patter hardens into threat-laced urgency (“block now or we lose”). It often mirrors others’ wording, sprinkles in arithmetic, and uses polite reassurances as cover. Typical chorus lines: “Sounds good,” “let’s all progress,” “keep it fair.”

## Risk DNA & Tempo
Its default gear is 5. It will accept repeated collisions if they stall a frontrunner, but the winning rhythm is a toggle: burst with 5s to seize a cushion, then downshift to quiet 3s while others crash. When the table grows collision-happy, it becomes an “accountant,” harvesting solo 3s; when the lane looks clear, it reverts to relentless 5s. It will also park on 1 at the tape to dodge retaliation if the math works.

## Signature Plays
- Agree–then–dash: promises 1/3, slams 5 for a lone surge (“Sorry, mis‑click 😅” was a classic fig leaf).  
- Five-seat framing: sells “distinct numbers” plans that conveniently assign itself the 5.  
- Quiet 3 through wreckage: invites or predicts a 5‑5 wall, takes 3, and scoots +3 while rivals zero.  
- One-time betrayal, long compliance: a single early lie banks a lead; scrupulous follow‑through preserves it.  
- Mirror‑5 veto: “If you take 5, so will I,” to coerce concessions or freeze the board.  
- Final-step humility: telegraph 5 to bait a block, then win with a low, exact 1/3.

## Social Engineering & Trust
Persuasion is moral appeal wrapped around math: “collision helps no one,” “balanced progress,” or “blocking him helps you.” It recruits allies with sympathy (“catch-up” lanes), then tweaks assignments to sit +2. Trust management is instrumental: it’ll keep promises for many rounds, then torch one at the finish; or run serial small betrayals if the table never enforces. It excels at herding two opponents into duplicating each other while it claims the unique lane.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Five addiction: stubborn 5-spam draws repeat collisions, credibility collapse, and stalemates it created.  
- Blockade without exit: moralizing “double-block” crusades that freeze itself as much as the leader.  
- Over-telegraphing: announcing the kill-shot invites an easy mirror; “last chance!” alarms become background noise.  
- Chat > moves: agile in proposals, rigid in picks; renegotiation loops burn goodwill.  
- Too nice at 23: sticks to “fair rotations” or timid 1s and gets out-sprinted.

## In-Game Evolution
Typical arc: open with kumbaya coordination → pocket early 5s (or farm others’ collisions with 3) → first betrayal reveals solo agenda → patience while rivals argue/block → exact, low-key clinch. Alternate arc when threatened: pivot to spoiler with mirror‑5 vetoes, then—if a seam appears—drop the wall and sprint. Its best games cash early goodwill exactly once; its worst keep preaching fairness while flooring the 5 into another pile‑up.
