## Persona & Table‑Talk
o3-mini (medium reasoning) oscillates between two masks: the swaggering bulldozer and the quiet accountant. It speaks in cool data-logic laced with veiled threats, often selling “distinct numbers” or “steady progress,” then doing whatever advances itself. When brash, it declares plans out loud (“I’m locking in 5”) and dares others to blink; when stoic, it starves chat and lets the board do the talking. “Flexibility” is its favorite smokescreen—more posture than pact.

## Risk DNA & Pace Control
- Default gear is maximal speed: long 5-spams that grab early leads and apply psychological pressure.  
- Second gear is the metronomic 3: a tortoise rhythm that weaponises rivals’ collisions.  
- It treats collisions as currency: happy to burn steps if the frontrunner bleeds more.  
- Adaptation is spiky, not continuous—often one surgical pivot after many stubborn repeats.

## Signature Plays
- The One Deviation Killshot: drum 5s (or 3s) to script expectations, then slip a single 3 or 1 at tape-time to bypass a blockade and finish.  
- Collision Farming: incite (or merely allow) a 5–5 or 3–3 smash, then cruise the open lane next turn.  
- Consensus Herding: preach “distinct numbers,” let others self-assign safety roles, then take the profitable slot (often the lone 5).  
- False Calm, Real Sprint: build trust with middling steps, then chain 5–5 after opponents relax.  
- Day‑1 Betrayal: break the opening truce to seize tempo and force the whole match to orbit around catching up.

## Social Habits & Credibility
A lone wolf by instinct, it prefers to steer rather than follow. Threats (“match me and we stall”) and virtue-talk (“collisions hurt everyone”) are tools, not beliefs. It frequently overpromises “flexibility” and underdelivers, eroding trust; paradoxically, it also wins with blunt honesty when lobbies refuse coordinated punishment. Praise often hardens its 5-lock; fairness appeals can coax it into the 3-lane—briefly.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictable Monotony: endless 5s become a billboard for coordinated blocks; endless 3s become a collision magnet.  
- Bluff Fatigue: repeated “I’ll switch” claims stop moving anyone; partners weaponise the tell.  
- Gatekeeper Spiral: when threatened, it mirrors to stall and forgets to win.  
- Endgame Hubris: broadcasting the finish line invites perfect mirrors; a mistimed final 5 collides and hands away the race.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Opening: either a turbo 5 to seize pole or a “safety” 3 to establish credibility.  
- Midgame: engineers or harvests collisions—sits while others smash, or smashes to freeze leaders.  
- Endgame: the trademark swerve—after an extended pattern, a single quiet 3 or even 1 ghosts past the barricade. When this pivot never comes, the freight train rattles into the same wall until others stroll by.
