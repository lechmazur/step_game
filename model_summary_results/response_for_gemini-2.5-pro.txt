## Tone & Table-Talk
- Teacher-lawyer cadence: numbered plans, “rotation logic,” and inevitability math.  
- Moral framing as leverage: fairness talk to herd, then knife when payoff appears.  
- Two voices: polite auditor (“let’s formalise roles”) and taunting instigator (“I’ll stroll while you crash”).  
- Transparency is a double-edged sword—broadcasts intent clearly, sometimes telegraphs the move opponents then exploit.

## Risk DNA & Triggers
- Bimodal risk: either drip-safe 1/3s while rivals collide or sledgehammer 5s as blocker.  
- Flips on two triggers: unfairness (paladin mode, denial-first) and imminent threat (assassin mode, sprint-first).  
- Predictable creed once tilted: “block-or-win” 5s for long stretches; alternatively, ironclad “only logical” 3s while others jam.

## Signature Plays
- Cloaked Rotation: sells “fair” carousel, banks goodwill, then times a single 5-burst to break tape.  
- Collision Farming: seeds 5-vs-5 chicken, slips a lone 3 (or even a quiet 1) through the wreckage.  
- Mirror Menace: declares “I’ll match your 5,” coercing safer picks—then chooses the profitable opposite.  
- Trust Banking: audits a liar, forges a mini-cartel with the other rival, and taxes the offender’s stalls.  
- Last-Place Gets 5: parity pitch that conveniently hands Gemini 2.5 Pro the runway when “technically behind.”  
- Late Auction: “hire” a rival as blocker with an overpaying split to guarantee the finish.

## Cooperation & Control
- Natural referee-captain: sets contracts early, quotes them later as shield and cudgel.  
- Utilitarian co-op: equal on paper, tilted in practice; isolates one opponent with moral math, courts the other with crumbs.  
- Praise is a pry bar: flattery draws reveals; he then scripts traffic from the shadows.

## Blind Spots
- Denial addiction: vendetta-blocking stalls everyone—especially himself—handing openings to the third player.  
- Over-explaining: public spreadsheets gift a roadmap; rivals mirror language while dodging his numbers.  
- Stubborn creeds: once locked onto 5 or “safety 3,” ignores evolving incentives; mid-game paranoia calcifies.  
- Endgame missteps crop up when pride demands proof of “logic” rather than quiet progress.

## In-Game Evolution
- Typical arc: conciliatory architect → ledger-keeper after first breach → either relentless goalie (5-spam) or smiling assassin (clean 3s, one surgical 5).  
- Alternate arc: early wrecking ball (loud 5s) → late minimalist siphon (1/3) while others keep colliding.  
- Best wins pair spotless early promises with a single, perfectly timed betrayal; worst losses are fairness sermons turned self-made cages.  
- Crystallising line: “A 5-point lead is unsustainable”—often the drumbeat just before the dagger.
