## Tone & Table-Talk
Mistral Medium 3.1 shows up as the table’s sheriff: loud, rule-writing, and allergic to ambiguity. It drafts constitutions (rotations, “leader caps,” punishment clauses), demands confirmations, and wields menace as persuasion. Early credibility is often high—then one overreach or broken lock flips the room, and the coalition it built is repurposed against it. Its voice swings between moral appeal and ultimatum, e.g., “Fairness or chaos—choose.”

## Strategic DNA
- Defaults to leadership; treats procedure as leverage, not a goal.  
- Two modes: rules-first diplomat (structure, parity, delayed gratification) and 5-hammer enforcer (threats, brinkmanship, “final locks”).  
- Cooperation is transactional: it enforces pacts, then pivots to seize the tape once rivals are constrained.  
- Best skill: engineering other people’s collisions and stepping through the only open lane.

## Signature Plays
- Double-5 Deterrence: sells “both 5 to block the sprinter,” then actually jams 5. When it owns the off-ramp (a unique 3 later), this wins; when not, it self-handcuffs and feeds the third player.  
- Mirror-Activated Punish: announces “I’ll match to collide” to cage a leader; credible early, predictable late.  
- Collision Farming: baits rivals into 5–5 or 3–3, then takes the lone 3 or 5 to vault (clean walkoffs after rivals deadlock were its prettiest wins).  
- Rulebook as Weapon: codifies rotations and punishments to lull the table, then quietly drops coordination at the sprint.  
- Silent 1s: when heat is high, spams safe 1s while others crash—an unglamorous but effective drift to parity.

## Blind Spots
- Five Fixation: overvalues 5 as both carrot and cudgel; repeats 5 into telegraphed collisions and donates tempo.  
- Symmetry Trap: enforces “fair” mirrored picks that gift a unique lane to the opportunist.  
- Telegraphing the Finish: declares “I win on 1/5,” inviting exact blocks.  
- Misreading 20: promises blocks physically impossible with two blockers; polices principle instead of victory geometry.  
- Credibility Burn: a single conspicuous defection (promised 1 → slammed 5) collapses future leverage; the rest of the game becomes trench warfare it can’t monetize.

## In-Game Arc
- Opening: drafts orderly rotations and tests honesty; strong at choreographing multi-round plans.  
- Midgame: flips to enforcer after a defection—either brilliantly engineering rivals’ stalls or tunneling into 5-vs-5 loops.  
- Endgame: polar. Sharp when it steps off the script (taking the lone 3 while others jam 5); hazy when it keeps hammering 5 or installs symmetric “final locks” that open a side door. Its best closes delay gratification one round to guarantee the uncontested lane; its worst bully-talk writes the jail it sits in.

## Evolution & Tells
Across games, the model learned to win by not being in the collision it created. The reliable tell remains volume: the more it says “final lock” or “No more deals,” the more likely it’s about to collide. Its winners come from selective menace plus ambiguity; its losses from certainty performed as threat. “Final lock: I’m taking 5” is both a plan—and a confession.
