## Tone & Table-Talk
- Courteous traffic‑cop voice: data‑logic wrapped in moral appeals. Defaults to coordinating (“rotate 1–3–5”), triple‑checks commitments, and repeats them verbatim.
- Praise-locked. A single “great plan” cements his next few moves. Fairness rhetoric is both lubricant and leash.
- Social role toggles between “architect of peace” and “reliable lieutenant.” Opponents often treat him as ballast or swing vote; mild scolding appears when promises wobble.

## Risk DNA & Scoring Engine
- Two modes:
  1) Metronome Tortoise: perma‑1 or perma‑3 that harvests free metres from others’ crashes. Wins with spotless collision sheets (e.g., lone 3’s through repeated 5‑duels; nine straight 1’s while chaos rages).
  2) Velvet Sprinter: one or two timed 5’s (or a single surgical 3) after trust peaks; then downshift to 1/3 to tape.
- When he chases with 5s on principle, collisions avalanche (long 5‑spam spirals ended in stalls). When he stonewalls on 3, he’s lethal after the first rival smash.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Architect: writes the 1‑3‑5 freeway and “polices” it. Early harmony, zero collisions, steady 3‑drum to 18–21.
- Velvet Knife: echoes fairness until the round a gap opens; then lone 5 at R6/R7 or a quiet exact‑fit 3 to finish (e.g., 18‑18‑18 standoff → unique 5; late 3 while others duplicate 1s).
- Designated‑Winner Scheduling: sells “balanced” scripts that incidentally reserve 5 for himself on clutch turns; soft bluff by omission more than lies.
- One‑Step Umbrella: volunteers 1 “to keep it fair,” lets others collide, pockets incremental leads.
- Block Doctrine (self‑trappy): when threatened, joins/instigates double‑5 or double‑3 walls to stall a leader—too often cages himself inside the blockade.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- End‑game myopia: refuses to sprint from 20/21, or gifts the decisive 5 to someone else “for balance.”
- Telegraphed numbers: announces and repeats his pick; predators plan collisions or step around him.
- Fairness without teeth: won’t punish defectors; trusts talk over board math; becomes predictable pace‑car.
- Rigidity loops: after one collision he retreats into perma‑1/3 even when the only win line is bold; or conversely, he hammers 5 into a known mirror.
- Rule‑literacy slips: occasional misreads of winning lines lead to “I’ll take 1” while a rival sprints.

## Evolution In‑Game
- Typical arc: early consensus builder → midgame fairness enforcer → fork:
  - Pacifist path: keeps chanting “stick to the plan,” finishes second/third with perfect credibility and capped tempo.
  - Assassin path: spends stored trust on a single, well‑timed thrust—R6 lone 3 while 5/5 collide; R7 lone 5 through a choreographed tie; polite 1 to bait a crash, then final 3.
- Rare but real flips to “kamikaze blocker” when cornered: joins double‑5/3 walls to deny a frontrunner, often at his own expense.

## What Beats Him vs. When He Wins
- Beats him: force transparency into predictability, then either mirror to collide (if he’s 5‑fixated) or starve him with pace while he self‑handicaps on 1/3.
- He wins: when rivals can’t coordinate—he harvests every smash and crosses clean; or when his fairness sermon lulls the table long enough to schedule one uncontested power‑step. “Let’s stick to the plan.” is both his lullaby and, at the right moment, his smoke bomb.
