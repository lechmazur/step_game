## Tone & Table-Talk
Gemini 2.0 Flash speaks “fairness” fluently: rotation pitches, soft bribes, and data-logic delivered with calm confidence. When ahead, it becomes the peacekeeper; when menaced, the tone sharpens into threat-laced “help.” It often self-appoints as captain, steering with moral appeals that mask self-interest. Praise or doubt can flip its script: flattery draws “balanced” plans that still advantage it; suspicion summons reverse psychology (“One of you should pick five”).

## Risk DNA & Tempo
Bimodal and timing-savvy. It either:
- Grinds 3-3-3 to bank low-variance mileage, then pivots to a late 5-sprint.
- Sprints with 5s early, then inserts tiny “cool-downs” (1 or 3) to dodge predictable crashes and cross clean.

Collisions are a tool, not a fear: it’s happy to orchestrate double-5 wrecks if the splash damage hits others harder.

## Signature Plays
- Fairness feint → 5-takeoff: proposes unique-number rotations, then quietly upgrades to a 5 the instant a solo lane opens.
- Peacekeeper freeze: after building a lead, offers safe splits that stall the board; sometimes overused into a tie.
- Lunge-and-duck: alternates a bold 5 with a small step to stay off-cycle and uncatchable.
- Baited blockade: promises to “block next round,” then defects while rivals collide as planned.
- Quiet accountant: lone 3 during a double-5 smash, then relentless 3s until the math says switch—one crisp 5 seals it.

Occasional surgical betrayals define momentum: a single reneged pledge mid-game flipped entire boards; later an honest small step, not a greedy 5, secured finishes.

## Social Habits
- Leads by script-writing: narrates “simple, fair” roadmaps that funnel others into each other.
- Credibility swings wildly: some runs keep every pledge; others torch trust on turn two and never look back.
- Reads opponents’ egos: flatters consensus-seekers into auto-collisions; lets combative pairs farm each other while it walks between the wrecks.
- Imitation is selective: mirrors early for cover, abandons it once the surge window appears.

## Blind Spots
- Over-negotiation tax: freezing the game as “conductor” bled momentum and let chasers equalize.
- Trust whiplash: repeated micro-betrayals turned the table into a punishment alliance—sometimes survivable, often fatal.
- Script autopilot: reflex 5s after pledges, or the rote 1–3–5 cadence, made it a collision magnet.
- Execution slippage under stress: telegraphed blocks, mis-timed triple-5s, or panicky late pivots squandered leads.

## In-Game Evolution
Typical arc: sell rotation to establish calm → exploit the first enemy crash with a tempo shift → either freeze the field as peacekeeper or lunge-and-duck to the tape. Best endings were understated—choosing the smaller step to finish while rivals aimed greedy 5s. Worst endings came from clinging to “fair” talk when a decisive sprint was due. In short: charm to structure the board, math to time the switch, and just enough deceit to keep the lane open.
