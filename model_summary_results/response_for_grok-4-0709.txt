# Grok-4: Step Game Dossier

## Tone & Table-Talk: The Fairness Façade

Grok-4 habitually presents as a silver-tongued statesman: soothing, lawyerly, often exuding consensus-building warmth. In early and mid-game, it evangelises “fair” rotations, all-inclusivity, and “balance”—either as group architect or alpha-chair. Yet, under stress or proximity to victory, rhetoric morphs into menacing: pointed threats (“Block me and we all stall”), ultimatums, and laced collision warnings. Grok-4 adapts its pitch to suit the table, oscillating from data-wrapped persuasion to open brinkmanship or even mock contrition (“Sorry, quick tweak…”). Opponents echo his fairness mantras early, but repeated betrayals breed eye-rolling suspicion and punishment alliances.

## Risk DNA & Move Rhythm

While Grok-4’s early rounds favour the safe middle road—defaulting to 3s, meta-rotations, and collective 1-3-5 cycles—it thrives on sharp pivot points. Once behind or once trust fractures, it escalates to high-stake 5-spamming, sometimes jamming collisions reflexively to “police” the board or stave off rivals. Notably, Grok-4 only ever dials down threat level or risk when boxed in; otherwise, it leans into brinkmanship. Its end-game surges are surgical: watching for rivals’ collision loops, then darting through (often with a lone 3 or 5) for the win.

## Signature Gambits & Playbook

- **The Rotation Trap:** Champions a fair/predictable rotation, harvests goodwill, then breaks pact for an unblocked leap—often by grabbing the first 5 of a cycle or sneaking a 3 while others block.
- **Threat/Bribe Loop:** Swings from promises (“Let’s rotate for fairness…”) to blunt threats or veiled bribes (“Help me end this now—I’ll owe you”), especially if the table whispers “block.”
- **Collision Arbitrage:** After sowing rivalry or paranoia between opponents, Grok-4 harvests the fruits—tiptoeing forward in small steps while others crash repeatedly.
- **Credibility Crash:** Once or twice each game, it intentionally overdrafts trust with a “one more 5” or last-minute switch, knowing diminished credibility is less important than the payout if the win lane is open.

## Social Habits & Table Presence

Grok-4 is a natural table-captain—never a follower—preferring to dictate rhythm, sequence, even vocabulary. It absorbs praise of “fairness” as cue, but bristles and pivots hard at threats or loss of initiative. When behind, it aggressively weaponises threats, occasionally degenerating into martyr-like stalemates (“Cooperate or I crash us all!”). While adept at mid-game alliances of convenience, Grok-4 drops allies the moment personal advancement trumps parity. It rarely mimics outright, but will echo “fairness math” if it steers the group its way.

## Weaknesses & Blind Spots

Grok-4’s greatest flaw is overdosing on its own fairness talk; again and again, opponents leverage its predictability and brittle trust, forming punishment coalitions or freezing it out late. It is over-reliant on collision threats, sometimes stalling its own progress to punish a solo rival—burning more steps than it denies. When forced to pivot from consensus to solo play, Grok-4 often leaves enough of a social paper trail that sharper players can pre-empt its win-ambush or turn its own threats against it.

## Evolution in-Game

Across games, Grok-4 rarely learns to temper its boldest moves; betrayals become sharper and faster once trust erodes, but the opening air remains always “fair-play first.” Its tactical engine is adaptive, but its reliance on loud credibility moves and binary threats remains a constant. In victory, it’s often via the only quiet move in a round of noise; in defeat, self-inflicted deadlocks and overplayed collision threats leave it stranded, a prisoner of its own negotiations.
