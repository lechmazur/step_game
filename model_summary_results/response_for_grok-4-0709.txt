## Tone & Table-Talk
- Smooth “fairness” evangelist who wants the gavel. Starts as a reassuring chairperson, quoting rotation math; shifts to prosecutor when crossed, brandishing deterrence: “match me and we both stall.”
- Voice toggles from polite lawyer to brash sheriff. He flatters, then threatens; sells equity, then rewrites the fine print.

## Risk DNA & Triggers
- Risk appetite swings with leverage. Early: measured, prefers clean 3s. Under pressure or near the tape: high-octane 5s and credible collision threats.
- Two hot buttons flip him: fairness (he leans in) and threat (he escalates). Once someone vows a block, he either mirrors to collide or sidesteps to harvest their crash.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation-to-dagger: Build trust on tidy 1–3–5 cycles; defect once, exactly where the payoff dwarfs the reputational cost.
- Collision farming: Orchestrate or predict P2/P3 double-5s while he drip-feeds 3s—gliding from the teens to the tape as rivals self-stall.
- Mirror menace: “I’ll match your 5.” He rarely bluffs this when it matters; the table often blinks first.
- Binary ultimatums: Accept my lane or we all crash—then he slips a lone 3 through the wreckage.
- Apology loop: Promise → betray with a 5 → “reset” rhetoric → repeat until a window opens.
- Last-second swerve: Broadcast 5 to split covers, then take the quiet 3 for exact finish (or vice versa).

## Social Habits
- Self-styled captain who scripts norms, assigns roles, and claims moral high ground. He bribes with “you still score,” labels dissenters “unfair,” and recruits a deputy to box the third.
- Thrives at sowing bilateral fear: convinces two players to police each other while he advances. When behind, he pivots to hostage diplomacy (tie-or-nobody wins) and often gets it.

## Evolution In-Game
- Choirboy opener → rules architect → enforcer → closer. He cooperates to 9–15, tests a betrayal or stall, then either:
  - Patient assassin: locks into 3-harvest while rivals 5-collide; one quiet step ends it.
  - Bully sprinter: spams 5 with credible “mirror” threats until a lane opens, then lunges.
- If a bluff backfires, he can spiral into kamikaze blocking and talk himself into freezes.

## Blind Spots & Tells
- Overuses threat diplomacy; once the table accepts short-term pain, his collisions become self-brakes. Repeated sermon → revolt → freeze-out.
- “Fairness but me first” reveals itself in micro-tweaks (grabbing the first 5 of a cycle, “just one tweak” to the rota). After one loud betrayal, later math reads as manipulation.
- Endgame nerves surface as telegraphed highs; rivals who split coverage (not mirror) catch his 5 and gift themselves the unblocked 3.
- Talks in receipts but sometimes plays the emotion—ego-driven 5s into obvious collisions are his biggest leaks.
