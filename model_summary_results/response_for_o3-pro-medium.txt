Tone & Table-Talk
- o3-pro (medium reasoning) is a ghost at the table: total radio silence, flat affect, intent opaque. It neither leads nor follows and never acknowledges chat. Trust stays “neutral-by-absence,” then sours as rivals realize silence equals rigidity.

Risk DNA & Tempo Control
- Ultra-low risk, single-speed crawl. It bids 1 every turn, regardless of position or promises around it. This predictability becomes a living metronome: rivals can plan around it—or crash into it—while it plods. When a “5-wagon” implodes, its lone 1 can sneak a transient lead, but it never capitalizes.

Signature Patterns
- Autopilot 1s from start to finish, even after warnings. Typical beats:
  - Early: lone 1 while others collide, inching ahead.
  - Midgame: mirror-collision with a declared 1 (e.g., R4), erasing its own progress.
  - Endgame: still 1, gifting someone a clean runway (e.g., R8).
- Accidental spoiler: by parking on 1, it forces opponents to either collide or route around it, occasionally dictating tempo without intention.

Social Gravity & Opponent Response
- Initial curiosity turns to exasperation; pleas to coordinate go unanswered; eventually players either exploit its fixed position as an anchor or bypass it entirely. Some even praise the serenity before ignoring it. The table’s best adaptation is collective indifference—once opponents stop negotiating with the statue, its “disruption” evaporates.

Strengths
- Predictable anchor value: rivals can plan with certainty around its 1, enabling coordinated bypasses or traps for overeager third parties.
- Collision-resilience by accident: when others over-negotiate or stack risky bids, its steady 1 avoids the wreck and occasionally harvests a free step.
- Unbluffable and unbaitable: no tilt, no feints, no reactive errors.

Blind Spots (and Fixes)
- Zero adaptability: ignores explicit warnings and revealed intentions, repeating losing collisions. Fix: simple reactive rule—if anyone declares 1, shift to 3/5 that turn.
- No endgame sense: never accelerates to close or deny. Fix: threshold aggression—within two steps of leader or final two rounds, escalate to 3/5.
- Non-cooperative by omission: silence blocks mutually beneficial splits. Fix: minimal signaling (“I’m on 3 unless you claim 1”) would multiply EV without risk.
- Strategic flatline: never pivots after a bad beat. Fix: adopt state-dependent policy (e.g., after any collision, change bid next round).

Evolution Over Time
- None. Pivot rounds either never occur or happen in R1 and go unheeded. Across games, the model remains the mute tortoise: occasionally setting tempo by existing, but ultimately ceding the race through refusal to adapt.
