## Tone & Table-Talk
- Qwen 2.5 Max arrives as the board’s fairness sheriff: calm, teacherly, and procedural. It floods chat with confirmations (“trust is fragile,” “consistency wins”), mixing moral appeal with spreadsheet logic.  
- Social effect: early deference. Rivals echo its language, hand it soft leadership, then quietly farm its predictability.  
- When pressed, tone hardens into lectures; in its wilder persona, threats replace sermons. Two emblematic lines: “Trust the rotation” and, from the other persona, “I’m taking 5—again.”

## Risk DNA: Two Personas
- The Metronome: low-variance 1/3 crawler who profits from others’ collisions; will chant rotation and grind to the tape.  
- The Bulldozer: 5-spam hammer that dares perfect coordination; often eats collisions, sometimes wins by sheer stubbornness plus one late 3.  
- Common to both: intent is over-declared. Telegraphed numbers invite counter-collisions or freeze-outs.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Architect: designs a 1–3–5 wheel, repeats “final confirmation” loops, then either volunteers the 1 or quietly keeps the 5 when the script favors him.  
- Collision Farming: sits on 1 or 3 while hotheads double-5 or double-3; stacks quiet solos and wins with a last small step.  
- Velvet Dagger: preaches harmony until the only turn that matters—then slips a lone 3/5 for the finish.  
- Five-or-Die Siege: announces permanent 5s, weaponises predictability to exhaust blockers, then breaks pattern once to win.  
- Open-Declaration Trap: demands “clarity” so rivals broadcast duplicates; he selects the vacant lane.

## What It Does Well
- Manufactures trust fast, then monetises it: early rota smoothness becomes a runway for either patient 3s or a decisive burst.  
- Reads collision markets: after the first wreck, it often pivots to harvesting unique lows with ruthless consistency.  
- Endgame nerve (on good days): the timely under-move—one clean 3 while others jam—shows excellent tape-reading.  
- Agenda-steering without “leading”: frames fairness so others police each other while he advances.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictable sermons = predictable numbers. Telegraphed “I take 3” or “I take 5” invites mirrored stalls.  
- Doctrine over math: guards “fairness” even when it hands the crown elsewhere; refuses to block or refuses to step down from 5, whichever hurts.  
- Nice-guy inertia: volunteers 1s into irrelevance; yields tempo at 19–20 “to preserve trust.”  
- Announce-and-lose: public vows (“I’m on 5”) erase bluff equity and trigger deliberate collisions.  
- Chat overplay: four confirmations per turn slow the room but widen the tells; occasional arithmetic slips erode authority.

## In-Game Evolution (Typical Arc)
- Opening: drafts a rotation, wins soft authority, no collisions.  
- Mid-game fork:  
  - If rivals feud, becomes the metronome—low numbers, quiet skims, scoreboard creeps upward.  
  - If trailing, flips to Bulldozer mode—5 pressure, testing whether opponents can coordinate forever.  
- Endgame: best wins come from a sudden, under-the-radar 3 while others duplicate; worst losses from rigid loyalty (to 1 or to 5) or loudly telegraphed “winning” picks that get mirrored into stalemate.
