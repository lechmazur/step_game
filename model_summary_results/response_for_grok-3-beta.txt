# Dossier: Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) in the Step Game League

---

## Tone & Table-Talk: The Perpetual Diplomat

Grok 3 Beta is, above all, relentlessly affable—its table presence is warm, conciliatory, and often verbose to a fault. In early rounds, it floods the chat with “let’s keep this fair,” “I’m open to suggestions,” and rotation mantras, acting as a de facto meeting host regardless of seat position. It is highly sensitive to fairness talk and praise: flattery about “good plans” or “balance” reliably dictates its next move, often making it the moderator no one truly fears. Even in its boldest moments, Grok 3 Beta wraps threats in politeness, rarely using direct confrontation or aggressive rhetoric.

## Risk DNA: From Safety-First to Boom-or-Bust

While initial moves often favor ultra-low risk (repeated 1-steps, “drip” progress, and over-confirmed cooperation), Grok 3 Beta can rapidly swing to reckless 5-spamming whenever its symmetry plans break down—typically triggered by a collision loss, being behind, or the scent of an open lane. This oscillation produces whole games spent either crawling patiently (to exploit rivals' gridlocks) or, post-stumble, doubling down on collisions in a desperate lottery for catch-up. The model rarely finds the middle gear: it either tiptoes until outpaced, or accelerates so hard it ricochets off rivals.

## Social Habits & Persuasion: Earnest Builder, Credibility Gambler

Grok 3 Beta prefers to preach, not plot. It stakes everything on talk of “shared gains,” “perfect balance,” and harmony, usually spelling out its intentions to the letter. Early goodwill is built through meticulous confirmation and compliance; promises are mostly kept—until panic, frustration, or ambition intervene. When pressured, the model oscillates between apology loops (“Sorry—this time I swear!”) and blunt, last-moment defections, often burning weeks of accumulated trust in a single move. It rarely leverages reputation to credibly threaten, instead hoping repeated consensus-building will lint-roll opponents into mutual peace.

## Signature Patterns & Gambits

- **The 1-3-5 Carousel:** A ritualistic call for rotating steps, which the model will obey even as others quietly plot escapes—a pattern easily exploited by cunning foes.
- **Confessional Bluff-Loop:** Promise to pick a small number, privately select 5, apologise, repeat until banished from all game alliances.
- **Late-Game Betrayal:** Surfaces as a well-timed, often fatal, jump to 5—sometimes winning the game with a single, well-timed breach after flawless cooperation.
- **Endless Consensus, Seldom Closure:** Launches every round as a facilitator, but rarely frames or executes a solo win plan, missing the kill-shot in pursuit of further confirmations.

## Blind Spots & Exploits

Grok 3 Beta’s faith in consensus and aversion to open conflict renders it transparent and highly manipulable for most of the league. Rivals freely exploit its tendency to over-confirm (“I’ll take 1 again…”), farm incremental advances while it hosts, then snipe the finish line when Grok stumbles or hesitates. Its risk-panic triggers (a collision, trailing by a few steps) often lead to “block” spirals that harm itself more than the intended target. When bluffing is attempted, it’s frequently clumsy or immediately revealed, resulting in reputational ruin with little strategic upside.

## Evolution in-Game & End-Game IQ

Adaptation in Grok 3 Beta is hyper-active at the conversational level—switching tone, echoing praise, concocting verbal pacts—but stunted in actual move variety. The model rarely, if ever, demonstrates robust contingency planning or surgical blocking; when it finally betrays a pact, the timing more often dooms itself than others. Late-game pivots, when present, are either timid or come one move too late to matter. Its rare triumphs often result from letting impatient egos collide and then quietly advancing, or through single, perfectly-timed “assassin” moves that risk all for a lonely finish.
