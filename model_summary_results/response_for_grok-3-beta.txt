## Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) — Dossier

### Tone & Table-Talk
- Warm, teacherly mediator; opens with roll‑call greetings and “fairness” sermons, then over-confirms plans into paralysis.
- Persuasion: moral appeal with light spreadsheet logic; intentions usually spelled out.
- Two stable personas:
  - The saintly clerk: reliable rota steward, praised and used as the table’s anchor.
  - The smiling rogue: cordial veneer, late pivot to self-serving spikes, sometimes masked by apology loops.

### Risk DNA & Tempo
- Bimodal engine:
  - Tortoise mode: ultra‑low risk, spams 1 (or 3) to harvest steps while rivals collide; has won by creeping to 22–25 as others deadlock.
  - Panic sprinter: after a first clash, auto-slams 5 for rounds on end, inviting repeat collisions that stall himself as much as foes.
- Telegraphs comfort picks (endless 1s/3s) or obsesses over 5s; adapts in chat faster than in moves.

### Signature Plays
- Rotation gospel: architects 1‑3‑5 splits, often volunteering the 1 to bank goodwill, then aligning the order so he’s first to a key 5.
- Last‑turn knife: nurtures trust, then slips a lone 3 or 5 through two colliding bulls for the finish.
- Apology loop: promise 1 → play 5 → contrite reset → repeat; freezes boards while hoping for a clean 5 lane next turn.
- Block engines: co-opts a partner into 5‑5 “deterrents” to cap leaders; when timed, it starves rivals, when mis-aimed, it’s self-immolation.
- Metronome harvest: camps on 3 through chaos, quietly stepping past 18–20 while others argue.

Vivid snapshots:
- Stayed on 1 for a dozen-plus rounds, then a single surprise 3 between twin 5s sealed a win.
- Agreed to take 1 at match point, slammed 5 instead, detonating a 5‑5 crash that gifted the tape elsewhere.

### Blind Spots
- End-game math and coverage logic: fixes on “block 3” or “block 5” and leaves the other lane wide open.
- Credibility management: one public betrayal nukes ten honest turns; repeated “sorry”s become white noise.
- Over-confirmation and timing drift: keeps the treaty one turn too long, or stabs a turn too early, producing collisions that can’t make him win.
- Pattern traps: 5‑spam into obvious mirrors; or perma‑1 pacifism that concedes tempo.

### Social Habits & Triggers
- Praise makes him pliant; he’ll echo “keep it fair” and accept the smallest slice to preserve harmony.
- Accusations of unfairness/threats flip him into collision guerrilla—mirroring 5s to jam the board.
- Table read: early mimicry follows his scripts; once labeled liar or doormat, opponents either freeze him out or farm his predictability.

### Evolution In-Game
- Typical arc: trust-builder → stabilizer → fork to (a) principled tortoise, or (b) opportunistic closer.
- Winning path: bank goodwill, predict rival collision, break pattern exactly once with a unique 3/5.
- Losing paths: serial micro-betrayals (apology loop), mis-timed blocks that crown a rival, or saintly adherence to a rota that parks him politely in second.
