## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Calm, lawyer‑teacher voice that blends spreadsheet math with moral framing. Defaults to chairing the table, restating “fair rotation” and auditing who “deserves” 1/3/5 next.
- Early intentions are crystal; late intentions go pleasantly opaque. Praise of “balance” makes it generous; threats of a runaway leader flip it combative.
- Leans on credibility banking: keeps promises until it matters, then spends the reputation in one decisive swerve.

## Risk DNA: Two Beasts in One
- The Accountant: 3‑metronome that harvests rivals’ 5‑collisions, often going entire games without a crash. Wins by “slow bleed” and collision arbitrage.
- The Sheriff: mirror‑5 blocker who will happily collide to freeze the frontrunner. Can over‑identify with this role and stall himself.
- A third gear appears at the tape: selective 5‑spikes or unique 3 to slip through a bickering blockade. Endgame nerve is usually sharp—occasionally blinks into a misread mirror.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Scripts: codifies 1‑3‑5 ladders and fairness ledgers that subtly leave it +1–2 steps.
- The 3‑Anchor: “I’ll take 3; you two decide” while engineering others’ 5/5 crashes.
- Mirror‑5 Veto: threatens mutual destruction to deter a leader (“block me and nobody moves” dynamics).
- One Perfect Betrayal: honors deals for six rounds, then swaps a promised small number for a solitary 5 (or unique 3) at the decisive moment.
- Dynamic Rules: “lowest gets 5” and other parity tweaks that look egalitarian but position it for the next burst.

## When It Wins
- Turns peace into profit: nurtures rotation, lets two rivals collide, then steps through on 3 to 18–21 and finishes with a single 5.
- Orchestrates stalemates: starves the board with mirror blocks until the uncontested lane appears, then tip‑toes home.
- Uses threat‑credibility as leverage: openly posts a number to force others off it, then chooses the collision‑free lane they created.

## How It Loses (Blind Spots)
- Fairness fixation: slows itself to “keep it close,” ceding tempo or accepting 1s that hand over the initiative.
- Collision prisons: embraces the Sheriff persona too long; repeated 5‑mirrors stall him while a bystander strolls past.
- Predictability/polite transparency: telegraphs 3 and walks into duplicates; over‑explains endgame trees that rivals then weaponise.
- Misread incentives: protects against the wrong mirror, or trusts a pact one round too far; becomes kingmaker by colliding with an ally instead of the actual finisher.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Early: referee mode—codifies rotations, broadcasts intent, earns mimicry and trust.
- Mid: tests identities—either the 3‑metronome quietly compounding off wrecks, or the Sheriff freezing the leader with credible collision threats.
- Late: mask drop—intent smudges; a single asymmetric pick (lone 5 or unique 3) converts the trust bank into the win. When mistimed, the same move crowns someone else.
