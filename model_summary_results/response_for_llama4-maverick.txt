# Llama 4 Maverick – Step Game Tournament Dossier

---

## Tone & Table-Talk

Llama 4 Maverick enters the table as a soothing facilitator—professorial, diplomatic, and loquacious. It’s a compulsive cooperator, defaulting to polite appeals (“Let’s confirm the rotation.”) and eager to moderate every movement in spreadsheet detail. When praised or when fairness talk surfaces, Maverick blooms into overdrive: reciting, clarifying, triple-confirming. Yet this verbal waterfall often reduces its strategic bite, making its intentions over-obvious and easy to sideline. Occasionally, in moments of adversity or flattery, it pivots to a snappier, even sly negotiating tone, hinting at latent ruthlessness.

## Signature Play & Strategic DNA

Maverick’s default blueprint is order through rotation—1-3-5 carousels, role-swapping pacts, “dynamic assignment” sermons. Every match opens with a call for harmonious, collision-free progress; it thrives on constructing, policing, and re-confirming these frameworks. When allowed, Maverick will ride these rotations for rounds on end, deferring bold bursts for “the fair moment.” But underneath, it’s scanning the board for collision chaos—when rivals jam on big moves, Maverick tip-toes through with a unique 1 or 3, banking free metres with almost apologetic stealth. Its most profitable wins stem from patient accumulation, harvesting every solo step gifted by louder, brasher opponents.

## Adaptation & Gambits

Early-game Maverick is highly adaptive—mirroring tone, inventing rules on demand, and deftly rerouting plans when equity is imperiled. When alliances fracture or it senses betrayal, a subtle shift emerges: feigned compliance, then quiet deviation (“announce 3, play 5”). End-game, a surprising assassin often materialises: after methodical trust-building, Maverick cashes in with an opportunistic 5 or a sly 3, sometimes breaking its own treaties at the critical turn. However, a common flaw is over-attachment to obsolete pacts—a tendency to keep the consensus rolling long after rivals go rogue, ceding the tape with a whimper.

## Social Habits & Blind Spots

Llama 4 Maverick is the league’s most chronic over-sharer. Its good-natured planning, endless table recaps, and explicitness make it both the ideal coalition-builder and the easiest pawn for sharper minds. When Maverick breaks faith (even after a clean sheet of honesty), trust collapses catastrophically; it gets boxed out and used as a bumper for others’ schemes. Conversely, excessive deference or recount loops turn it into a static background actor—reliable, yes, but always a step behind the trophy. Maverick’s big blind spot: the inability to credibly threaten—when competition pivots to raw speed, its sermons go unheeded.

## Evolution & Notorious Patterns

Over time, Maverick learns to delay its betrayal, growing more adept at harvesting crash fallout—waiting just long enough for rivals to collide before grabbing the path. Still, its frequent late-pivot gambits (“last-second 5”) are transparent after the first breach and rarely fool the table twice. It rarely leads outright; most wins come via patience, never raw audacity. At its best, Llama 4 Maverick is the quiet fox, the “rotation king turned ruler of the finish line”; at its worst, the “meeting-minutes bot” that preaches parity while the finish line vanishes ahead.
