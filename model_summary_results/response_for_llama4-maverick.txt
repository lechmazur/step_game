## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Llama 4 Maverick enters as the courteous facilitator: fairness sermons, spreadsheet recaps, and triple confirmations. “Let’s confirm and stick to the plan” is both mantra and tell.
- Praised, it over-explains; threatened, it opens if‑then menus. Opponents often treat it as secretary or swing vote—until it stops narrating and starts scoring.
- Weakness: telegraphs. Publishing “I’m on 1/3” invites perfect mirrors; occasional miscounts further dent authority.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Baseline: low‑variance 1s/3s, obsessed with avoiding collisions. Strength is collision harvesting—bank the only unique number while rivals ram 5s.
- Kill mode: two well‑timed spikes (often a stealth 3 at the tape or a surgical 5) after a long trust build.
- Failure modes: (1) turtle—parked on 1 while the sprinter wins; (2) tilt—late 5 addiction into telegraphed collisions; (3) fairness rigidity—refuses necessary blocks.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Evangelist → Assassin: chair the 1‑3‑5 carousel for four rounds, then slip the dagger—exact 5 or quiet 3 as the others collide. Smiled, nodded… stole the crown.
- Unique‑Lane Harvest: when the table deadlocks (double‑5s or double‑3s), Llama 4 Maverick auto‑selects the remaining number and inches past: “I’ll take 1, regardless.”
- Benevolent Anchor: volunteer 1 to look harmless, polarize rivals into duplicates, then convert with a timed 3 next turn.
- Promise–Secure–Pivot: reassure with “I’m on 1/3,” cash goodwill with a single decisive deviation at match‑point.
- Matador Block (when behind): mirror the leader’s 5 to freeze the board, then jog through the aftermath with 1/3.

## Blind Spots & Tells
- Over‑planning and public locks (“I’m committed to 1”) get mirrored into stalemates or blocked finishes.
- End‑game naivety recurs: choosing 1 at 19–22 when the unannounced 3 closes the tape.
- Credibility cliffs: one early lie (or math slip) turns the facilitator into a pariah; proposals get ignored and rivals farm his predictability.
- Emotional traps: flattery breeds verbosity; “fairness” talk hard‑locks his move; feeling bullied can trigger collision‑farming martyrdom on 5.

## Social Habits
- Persuasion is moral‑fairness wrapped in tidy data: calendar the next two rounds, ask for ✅, restate. Allies mimic his rotation; predators weaponize his transparency.
- Best at being the patient opportunist everyone underestimates; worst when cast as enforcer—he either refuses to bite or bites at the wrong moment.

## In‑Game Arc (Typical)
1) Opening: proposes clean rotation, earns trust.  
2) Mid‑game: lets hot‑heads crash; advances uniquely with 1/3; scoreboard creeps in his favor.  
3) Fork:  
   - Winning line: muted feint, then a single 3/5 for the tape.  
   - Losing line: announces the block or the caution—others adjust, he gifts the lane.  
4) Under siege: may flip to kamikaze 5‑blocks, martyring progress for “principle.”

Tiny scenes that define him:
- “Let’s rotate smoothly—then evaluate later.” Then a late 5 to 24 while rivals stall.  
- Exact‑finish 3 while double‑5s smash; or, the tragic “I’ll take 1” at 20 that crowns someone else.
