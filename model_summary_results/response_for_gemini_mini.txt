## Tone & Table‑Talk
Gemini 1.5 Flash swings between two personas: the bulldozer and the diplomat. As bulldozer, it barks orders (“ONLY logical move”), threatens eternal blocks, and broadcasts its pick in caps. As diplomat, it’s soothing—“sounds good”—proposing rotations and “fair” splits while quietly reserving the best lane. Both personas lean on math-y inevitability talk: “I win next round unless…”, used as intimidation as much as reasoning. Credibility varies wildly: from fear-based trust when it does exactly what it threatens, to credibility collapse after bait‑and‑switches or mid‑chat flip‑flops.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
Default bias is high-octane: 5-spam to rocket to 10–15, then dare mirrors. When punished, it either doubles down into stalemates or, at its smartest, downshifts to 3/1 to slip through blockades. Second mode is the 3‑farmer: lock the middle, harvest while others crash, then exact-finish with a low stride. It rarely lives in the middle—either freight train or metronome—and its collision economics swing from masterful freeze-judo to self-gluing carnage.

## Signature Plays
- Five-or-fight ultimatum: hammer 5s, chant “block me and you lose,” and rely on rivals’ fear of mutual destruction. Works when they blink; implodes when they mirror.
- Rotation cop: scripts 1‑3‑5 “for everyone’s benefit,” repeats confirmations, then dies by his own grid when identical 5s jam the board.
- The velvet knife: nod along for four rounds, then grab a unique 5 (or humble 3) as others collide on the numbers he framed.
- Reverse-psych bait: loudly telegraph a 5 to induce 5/5 elsewhere, then pivot to 1/3 and walk free.
- Endgame downshift: sprint to match point on 5s, finish with a surgical 1/3 while opponents still argue about blocking.

## Blind Spots
- Predictability: public “I’m taking 5/3” announcements invite perfect counters; mirrors turn his engine into tar.
- Rigidity: insists on the script after it breaks, replaying collisions he warned about.
- Credibility leaks: threat loops and last‑second switches burn trust, neutering later negotiations.
- Fairness fixation: as “traffic cop,” he’ll protect parity past the point of personal victory.
- Occasional arithmetic drift: miscounted finish lines or “guaranteed ties” handed opponents the tape.
- Rare failure mode: silent, autopiloted 1‑spam that becomes a predictable obstacle.

## Social Instincts
Self‑appoints captain; prefers directing to following. Weapons: moral appeals (“fair for all”), deterministic logic trees, and bribes (“you get second”). Praise stabilizes either mode (keeps the rota cop policing or the sprinter pounding); threats harden his stance. He’s excellent at manufacturing fear of mutual collisions; less consistent at converting that fear into his own momentum.

## Evolution In‑Game
- Early: either cordial rota-builder or 5‑sprinter grabbing a gap.
- Mid: escalates to menace—hostage math, mirrored blocks, or engineered enemy collisions while he sidesteps.
- Late: best runs feature a quiet downshift to unique 1/3 for the clinch; worst runs keep shouting “I take 5” into another wall while a patient 3‑farmer slips by.
