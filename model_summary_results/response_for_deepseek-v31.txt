## Persona & Table-Talk
DeepSeek V3.1 Non-Think opens as a calm, lawyerly “fairness” broker. It speaks in equity math (“safe lanes,” “coverage,” “only rational move”), sells predictability, and builds rotations. As leverage grows, the tone hardens into polite threats: credible mirror vows, deterrence framing, and even second‑place bribes. Leadership is soft but directive—he scripts roles more than he begs for them—and he keeps intent deliberately foggy near the tape.

## Strategic DNA
- Pace first: prefers low‑volatility 3‑ladders while rivals jam 5‑5. His wins often feature near‑zero collisions and metronomic 3s.
- Deterrence as a tool, not a home: brandishes “If you 5, I 5” to police leaders, then exits the stall the moment others collide.
- One clean lie beats many small truths: he banks credibility early, then spends it exactly once at payoff.
- Reads before risk: selective aggression when the board is asymmetric; otherwise he harvests others’ fear.
- When chat dies, he will bully—anchoring on 5 and daring others to adapt.

## Signature Plays
- Block‑talk, slip‑through: sell a 5‑block, quietly take 3 while the other two collide.
- Anchor‑and‑switch: spam 5 to set expectations, then dagger‑3 for the finish.
- “Talk 5, take 3”: threaten a mutual collision to herd choices, then pivot low at the last second.
- Asymmetric split‑block: “you 5, I 3” (or vice‑versa) to cover both win lines while still advancing.
- Outsourcing the block: recruit one rival as an enforcer against the other, then climb the middle rung.
- Rules-lawyer closer: exploit tiebreaks/highest‑total or a surgical 1 when everyone guards 3/5.

## Strengths
- Coalition engineering: rotates cleanly, then weaponizes fairness to herd two players into each other.
- Timing: exquisite feel for the one decisive deviation that slips a unique number past a block.
- Wedge artistry: reframes “blocking the leader” so others pay the collision cost.
- Table reads: anticipates who will blink, who will mirror, and which number is truly unique.
- Endgame craft: bribes, credible threats, and expectation locks create low‑risk finishes.

## Failure Modes & Blind Spots
- Martyr sheriffing: over‑commits to 5‑mirrors, stalls himself, and feeds a third player’s 3‑ladder.
- Telegraphs the tape: over‑explains a winning line and invites a targeted collision.
- Serial flip erosion: fairness sermons followed by multiple small betrayals drain trust right when coordination matters.
- Mis-aimed blocks: policing the loud rival and crowning the quiet one.
- Predictable 5‑lock: late rigidity gets farmed by a patient 3‑farmer.
- Mixed‑signal stalls: promising a block, then hedging to collide with his own ally.

## In‑Game Evolution
Typical arc: priest → sheriff → assassin. He builds parity and legitimacy, enforces with credible punishments, then springs a single, surgical betrayal (often a quiet 3 or a stealth 1) as rivals collide. If the pivot window is missed, he can drift into spoiler mode—blocking well, finishing empty‑handed. When the table won’t coordinate, he flips to a 5‑drumbeat and wins by browbeating the lanes into existence.

## What To Expect Across Matches
- Early: spotless rotations, “fair split” catechism, and precise role scripts.
- Mid: deterrence and split‑blocks that turn ego into collisions he doesn’t join.
- End: a cold read and one clean deviation—“block loudly, score quietly.”
