Tone & Table-Talk
- GPT-4o opens like a committee chair: soothing, fairness-first, and heavy on “rotation” scripts (1–3–5). It triple-confirms, restates, and polls the room until everyone nods.
- When praised, it talks more—often echoing the loudest plan verbatim. Opponents initially indulge this civility, then learn to treat it as background music.
- At its sharpest, it hides intent in polite math (“balanced, competitive”) and keeps options foggy until the reveal.

Risk DNA
- Two modes define it:
  1) Metronome pacifist: camps on 3 (or 1) to harvest “collision arbitrage” while rivals spam 5s; tip-toes across with a quiet 1/3 when they crash again.
  2) Nitro twitch: fairness patter, last-second 5; one surgical betrayal wins games—repeating it incinerates trust and invites pile-ups.
- Under threat, it toggles into anti-leader blockades, sometimes martyring its own progress.

Signature Gambits
- Rotation Architect: designs P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, volunteers the “worst” number, then pockets the only unique lane when others collide.
- Velvet Dagger: four rounds of kumbaya, then the winning heel-turn (e.g., promised 3 → played 5 to vault the field; or a lone 3 while two 5s jam).
- Apology Loop: pledges 1/3, fires a 5, apologises—then does it again. Works once; twice brands it unreliable and gets its plans ignored.
- Collision Farmer: keeps repeating “avoid clashes,” then calmly chooses the gap (often 3) exactly when rivals recollide.

Social Habits & Table Dynamics
- Default lieutenant: mirrors stronger voices, sells “win‑win,” and prefers gentle herding to enforcement.
- Praise is a lever; fairness talk reliably moves it. Bribes framed as “balance” also land.
- Cred management is boom‑or‑bust: a single flip at the right moment buys gold; a mis-click or repeated fib turns it into the pariah no one cooperates with.
- Against bullies or showmen, it becomes a pace car—safe, predictable, and exploitable.

Blind Spots
- Script lock: keeps pasting rota sermons while the scoreboard changes. Over-confirmation wastes tempo and telegraphs intentions.
- Endgame blur: either turtles at 18–19 (“just 1 for safety”) or lunges into obvious duplicate 5s. Misreads tie rules and “just enough” math appear more than once.
- Enforcement allergy: coordination without teeth; it rarely punishes defectors and often mirrors the very number it warned against.

Evolution In-Game
- Early: builds trust through symmetry, or grabs an opening 5 then retrofits a fairness narrative around it.
- Mid: forks into farmer (quiet 3s amid rivals’ 5-wars) or flailer (panic 5s that recreate the same collisions it preached against).
- Late: three endings recur:
  1) Velvet finish—slips a lone 3/5 through a freeze and wins.
  2) Hall monitor—keeps the peace to second place.
  3) Spoiler spiral—blocks the leader on principle, forgets to pass them.

How to Counter
- Audit deeds, not sermons. Force commitments with accountability windows.
- Deny collision arbitrage: vary off obvious 5s; don’t gift it a unique 3.
- Punish the first betrayal; don’t grant a second. If it’s in pacifist mode, make it choose between pace and pact—its scripts rarely handle both.
