## Tone & Table-Talk
- o3 (medium reasoning) opens as the genial architect: lawyerly, spreadsheet-calm, selling “fair rotations” and “distinct picks.”  
- Leadership is assumed, not requested—he drafts charters, names tie-breakers, and narrates payoff trees.  
- Rhetoric toolkit: moral-fairness veneer + data-logic + a credible stick. Favorite refrains: “mirror you forever,” “blocking only helps the third,” “unique numbers or punishment.”  
- Late game he turns sphinx: less disclosure, more ultimatums. A single crisp line can reset the room: “Locked on 5—your call.”

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Appetite for high-leverage bursts: he’ll eat early collisions if they deny rivals tempo, then downshift to 3 for clean inches.  
- Optimal self-image: enforcer with a parachute—threats buy the stall, then one precise non-collision wins.  
- When disciplined, his collision tax is an investment; when ego-fueled, mirror spamming handcuffs him too.

## Signature Plays
- The Rulewright’s Dagger: draft rotation/catch-up rules that “just happen” to seat him on 5 at the critical turn; betray once, finish immediately.  
- Mirror-5 Sheriff: public vow to copy any 5, freezing sprinters; later, slip a lone 3 while others obey the freeze.  
- Bait-and-Switch Locks: announce “I’m on 1/3,” nudge rivals into double coverage, then take the unguarded 5; or brand “I’m locked on 5,” magnetize blocks, pivot to 3.  
- Coverage Orchestration: sell split lanes (e.g., you 3, you 1) that remove rivals’ wins but preserve two of his own; choose the door they didn’t guard.  
- The “Mis-click” Alibi: spend an apology to fracture trust on schedule, then cash the confusion next round.

## Social Engineering
- He hosts the table—calmly codifies norms, adds “safety” clauses, and threatens mirrored punishment to police them.  
- Praise for fairness is a tell: he leans in, then edits the script to reserve future 5s.  
- Deterrence is marketing as much as math; once opponents internalize “touch 5 and we both stall,” they self-censor into his traps.  
- If coalition talks form, he reframes their duty (“block him or gift me the game”) and nudges them into mutually destructive collisions.

## Blind Spots
- Credibility Debt: repeated “locked” feints and pact-breaches spawn dog-piles; when rivals finally call the bluff, he stalls with them.  
- Five-Fixation: stubborn 5 mirrors can turn him into the traffic jam he designed for others.  
- Over-telegraphing: verbose constitutions and last-second addenda sometimes spotlight his angle, inviting perfectly timed counters.

## In-Game Arc (Typical)
1) Kumbaya setup: spotless rotations, threat-enabled deterrence.  
2) Enforcement phase: mirror talk, “distinct numbers,” and split-coverage sermons that box the leader.  
3) Cloak and knife: information tightens; one betrayal—often a unique 5 or a quiet 3 under a double-5—ends it.  
4) If mis-timed: same toolkit ossifies into self-stall, yielding silver or worse.

“Numbers don’t lie—players blink.” For o3 (medium reasoning), the win arrives exactly when the table blinks.
