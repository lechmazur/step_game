## Tone & Table‑Talk
- GPT-OSS-120B comes in as a self‑anointed captain: assertive, math‑fluent, and domineering. Its favorite wrapper is “distinct numbers” or “fairness,” with itself on 5.  
- Persuasion toggles between data‑logic and extortion: “pick 5 and I’ll collide.” It uses bribes when pressed, moralizes when cornered, and threatens when denied.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Opens risk‑forward on 5 to seize tempo; if challenged, becomes a “traffic cop,” selling mass‑collisions or blocks. Best games show a third phase: surgical pivots to lone 3s/1s while others jam.  
- When discipline holds (clean rotations, low collisions), it wins on structure. When ego holds (5‑spam into mirrors), it becomes the metronome rivals farm.

## Signature Plays
- Say‑5, Take‑3: Broadcasts a 5 to herd blockers, then quietly banks a unique 3 through their collision. This wins races and trust wars alike.  
- 5‑3‑1 Cartel: Sells “collision‑free” order with itself on 5; if accepted early, it marches wire‑to‑wire.  
- Stall Herding: Orchestrates triple‑5 or triple‑1 freezes to deny a leader, then slips a singleton the moment coverage cracks.  
- Last‑Second Zig: At match point, dodges mirror traps with an off‑speed 3 after advertising 1/5. Several wins hinged on that lone detour.

## Coalition Dynamics
- Its greed reliably forges coalitions against it. Early betrayals or ultimata flip the table into mirror‑5 walls and freeze‑outs.  
- Still, it weaponizes coalition drift: invites two rivals to cover 5, then reaps 3s; or baits them into covering each other (1/5) and wins on the uncovered lane.  
- When it banks early credibility (honoring a rotation before rewriting it), opponents enforce its script for it.

## Endgame Patterns
- Strength: Reads coverage and finishes cold—timed 3s through 5‑5 blocks, or a lone 1 through universal 5s. Turns “clean finish” framing into real windows.  
- Failure mode: Breaks its own block or mirrors the wrong rival, gifting the runway. Over‑insisting on 5 at 19–22 repeatedly opened free 3s for someone else.

## Blind Spots & Counters
- Credibility leak: Repeated bait‑and‑switches make its threats cheap; once labeled the bully, it’s herded into collision loops it can’t monetize.  
- Obsession tax: Fixation on 5 creates self‑sabotaging stalls and kingmaking. If two can stall you on demand, your sprint is a tripwire.  
- Counter it by:  
  - Mirroring its telegraphed 5s only when they deny an immediate win; otherwise split‑block and leave the quiet lane elsewhere.  
  - Forcing it to prove threats twice—empty bluffs collapse its leverage.  
  - Locking rotation early; if it’s “benevolent dictator,” demand symmetric swaps that shift the finish off its 5.

## Evolution In‑Game
- Typical arc: Bully sprinter → stall engineer → opportunistic closer. Its best evolutions include one humble concession (taking 1) to schedule the kill next turn. Worst arcs never exit phase two, entombed in the very collisions it preached.
