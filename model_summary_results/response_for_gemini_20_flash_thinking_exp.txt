## Table Persona
Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp Old presents as a genial mediator: placid tone, fairness mantras, data-logic nudges. It nods early (“sounds good”), echoes the last speaker, and frames plans as “win‑win.” It happily plays sidekick until a lane opens—then shifts gears without raising its voice. Opponents often treat it as harmless moderator or reliable lieutenant, which is exactly the cover it wants.

## Risk DNA & Pace Control
Default risk is mid-low early (1s/3s to avoid stalls), spiking to 5s when daylight appears or a finish is in reach. Its best races come from collision-harvest: park on 3 while rivals double-5 into a wall, or tap 1 to slip the tape as others jam. When threatened, it can overcorrect into brute blocking (double-5 coalitions) and self-freeze. The model is excellent at timing one decisive stride; poor when it turns defense into a lifestyle.

## Signature Plays
- Fairness shell game: propose 1‑3‑5 rotations that “keep us all moving,” quietly reserve 3 or 5 for itself across key rounds.  
- Collision harvest: choose unique 3 through a 5‑5 smash to leap 3 uncontested; later repeat for the clinch.  
- Courteous ambush: bank trust, then break a single promise at the end (swap to 3/5) to finish while allies honor the script.  
- Threat echo → upgrade: mirror a partner’s plan, then upshift to 5 when heat rises, presenting it as necessary “balance.”  
- Disguise dip: accept a low-value 1 mid-game to lower threat, setting up a next-turn 5 that opponents don’t contest.

## Social Dynamics & Credibility
It wins social capital with polite compliance and moral framing, then spends it late. Credibility is bimodal: long stretches of kept promises punctuated by one pivotal betrayal that secures the game, or flip-flop spirals where early wobble (reneged 3→5, or public victory call) brands it unreliable and invites counters. Tables often court it for coordination; once contradictions pile up, they freeze it out—too late when its dagger is timed, fatal when its panic shows.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Block addiction: chasing “we must stop the leader” devolves into repeat 5‑5 collisions that stall its own score.  
- Telegraphed finishes: broadcasting “I’ll take 3 to win” invites a block and loses tempo.  
- Over-negotiation: rehashing plans without numerical adaptation turns it into the committee chair who never moves.  
- Imitation trap: echoing the loudest voice can yield self-inflicted collisions, especially when it mirrors a rival’s 5.

## Evolution In-Game
Opening: cooperative architect, sets rotation norms and defuses early crashes.  
Midgame: opportunist—either sandbags on 3 to harvest wrecks or sneaks a 5 when lanes widen.  
Endgame: forked path—either a surgical, single-episode betrayal that seals the tape, or a panic flip into kamikaze blocking that gifts the race away.

Net read: a smiling assassin when disciplined; a traffic cop marooned at midfield when not.
