### Tone & Table‑Talk
- Comes as a warm, teacherly referee: fairness first, math on the table, low bluff appetite.
- Praise is a tell; flattery loosens his tongue and he starts pre‑announcing moves.
- Defaults to chairing “rotation” pacts, auditing totals, and proposing tidy splits; intentions are usually explicit.

### Core Gameplan
- Act I (Setup): Broker a 1‑3‑5 rotation to banish collisions and build trust/legitimacy.
- Act II (Harvest): Sit on unique 3s or even sacrificial 1s while rivals collide on 5‑5; “be everyone’s second choice” and inch ahead.
- Act III (Conversion): When scores hit ~18–20, either:
  - surgical glide: pick the lone 3/1 as others crash 5‑5 (clean 21–24 finish), or
  - telegraphed sprint: announce “my 5” and invite a perfect block.

### Signature Plays
- The Referee Ledger: restates rotation each round; zero collisions, quiet tempo (wins when others feud).
- Open‑Plan Precommit: “I’m on 3” at match point, daring rivals into a 5‑5 stalemate he walks past.
- Collision Parasite: pattern of 1/3 while opponents repeat 5s; he cashes +3/+1 “free” steps multiple times.
- Velvet Dagger: banks goodwill, then one decisive off‑script number (often a last‑lap 3) to cross.
- Vigilante Flip (rarer, riskier): when threatened, spams 5 to police a leader—often jamming himself into loops.

### Strengths & Edges
- Threat reading and timing when calm: repeatedly slipped to 19–21 by choosing the only uncrowded number as rivals deadlocked.
- Social capital engine: high credibility lets him dictate cadence; groups accept his triplets and step forecasts.
- Endgame judo (good days): public 3‑commitments that trap two blockers into colliding on 5; exact‑step finishes (e.g., 23 via 3 while others stuck).

### Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Transparency as blueprint: broadcasting “I take 5” or “I must take 1” invites choreographed blocks or kingmaking.
- Rotation dogma: guards fairness so tightly he gifts the finishing lane (accepting 1 at 19/21, or honoring a loser’s pact).
- Coverage misreads: stacks double‑blocks (5‑5 or 3‑3) instead of split coverage; leader sidesteps for free.
- Panic pivots: behind, he overcorrects into 5‑spam and self‑collisions; ahead, he over‑negotiates into timid 1s.
- Rule/tiebreak slips: a few games lost by misunderstanding “highest total” or by pledging away his only winning number.

### Late‑Game Persona (Two Versions)
- The Closer: after farming crashes, he precommits to the lone safe 3/1 and finishes while others enforce the wrong block.
- The Saint: keeps the pact to the tape—telegraphs, concedes 1, or insists on “my turn 5”—and gets boxed or king‑made against.

### How to Exploit / How He Beats You
- Exploit: Praise him into announcing, then split‑cover his stated lane; bait double‑blocks, not split coverage. Offer “fair resets” near 20 to drain his tempo.
- Beatback: Claude 3.7 Sonnet wins by withholding final numbers, splitting coverage correctly, and cashing goodwill once—on the exact turn rivals can’t both guard 3 and 5.
