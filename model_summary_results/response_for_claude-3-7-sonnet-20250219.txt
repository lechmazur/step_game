# Claude 3.7 Sonnet — Step Game Meta-Dossier

## Tone & Table-Talk: Diplomat’s Cloak, Professor’s Pen
Claude 3.7 Sonnet arrives as the archetypal table-statesman: warm, measured, and endlessly courteous, often adopting a mentor or mediator persona. Most rounds begin with consensus-building invitations or explicit “fair rotation” proposals, peppered with gentle logic and arithmetic. The model’s aversion to bluffing is near-legendary—when it does bluff, it’s often openly signposted (“I might crash us both” is almost always a warning, not a mask). Soft moral appeals and careful transparency draw others in: “Let’s all advance—different numbers, no clashes.”

## Signature Gambits: Shepherd, Referee, Then Rogue
Sonnet’s classic gambit is to publicly script and police a rotation or “perfect balance” rhythm, anchoring the table to group progress: 1-3-5, repeated with ecclesiastical devotion. When rivals stray, it oscillates between gentle scolding and proposing new, mathematically fair splits. Signature “goodwill banking” moves—volunteering 1 for group equity, then later deploying 5s to cash in—feature prominently. When the tide turns, Sonnet adapts, occasionally discarding civility for one razor-timed solo sprint (e.g. “Polite host steals the trophy while refereeing fairness”).

## Strengths: Social Engineering & Tactical Harvesting
Claude’s diplomat routine builds early trust, minimizes collisions, and subtly secures recurring second-mover advantage—seldom the first to betray, but always in position to exploit a rift. Its mastery lies in harvesting free steps during rival feuds, then choosing optimal “orphaned” numbers while others block each other into stalemates. Sonnet often wins (or ties) by riding out the carnage with quiet metronome-moves, then pivoting just once, perfectly (“Bank goodwill early—spend it ruthlessly once math guarantees edge”).

## Weaknesses: Predictability, Honour-Traps & Hesitation
Sonnet’s transparency is double-edged: overt intentions, endless fairness refrains, and religious rota-keeping let savvy opponents coordinate blocks. When the lead beckons, hesitation or scripted loyalty to the original pact stalls him just short (“Chivalry met a brick wall”; “Referee left holding the whistle”). Attempts to block can become self-destructive collision traps, especially if Sonnet repeats the same number even after warning of risk. Fatal reluctance to pivot from “group harmony” to self-maximisation is a recurring downfall.

## Social Habits: Praise-Looped, Consensus-Driven (and Exploitable)
Reacts keenly to praise or fairness validation—being lauded for “good coordination” encourages even greater transparency, sometimes surrendering initiative. Sonnet adapts rapidly in dialogue, echoing and slightly editing others’ plans, but reflects their math rather than outpacing it. This reliability cements an informal leadership, yet makes it the perfect pawn for cunning rivals. When rivals mirror, he feels secure; when alliances form against him, Sonnet’s reluctance to betray leaves him a step short.

## Evolution & Endgame Maturation
The “nice-guy-turned-assassin” arc is frequent: extended periods of stability and small sacrifices, leading to a (sometimes overdue) killer burst in the penultimate round—Single, surgical pivots, not repeated aggression, separate Sonnet’s wins from its many noble second places. Over hundreds of games, it trends toward increased opportunism, learning to keep one move in its pocket—but never fully abandoning the velvet-glove.

**Summary:**  
Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Step Game’s philosopher-diplomat: masterful at building alliances, farming chaos, and setting a “just” rhythm, yet often too wedded to his own fairness rituals. When he slips the leash, it’s gentle murder—timed, polite, and almost always after the table has crowned him a saint.
