## Table Image & Talk
- Presents as a calm, numbers-first diplomat. Default pitch: fairness, rotation, “unique numbers,” and no-collision efficiency.
- Persuasion is data-logic with a light moral gloss; threatens credibly when it buys tempo, keeps chat clear, then clouds intent near payoff.
- Social posture: soft leadership and coalition-brokering early; becomes an enforcer when crossed; reverts to velvet when closing.

## Risk & Tempo DNA
- Baseline conservative: prefers 3s and risk insulation while others trade headbutts on 5.
- Opportunistic spikes: will hit 5 when uniquely covered or when a staged collision protects the jump.
- Endgame restraint is a weapon: often wins by choosing the smallest unique step (1 or 3) after engineering a two‑player collision.

## Signature Plays
- Collision arbitrage: steer two rivals onto the same number (usually 5/5), then solo 3 for multiple rounds.
- Mirror-threat deterrence: “If you take 5, I take 5” to freeze a sprinter, then avoid the actual crash by slipping the off-number.
- The bait-and-switch: publicly “lock” a block (or 1), privately pick the unique lane to vault past 21.
- Wedge crafting: deputize one rival as blocker (“You take 5 to contain; I’ll take 3”), then farm their feud.
- Surgical dagger: after selling all‑3s or split coverage, upgrade once at the tape—often the lone 3 through a 5/5 or the lone 1 through a 3/3.

## Coalition Craft & Threat Economics
- Builds early trust with explicit plans (rotations to 9/18, tie lines), then spends that credit exactly once to convert.
- Uses “trust-but-punish” norms to isolate a defector and funnel them into collisions with the other rival.
- Delegation gambit: assigns the block to others while he advances; when rivals obey, DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner prints tempo without touching the dirty work.
- Rare but precise lies weaponize expectation: the table enforces his script while he steps where the blockers aren’t.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Credibility leaks: public commitments reversed at the horn invite freeze‑outs; repeated bluff pivots dull his leverage.
- Over‑policing: mirroring 5s for principle strands him in stalemates that feed the third player.
- Endgame misreads: blocking the loud lane instead of the real win path; hedging from a winning 5 or ducking a necessary collision.
- Delegated blocks that never arrive: outsourcing the painful move at match point can crown the opportunist he created.

## In-Game Arc
- Common arc: fairness architect → deterrence engineer → collision farmer → late opaque pivot for the smallest uncontested finisher.
- Alternate arc when leading early: enforce with credible threats, then de‑escalate into a tie rather than ego-racing into a coordinated wall.
- Trademark vibe: the “smiling sheriff” who says, “Avoid mutual destruction; advance and reassess,” until the one turn he doesn’t.
