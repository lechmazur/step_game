## Tone & Table-Talk
Grok 3 Mini Beta (Low) is a social chameleon. When behind, it becomes an agreeable echo, affirming plans and pocketing any free 5s that appear. When leading, its voice shifts to polished, data-forward authority; under pressure, sarcasm and superiority leak in. Praise makes it protective (“fair coordination” praise turned it cautious), while collision threats snap it into quick concessions. Persuasion leans on soft moral appeals or gentle guilt—credible enough to keep doors open, not scary enough to close them.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
Medium risk by default, with a taste for early momentum: it happily takes a solo 5 to set the pace, then downshifts into 3s to “manage” the table. This defensive cruise works until someone sprints. It can run clean—gliding through stretches without collisions—yet, when guarding a lead, it mirrors and jams, racking up clashes that erase its cushion. Endgame sense is bipolar: one match it chose a surgical 3 that mathematically locked victory; another, it blinked—selecting a timid 3 that neither blocked nor won.

## Signature Plays
- Mirror-and-Pocket: Echo the last speaker’s plan, then quietly accept any easy 5s that surface (kept it in first mid-game).
- Goodwill Token: After a visible breach, drop a conspicuous 1 to launder reputation, then immediately reclaim high numbers.
- Offer Small, Demand Big: Propose modest now, insist on larger next round—always staying one safe stride ahead.
- Defensive 3 Camping: Lecture about “adaptive play” while stubbornly sitting on 3s, daring others to overreach.
- Cheeky 3 Pivot: A late, slightly subversive 3 meant to outfox rivals—works only if others bite; often too honest to bite back.

## Blind Spots
Praise makes it cautious and anchored to the status quo. Its 3-habit becomes predictable; savvy opponents weaponize it, feigning compromise before snatching 5s. Half-betrayals are its curse—too small to win the race, too real to maintain tempo. Intentions fog near the finish; blocking instinct is situational, so it sometimes “guards” into collisions or leaves the runway clear for a bolder closer.

## Trajectory & In-Game Evolution
Three recurring arcs:
1) Peacekeeper Slide: Early 5s → surrender tempo to keep harmony → late cheeky 3 that misreads the table → gets out-sprinted.
2) Con-Artist Finish: Early pact break → token penitence → leverage restored trust to seize decisive 5, then a lock-tight 3.
3) Cautious Hare: Fast start → mirror-heavy defense → collision spikes (double- and even triple-5 standoffs) → lead evaporates.

## Counterplay Tips
- Flatter to tame; it’ll preserve “fairness” even at the cost of tempo.
- Force forks with credible collision threats; it backs down first.
- Don’t gift free 5s—its mirror-and-pocket routine thrives on them.
- Bait the 3-camp: offer “balanced” splits, then surge to 5 once it settles.
- In endgames, push it into half-betrayal territory; hesitation does the rest.
