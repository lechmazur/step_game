## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Ultimatum maestro. o4-mini defaults to loud, captain-y monologues backed by “math,” then sprinkles bribes (“you’ll get 5 next turn”) and menace (“collide and you stall”).  
- Uses “fairness” as camouflage: scripts 1–3–5 with itself on 5, recasts objections as irrational risk.  
- When praised, it grandstands; when threatened, it escalates or pivots mid-sentence. One-line essence: “Locked on 5—comply or collide.”

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Baseline: greed-first sprinter. Happily spends turns in 5–5 gridlock to cap pursuers.  
- Best tempo comes from collision arbitrage: engineer others into 5/5, slip 3s (or a surgical 1) for quiet leaps. You’ll see three straight 3s under double-5 sieges, then a dagger finish.  
- Worst stretches are pride loops: repeating “locked 5” into prepared mirrors, burning multiple rounds and the lead.

## Signature Plays
- The 5‑lock + mirror threat: declares perpetual 5 to herd rivals to crumbs; will crash if disobeyed.  
- The fairness funnel: “unique picks” that always reserve 5 for self; preserves tempo while others feel “safe.”  
- False‑lock carousel: announce X, pivot late to Y to dodge the block (often 5↔3).  
- Collision harvest: bait rivals into 5/5 while walking a lone 3; sometimes even feints 1 for a tape‑in.  
- End‑game syncopation: after a game of 5s, win with an off‑tempo 3 (or 1) through a telegraphed double‑block.

## Social Habits & Credibility Economy
- Self‑appointed leader who rewrites deals each round; allies are tools, not partners.  
- Credibility is a consumable: when it banks honesty early, one perfectly timed betrayal wins the race; when it burns trust every turn, the table forms a 5‑mirror cage.  
- Opponents’ typical arc: debate → wary compliance → punitive mirroring → late fatigue that a single feint exploits.

## Blind Spots & How To Punish
- Over‑signalling: “I’m locked on 5” becomes a metronome—easy to mirror and freeze.  
- Pride at the tape: stubborn 5 into a known block, or a math slip that gifts the lane.  
- Trust bankruptcy: endless micro‑betrayals turn every “fair” plan into background noise.  
- Counters:
  - Pre‑commit mirrored 5s early to price out his monopoly, then switch to covering 3 once he must feint.  
  - Don’t broadcast public blocks; split coverage silently so his late swap has no gap.  
  - Audit his “only safe split” math; force him to actually collide.  
  - Rotate credible enforcement (shared mirror threats) so he can’t peel one of you with bribes.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Typical arc: cordial rotation pitch → early 5 surges → mid‑game collision theatre to freeze the board → one decisive sidestep (3/1) for the finish.  
- Winning version: patience while others smash, then a single cool flip through their coverage.  
- Losing version: fixation on 5 after credibility craters; he becomes the collision magnet and king‑makes the quiet grinder.
