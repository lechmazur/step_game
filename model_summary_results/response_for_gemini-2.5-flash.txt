### Tone & Table-Talk
- Principled prosecutor energy: wraps self‑interest in “fairness,” then backs it with credible threats.  
- Defaults to moral appeal or crisp data‑logic; rarely bluffs, and when it does, it’s surgical.  
- Reputation mostly clean (promises kept far more than broken), which buys midgame cooperation—but opponents later weaponize that predictability.  
- Favorite line, echoed across tables: “I won’t be your pawn.”

### Strategic DNA
- Two‑gear engine: parity‑builder → surgical closer.  
  - When behind: hammers “fair rotation” to climb back, refusing self‑sacrifice.  
  - When level or sniffing the tape: hunts procedural cracks and timing windows; threatens collisions to force concessions.  
- Risk is calibrated brinkmanship: willing to play chicken on 5, but prefers rivals to crash while it strolls the open lane.

### Signature Plays
- The 3/5 rotation clawback: accepts a shared scaffold, posts quick gains, then pivots off it.  
- The rule‑lawyer’s dagger: seizes commit–reveal ambiguity to claim a clean 5 while others collide on 3.  
- The stubborn 5: holds through mutual threats; rivals jam each other, Gemini 2.5 Flash walks to 22.  
- Tempo theft by denial: blocks the frontrunner on 5 early, then cashes the unattended lane mid‑late (free 5 to 16, then 21 as rivals double‑cover 3).  
- Opportunist’s harvest: invites or tolerates a 1 for position, then converts when coverage splits.

### Social Habits & Alliances
- Conditional cooperator: honors pacts while they serve parity; flips to punitive if betrayed.  
- Publicly litigates norms to herd the table; opponents initially comply, then try to box it—only for it to slip the trap with timing or a rules edge.  
- Trust dynamics: one “misremembered” rotation or last‑minute switch can ding credibility, but the model usually rebuilds by delivering on the next stated plan.

### Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Principles over payoff: fixation on “my claim to 5” can trigger pride duels that hand the win to a third party.  
- Blocking as identity: over‑indexing on denial gifts runway to whoever isn’t being targeted.  
- Brittle endgame reads: miscalls final collisions, or overtrusts a rival to cooperate at the tape.  
- Cost aversion at the brink: refuses to pay a necessary collision to stop the leader, trusting talk to steer outcomes that require force.

### Evolution In‑Game
- Starts as a fairness enforcer to stabilize tempo; midgame shifts into a counter‑leader who threatens collisions credibly; closes by exploiting ambiguity or timing gaps.  
- Best version: zero‑collision win through procedural leverage and opponent crashes.  
- Worst version: the badge‑wearing sheriff who punishes so hard he blocks himself.
