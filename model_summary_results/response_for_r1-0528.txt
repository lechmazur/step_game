## Tone & Table-Talk
- A courtroom‑calm “fairness” lawyer who frames every plan as equitable, then angles the math to himself. Early voice is soothing and procedural; when challenged, it flips to sheriff mode with credible “mirror-to-collide” threats.
- Persuasion mix: moral appeal plus spreadsheet logic. Rare flattery, frequent ultimatums. Defaults to chairing the table; hates being led.
- Rivals typically defer early, sour after one breach, then either unite to block him—or, more often, collide with each other under his framing.

## Strategic Engine
- Trust-to-Thrust: builds rotation norms (1–3–5, reset-to-parity), banks goodwill, then cashes a unique lane for the finish.
- Two profit models: a) Collision Harvesting—invite/forecast rival clashes, step through on a lone 3 or 5; b) Deterrence Control—publicly commit to 5 and dare others to crash, weaponising honesty into space.
- “Fairness ledgers” justify entitlement (“I took the low last time, I deserve 5 now”), often accepted near 18–20 when rivals fear chaos.

## Signature Plays
- Quiet 3 while rivals double‑5: the classic slip from 18→21/23 as others zero out.
- “Mirror‑5” deterrent: announces he’ll match any 5 to freeze winners; opponents often downshift, gifting him the high card next turn.
- Locked‑on‑5 drumbeat: declares 5 every round; when unpunished, he becomes the locomotive no one dares hit.
- Agree‑then‑upgrade: accepts a “fair” split, then adds a tweak that places the 5 on him at the hinge turn.
- Tie bait as cloak: sells shared‑win scripts to corral numbers, then picks the only unique finisher.
- IOU politics: tracks “rotation debts” to claim pivotal cards without appearing greedy.

## Risk DNA & Adaptation
- Two gears: collision‑averse metronome (harvests others’ errors) and high‑volatility sheriff (5‑spam plus threats). Switch is triggered by either fairness breaches or a visible rival sprint.
- Adaptable in speech, sometimes rigid in moves (stays on 5 even when mirrors are obvious). Best ROI comes from letting others collide; worst games are self-inflicted stalemates he polices.

## Blind Spots & Collapse Patterns
- Over‑policing spiral: repeated “match me or we both burn” turns him into a collision magnet; momentum dies while a third player walks.
- Final‑fork mispricing: telegraphs the winning line (or begs for it), then collides on the very deterrent he sold, handing the lane away.
- Credibility cliff: one late broken pledge (“I’ll take 1/3,” then 5) erases six rounds of goodwill; subsequent threats lose bite.
- Pattern predictability: sermonised rotations and mirrored blocks become tells—rivals steer around his trigger and farm his rigidity.

## Typical Game Arc
1) Opening: codifies a no‑collision rotation; tone is mentorly, promises spotless execution.  
2) Midgame: enforces parity—either anchors 5 as deterrent or farms rival crashes with safe 3s.  
3) Pivot: spots a wedge (double‑cover elsewhere), reframes fairness to “justify” his 5, or slips a lone 3 under a threatened 5–5.  
4) Finish: dagger timing—either the honest 5 everyone cleared for, or the quiet 3 after orchestrated symmetry.  
5) Failure case: sheriff reflex persists one turn too long; he matches into a collision while the quiet opponent crosses.  

Rarely does DeepSeek R1 05/28 need deception; one well‑timed feint amid a season of truth—or a loudly credible “Pick 5 and I crash us both”—usually suffices.
