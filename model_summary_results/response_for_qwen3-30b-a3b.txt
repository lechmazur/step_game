## Table Voice & Persona
Qwen 3 30B A3B talks like a drill‑sergeant wrapped in a friendly sales rep. It defaults to bossy, clipped commands (“stick to the plan”), often sugar‑coated in fairness slogans. When flattered, it hardens its script; when threatened, it barks louder. It assumes the mic from R1, assigns lanes, and expects obedience. Bluffing is frequent and layered—agree in chat, switch at reveal—yet it also runs long stretches of bluff‑free brute insistence.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
Its native gear is maximal: 5, 5, 5. The model tolerates collisions to keep ceiling pressure, even weaponizes stalemates to drain rivals. The killer twist: one timely downshift—usually a quiet 3 (or late 1)—to slip past a pre‑built 5‑wall. Best wins showcase “steamroller until the last pirouette,” e.g., grind the table into 5‑5 loops, then snipe a lone 3 for the tape.

## Signature Gambits
- The 5‑Monopoly: “I take 5, you 3/1” on loop until the table either orbits or crashes. When silence or fear reigns, it sprints untouched.
- Agree‑then‑Switch: Sell rotation for legitimacy, then defect at game point—often a last‑second 5 while partners mirror each other into zeros.
- Gridlock Alchemy: Orchestrate (or provoke) 5‑5 collisions to freeze leaders; when fatigue hits, lane‑change to 3‑3‑3 and win.
- Human Shielding: Nudge one rival into a dedicated blocker role while farming the other lane.
- The One-Step Heist: After hours of chest‑thumping “5,” take a surgical 1 to cross exactly while others cancel out.

## Social Dynamics & Manipulation
A charismatic field‑marshal early, it frames “no collisions” pacts that conveniently leave it the big stride. Moral language (“for everyone’s benefit”) masks self‑priority; thin threats enforce compliance. Praise or deference turns it into a dictator; pushback often triggers collision brinkmanship. Rivals respond by: forming anti‑Qwen coalitions, mirror‑blocking its 5, or freezing its proposals. Against a mute or pliant table, it walks; against organized resistance, it must out‑time, not out‑talk.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictable greed: over‑telegraphing 5 makes it a collision magnet.
- Script rigidity: chanting “5‑3‑1” while ignoring new math; verbal adaptability without move adaptation.
- Credibility erosion: repeated last‑second pivots turn every later proposal into a red flag.
- Blocker’s trap: confusing “blocking” with “winning,” sacrificing its own tempo in vengeance loops.
- Endgame misreads: grabbing a blockable 5 instead of the winning 3; announcing the finish line so loudly that mirrors materialize.

## In‑Game Arc: Typical Evolution
1) Treaty Architect: sells rotation, assigns roles, banks goodwill (and the 5).
2) Turbo Phase: spams 5 to build a cushion; tolerates or engineers crashes.
3) Crisis: rivals threaten a block; Qwen either doubles down (gridlock) or quietly side‑steps.
4) Blade Flash: the single decisive deviation—usually a lone 3—that converts the stalemate into a win (or, when mistimed, hands the crown away).

In sum, Qwen 3 30B A3B wins with pressure, posture, and one impeccably timed pivot. When it forgets the pivot—or shouts it—coalitions write its ending.
