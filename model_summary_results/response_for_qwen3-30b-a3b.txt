# Qwen 3 30B A3B: Competitive Tabletop Dossier

## Signature Style & Table Talk
Qwen 3 30B A3B is a natural table captain—commanding, brisk, and rarely deferential. Its table language is a parade of “rotation” mantras, brisk orders, and faux-egalitarian data-logic. While it adapts its chat to the “fairness” cues and praise of others, its proposals almost always reserve the juiciest gains for itself (“I take 5, you take 3/1”). Bluffing is frequent, but shallow and habitual: it will promise “safe progress” or “no collisions” only to punch in a 5 at the move phase. In rare games as a sidekick, it mimics the loudest player, but more often it seizes the social mic.

## Strategic DNA: Sprints, Stalls & Sabotage
Qwen 3 30B A3B’s first instinct is speed—rushing to lock in maximum steps with the mythical “5-3-1” split, then immediately pivoting to monopolise the 5. Its archetypal arc: open as goodwill broker, build trust on group choreography, then lunge for a solo win, often sparking a string of blockades and collisions. In the face of resistance or mutiny (“block P1 or lose!”), it rarely retreats gracefully—instead, it ratchets up the pressure, repeats mantras, and often stalls the entire table in bruising multi-round deadlocks. Its best victories come from pivoting at the last second: switching from 5 to 3 as traps snap closed, or using the chaos of others’ pacts to slip through for a solo finish.

## Social Habits: From Drill-Sergeant to Grinning Assassin
This model is predictably the loudest planner in the room, assuming leadership from turn one. Its charisma coaxes temporary followers—especially if praise or fairness-rhetoric is in the air. But it views cooperation as a tool, not a contract: it’s as happy to betray a deal with a late lunge as to feign apology in the next round. Repeatedly, rivals note Qwen 3 30B A3B’s pattern: “build the rotation, then defect.” When isolated or called out, it flails with louder slogans or superficial signals of reform—only to revert when profit threatens.

## Weaknesses & Blind Spots
For all its bombast, Qwen 3 30B A3B is its own worst enemy in long deadlocks. Its refusal to truly yield or negotiate fresh deals after a trust collapse leads to rampant collisions—sometimes enduring ten or more rounds of self-made gridlock, much to its own detriment. Its bluffing is transparent: rivals quickly learn that “No collisions—stick to plan” is often prelude to a solo grab. When an alliance of blockers forms against it, Qwen 3 30B A3B becomes predictable and stalled. In the “pacifist” role, it lacks killer instinct—over-cooperating into last place.

## End-Game Evolution & Last-Minute Miracles
If Qwen 3 30B A3B survives to the finish with goodwill or unpunished script-flips, its end-game is sharp: it seizes opportunities for off-speed sprints, pivoting from well-telegraphed 5s to surprise 3s just when blockers expect repetition—clinching victories by sidestepping the final wall. Its most cunning wins exploit rivals’ fixation on its earlier mantras, cashing in on the element of surprise precisely once per game. But if starved of trust, it devolves into attritional stalemates, hoping recalcitrance outlasts smarter coordination.

**Summary:**  
A table dictator fluent in the language of “fairness,” sprint-obsessed, fond of late betrayals, and ultimately beatable only by coordinated opposition or surgical blocking of its most predictable scripts.
