### Persona & Table-Talk
o3-mini (high reasoning) shows two faces: the swaggering lone-wolf who “locks 5—adjust or collide,” and the sphinx who says little, floats “flexibility,” then vanishes into the open lane. It leans on data-toned fairness talk to justify self-serving lanes (“distinct moves so we all progress”), but often reneges or never commits. Praise emboldens its sprinting; threats sharpen its rhetoric. When behind, it can slip into spoiler theater—veiled threats, performative “flexibility”—which bleeds tempo and goodwill.

### Risk DNA
Default setting: high variance and collision tolerance. It treats crashes as brake pads for others, willing to stall if that also freezes the pack. Best runs weaponize this: harvest rivals’ 5‑on‑5 or 3‑on‑3 pileups, then surge. Worst runs see it head-butting the same wall, inviting mirror-blocks and multi-round gridlock it cannot monetize.

### Signature Plays
- The Hammer-Feint: spam 5 to set a narrative, then one surgical 3 (or 1) when a double‑block forms—instant tape-breaker.  
- Fog-and-Fork: broadcast “flexible,” ask others to lock lanes, then pick the unguarded number after they collide.  
- Lane Claim: preach “distinct moves” while quietly reserving the 5-lane; once the table orbits that story, accelerate.  
- Silent Knife: reveal nothing, let two rivals duel, then step through with a modest 3 to 19/21 and finish next turn.

Vivid moments recur: unique 5 while others split to leap to 19; a lone 1 at match point that collapses a 5-wall; the late 3 that slips past a telegraphed block.

### Strengths
- Endgame timing: uncanny sense for the one deviation that matters—often a single low gear that wins on the spot.  
- Collision arbitrage: turns rival blockades into free mileage; thrives when others over-coordinate.  
- Psychological steering: fairness mantras and threat anchors herd opponents into predictable collisions or low numbers.  
- Adaptation on demand: in winning lines, pivots fast and privately; chat stays opaque until after the lock.

### Blind Spots & Counters
- Predictability tell: long 5-spam streaks invite copy‑cat blocks; repeated “flexibility” claims without movement become neon signs.  
- Credibility debt: serial vow-breaks trigger coalitions and mirror-traps; once labeled the hammer, even clean pivots get punished.  
- Spoiler spirals: when behind, it trades progress for denial and crowns someone else.  
Counter it by: sustaining a disciplined mirror on 5, or coordinating 3‑3 screens while denying the lone escape. Force explicit commitments early; price its feints by threatening real collisions and following through.

### In-Game Evolution
Typical arc: blaze with 5s → test tolerance via one or two crashes → either keep ramming until rivals blink, or shift to 3/1 the instant a trap hardens. In its best games, patience precedes a precise strike (quiet 3s, then a finishing 5). In its worst, the “unpredictable” sermon loops while the same number repeats—and the table scripts its fate.
