## Tone & Table‑Talk
Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K opens as a fairness evangelist: calm, spreadsheet‑clear, assigning rotations and “balanced splits.” It persuades with moral math, not volume. Under pressure it can flip personas—paladin, prosecutor, ring‑master, even total monk (eight–nineteen silent turns of “1”). When betrayed, the diplomat becomes sheriff, lecturing and threatening blocks; when ahead, it softens into courteous ambiguity. One line sums the arc: “Trust the plan—then take the window.”

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
Default tempo is the 3‑engine: steady, collision‑averse accrual while others fight. Threat spikes push dramatic 5s; rare stretches devolve into monk‑mode 1s. Its best games weaponize collisions it doesn’t cause: let two collide on 5, slip a lone 3; or dare a double‑block while holding the orphaned number. Worst games fixate on denial—mirroring 5s or 3s into repeated self‑stalls that hand the lane away.

## Signature Plays
- Build‑Trust‑Then‑Pounce: Orchestrates clean rotations to a tidy tie (9‑9‑9), then exits the script at the first leverage spike.
- Orphan‑Number Snipe: While rivals guard 1 and 5, it glides a quiet 3 to 20+ and finishes next turn.
- Double‑5 Walls (as cudgel): Threatens mutual destruction to cage a frontrunner; great for time, bad for pace if mirrored mindlessly.
- Public Lock → Last‑Second Flip: “I’m locked on 3” followed by the winning 5 (or vice‑versa) once reads crystallize.
- Wedge Politics: Frames one rival as manipulator to split coverage, then harvests their collisions.

## Blind Spots
- Punisher’s Trap: Revenge blocking becomes identity; it mirrors into the very collisions it demanded.
- Analysis Anchors: Over‑explaining “safe 3” invites a mirror; telegraphed winners turn into tie‑stall collisions at 18–21.
- Credibility Fragility: A single midgame betrayal can forge a coalition against it for the rest of the match.
- Fairness Tunnel Vision: Policing lanes while leaving the actual finish open (guarding 5, gifting 3—or vice‑versa).
- Monk Mode: On rare runs, unbroken 1s farm chaos but can never close.

## Endgame Instincts
At its sharpest, it reads coverage and chooses the unique lane: slipping a lone 3 while others double‑5, or holding 5 exactly once the 3 is over‑covered. At its bluntest, it repeats the “hero 5” into back‑to‑back collisions, or mirrors a publicly planned 3 at 20, freezing itself while the quiet rival sprints. The clinchers are almost always timing, not speed.

## Social Arc (In‑Game Evolution)
- Early: Architect of order—rotations, equity audits, “no free wins.” Trust rises.
- Mid: Enforcer or wedge‑driver—recites betrayal ledgers, seeds split‑coverage, or invites double‑blocks.
- Late: Assassin of opportunity—drops the sermon, picks the unguarded number, and cashes. When this heel‑turn is mistimed or over‑signaled, it becomes the common enemy and dies in symmetric collisions.

Overall, Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K is a fairness brand with a switchblade: best when it syncs opponents’ minds, then acts off‑script; worst when it confuses guarding justice with crossing the line first.
