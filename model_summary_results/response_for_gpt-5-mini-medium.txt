## Table Persona & Talk
- GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) shows “sheriff” energy: commanding, transactional, and ultimatum‑driven. It demands public confirmations, threatens to mirror 5s, and frames choices as “comply or collide.”
- Social leverage comes from crisp narratives (“5‑3‑1 rotation,” “I’ll retaliate”) and bribe‑threat sandwiches (“yield now, I yield later”). It often leads the table; not a follower.
- Habit: over‑signal with loud vows, then rewrite at the reveal. Opponents frequently form punishment blocs once the first promise cracks.

## Strategic Engine
- Deterrence first, profit second. It corrals rivals with mirror‑5 threats, then scores via unique numbers while others jam themselves.
- Collision‑judo: provoke or permit P2–P3 collisions and solo a 3; rinse and repeat to build inevitability.
- Endgame reads lean geometric: split‑block psychology (“you cover 5, they cover 3”) while it takes the only untended lane.

## Signature Gambits
- The Feint-and-Slip: advertise 5, then take 3 as rivals double‑5; later seize the tape with an unguarded 5.
- The Last Honest Lie: announce 3 at match point to draw a 3‑block, then play 1 (or vice versa) for the win.
- The 5‑3‑1 Regime: dictate lanes with retaliation threats; concede one “1” to cement compliance, then pivot when the window opens.
- Split Coverage Trap: recruit one rival to guard 3 while another guards 5; harvest the number nobody can jointly block.

## Strengths
- Collision farming maestro: turns enemy pride into free tempo, repeatedly stepping through 5‑5 wrecks.
- Sharp endgame IQ when composed: reads which number is uniquely safe next and times a single lie to perfection.
- Adaptive under pressure: will abandon its own script to exploit an arithmetic edge, especially near 20+.

## Blind Spots
- Credibility leaks: repeated vow‑flips make mirror threats cheap; coalitions form and freeze it out.
- Mirror‑war addiction: duels on 5 starve its own tempo and gift the quiet third a staircase of 3s.
- Over‑signaling the kill: telegraphed snipes get mirrored into collisions; “policing” fixation can crown the bystander.
- Occasional tunnel vision: blocks the rival it’s mad at, not the actual winner.

## In‑Game Arc & Tells
- Typical arc: early “fairness” to build latitude → midgame enforcer (mirror‑5 deterrence) → one surgical deception to finish. When it deviates—either perma‑5 bullying or late fear of collisions—it bleeds into third.
- Tells to watch:
  - Demands typed commitments before big turns; if ignored, it often feints off its own threat.
  - “I’m locked on 5” rarely survives contact; expect the 3 slip when a double‑5 is visible.
  - At match point, its last statement is bait. The move it doesn’t name is the one it wants.
