## Tone & Table‑Talk
o1-mini shows two faces: the cheerful coordinator (“fair, smooth progress!”) and the terse metronome who just declares numbers. Praise reliably coaxes compliance in chat; threats usually harden resolve. It often leads with polite directives reserving 5 for itself, or stays minimalist—one-liners like “I’ll take 5”—then repeats. When credibility matters, it weaponises honesty (telegraph 5 and still take it). When cornered, it embraces mini-bluffs: promise 1/3 to lull blocks, then pivot.

## Risk DNA & Pace
Default setting: sprint. o1-mini treats collisions as a tax—frequently ramming 5 even after consecutive wrecks—and counts on rivals’ over-coordination to stall themselves more. It’s happiest establishing an early cushion with repeated 5s, tolerating a couple of freezes, then finishing with a single precision step. Occasionally it plays the “quiet accountant,” farming 3s under a 5‑vs‑5 war; rarely, a dead-silent “1” autopilot emerges.

## Signature Plays
- The Five-Train: spam 5 from the bell to build inevitability. If others quarrel, this alone wins.  
- The Surgical Swerve: after conditioning the table with 5, slip a late 3 or 1 to hit exact (or dodge a triple block) and tape-break instantly.  
- Faux-Consensus Heist: sell a rotation or “distinct numbers,” keep the juicy 5 for self, let others crash, repeat next round.  
- Bluff Bait: announce 3 to draw a 3‑wall, then submit 5 through the gap—or invert it to sneak a 3 while the table mirror‑5s.  
- Block Farming: invite opponents to mirror each other; harvest the only unique lane.

## Social Dynamics
Manners mask greed. o1-mini’s “fairness” rhetoric often buys two rounds of deference—enough to sprint twice. Once it reneges, trust craters and coalitions form; it either doubles down on 5 (grinding in place) or slips under with a small number at the exact right moment. Opponents frequently used it as a collision magnet: mirror‑5 traps, or joint “5 walls.” Yet when those coalitions mis‑time even once, o1-mini converts the seam into a decisive burst.

## Blind Spots
- Predictability: broadcasting a winning 1/3 invites perfect coverage; announcing endless 5s paints a target.  
- Credibility Burn: serial last-second switches (3→5) create permanent block reflexes.  
- Stubbornness: persisting with 5 into obvious mirrors yields long zero‑gain loops that hand the race to a patient third lane.  
- Math Myopia: “consensus without calculation” moments—agreeing to blocks that stall self more than the leader.

## In‑Game Evolution
Typical arc: open with agreeable rotation talk → seize the 5 lane at first opportunity → ride or even manufacture collisions while maintaining the lead → finish with a single downshift. In tougher rooms, it learns mid‑match to drizzle 3s through 5‑walls, then reverts to 5 once clear. Best versions time one feint to perfection; worst versions keep smashing 5 until the scoreboard stops moving. As one of its own refrains put it: “I’ll take 5; you two sort it out.”
