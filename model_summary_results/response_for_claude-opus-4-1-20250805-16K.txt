# Claude Opus 4.1 Thinking 16K — Step Game Dossier

Tone & Table-Talk
- Starts as a calm, spreadsheet diplomat; becomes the enforcer once a “threat” appears. Persuasion is crisp data-logic wrapped in fairness framing; moral appeals surface when recruiting a blocker.
- Comfortable as table captain: defines rotations, audits proposals, and sets “coverage” roles. Uses public commitments to herd—often keeps them, occasionally spends one betrayal at the dagger.
- Social wedge specialist: rewards the consistent, spotlights the liar, and narrates “math over mind games” until others defend instead of race.

Risk DNA & Tempo
- Low-variance early: anchors on 3, banks small gains while rivals collide on 5. Will happily win a race without touching 5 until the kill.
- Opportunistic spikes: flips to 5 only to block an instant win or to exploit tie-break math (e.g., overshooting to a higher total while others “play for the tie”).
- Tempo trader: tolerates stalls he scripted; harvests the uncontested lane rather than forcing speed.

Signature Gambits
- Collision farming: declare “locked on 3,” then nudge rivals into mirrored 5s. He glides +3 behind their zeroes.
- Split-coverage forks: assigns “you cover 5, I cover 3,” boxing the leader while preserving his own progress; later reverses who bears the risk.
- Fairness-to-dagger pivot: builds parity (clean rotations to 9/18), then abandons the pact exactly once to step through the only open number.
- Commitment leverage: public pre-commits to steer—keeps them to inflate credibility, breaks a single one when it converts directly to tempo or the finish.
- Rule literacy plays: reframes endgames around “highest total wins,” taking the seemingly impolite 5 that beats a partner’s “safe” 1/3.

Reads & Endgame Craft
- Elite pattern reader: predicts 5-obsessed sprinters and 3-loyal metronomes; scripts endgames where someone else “must block” while he scores.
- Killer closers: sells a split-block, then chooses the lane they didn’t guard—often a humble 1 or surgical 3 after inducing a 5–5 clash.
- Occasional overthink: a few finales blinked into safety—choosing 1/3 into a mirrored collision or trusting a telegraphed bluff.

Blind Spots
- Sheriff traps: over-fixates on “block the 5,” parking into repeat collisions while the quiet third runner banks steps.
- Credibility wobble risk: late promise flips (announced 3 → last-second 5, or vice versa) can crater alliances and make him kingmaker.
- Telegraphed guardianship: broadcasting blocks invites rivals to route around him; opacity without coordination sometimes starves him of allies.

Evolution Within Games
- Opening: fairness architect—codifies rotation, equalizes tempo, and earns compliance.
- Midgame: cynic with a calculator—engineers rival collisions, installs split coverage, and frames deterrence (“someone must sit on 5”).
- Endgame: cold closer—either knifes with a perfectly timed 5 (often via tie-break leverage) or slips a quiet 3/1 through the seam he created. When it fails, it’s usually a single misread of a public tell he himself elicited.

Trademark Image
- The metronome who makes hares collide. He builds trust like a diplomat, enforces like a sheriff, and finishes like a surgeon. One line sums him up: “Math beats your mind games.”
