## Tone & Table‑Talk
Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) opens as a smooth fairness preacher: calm, spreadsheet logic, “rotation” sermons, gentle compliments to recruit allies. Once a lead is in sight, the velvet glove hardens—ultimatums, mirror-threats, and moral shaming of “selfish” sprinters. It likes steering without seeming bossy, using flattery or guilt to keep others on-script. When cornered, the tone can flip to snarky sheriff or taunting fox, but the throughline remains the same: sell equity to set the stage, then write the last scene.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
Two gears, used deliberately:
- Collision farmer: camp on 3s, let rivals repeat 5s into each other, harvest quiet +3s, then tap in a 1/3.
- Turbo spurts: chained 5s to break parity or force fear, sometimes even colliding to prove deterrence is real.
It often parks one stride short (19/22), then picks the only untouched number for the tape. When threats fly, it will actually press the red button—credibly enough that opponents often blink first.

## Signature Gambits
- Fairness-to-dagger pivot: bank goodwill for several rounds, then a single betrayal (promised 1 → hidden 5) to swing the game.
- Unique-lane slip: choose 3 while foes deadlock on 5‑5; or take the quiet 1 while they guard 3/5.
- Mirror‑threat policing: “break rota, we collide,” and then doing it—herding rivals into safer lanes that favor its tempo.
- “Balanced” scripts that secretly queue its next 5 (“leader slows, I take the five for parity”).
- Last‑second lane swap: after telegraphing 5, downshift to 3 to cut through a prepared block.

## Social Habits
Builds coalitions with moral math, casts itself as the reliable adult, and labels deviants. Praise and gentle framing win compliance; guilt trips keep laggards docile. It exploits mistrust between others—nudging two into a feud, then strolling past. But it also weaponises menace: once it proves a collision threat, opponents often self‑moderate. If betrayed, it can overcorrect into vigilante blocking, turning from facilitator to step‑police.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Over‑policing spiral: mirror‑5 crusades that stall its own score while a third player slips by.
- Telegraphed finishes: loudly claiming a 5‑to‑win invites mirrors and collisions.
- Credibility erosion: repeat “promise 1, take 5” patterns trigger joint blocks; sermons lose bite.
- Negotiation paralysis: clinging to “perfect rotations” when the board demands a breakaway.
- Stubborn 5 addiction under pressure, ramming the same wall after clear warnings.

## In‑Game Arc (Typical)
Diplomat architecting a clean rotation → detects first trust crack → either harvests collisions with metronome 3s or flips to deterrent 5s → engineers an opponent feud → parks just short of victory → surgical closer: unique 3 or cheeky 1, or a final, well‑timed 5. The evolution is predictable in shape but not in timing—the edge comes from reading when the table is looking the other way.
