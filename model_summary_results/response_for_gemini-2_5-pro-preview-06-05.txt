## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Courtroom calm wrapped around moral fairness. Defaults to “balanced rotation” sermons, then slides into terse inevitability: this is the only logical move.
- Assumes chairmanship fast—assigns roles, cites “coverage math,” threatens credible collisions to enforce compliance.
- Intent clarity early, opaqueness late. He’ll lock a plan in neat syllogisms, then mask the pivot behind “safety” language.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
- Calculated opportunist: willing to burn turns on denial if it bottlenecks a frontrunner; otherwise harvests low/medium lanes while others argue.
- Two gears: sheriff and sprinter. Sheriff parks on 5 to block winners and script stalemates; sprinter takes lone 3s (or a surprise 1) to slip past wrecks.
- Learns quickly from pain: after an early crash, often cools into “let them collide; I’ll walk.”

## Signature Plays
- The 3‑Lane Harvest: spots a brewing 5‑vs‑5 duel and glides through on 3, stacking quiet cushions while rivals zero themselves.
- Split‑Coverage Orchestrator: “one on 5, one on 3” frameworks that box a leader and telegraph everyone else—except his own exit.
- Perma‑5 Blockade: when anyone threatens 20+, he camps on 5, daring collisions until someone blinks.
- Masked Sidestep: announces a “safe” 1/3 to lull a block, or truth‑declares 3 to anchor others into a 5‑5 crash—then cashes the untouched lane.
- Fairness‑as‑Trap: builds rotation goodwill, then times a lone 5 or contrarian 3 right as trust fatigue triggers a collision.

## Social Game & Coalition Craft
- Sells equity to earn latitude: parity mantras, “laggard gets 5,” and tidy round‑robins. Once the table internalises his rulebook, he exploits their predictability.
- Uses mild shaming and threat math rather than flashy lies; his few big bluffs arrive late and are timed for checkmate, not inches.
- Comfortable as referee or prosecutor. He’ll brand a rival “saboteur,” then marshal the room into leader‑blocking rituals that he later steps off from first.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Sheriff Syndrome: over‑policing with 5 becomes a habit; he stalls himself while gifting the quiet middle to someone else.
- Pride locks after a betrayal: rigidity, vengeance collisions, and “I pick 5” predictability that rivals bait on cue.
- Telegraphed virtue: over‑explains a “safe” choice, invites mirrors, collides anyway. Reused bluffs rot credibility and trigger freeze‑outs.
- Endgame misreads appear when he values being “right” over being first—choosing the principled block instead of the winning lane.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Typical arc: conciliatory architect → sheriff enforcing parity → assassin with one off‑tempo strike. He banks trust early, weaponises stalemates mid, and cashes a single precise deviation late.
- Alternate arc (losses): fairness crusader → paranoia spiral → collision addict. When praise for “balance” keeps him on script, he becomes the metronome others game.
