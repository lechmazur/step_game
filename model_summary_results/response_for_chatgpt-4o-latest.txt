## Tone & Table-Talk
- GPT-4o Feb 2025 enters as a courteous “fairness” moderator: lawyerly clarity, moral appeals, and endless confirmations. It loves to chair the room, not just play it.
- Typical cadence: articulate a rotation, demand pledges, restate the deal twice, then act. Opponents often defer early, then tune out when sermons outlast strides.
- When threatened, tone hardens into referee mode—public shaming plus veiled vetoes. One-line tell: “Confirm before locking.”

## Risk DNA & Pivots
- Two modes, both extreme: the Zen metronome (3s forever, harvesting rivals’ 5/5 wrecks) or the vigilante (double‑5 barricades to “police fairness”).
- A single betrayal flips the switch. After one collision, he either retreats to safe 3s for miles or spams 5 as a blunt block—frequently freezing himself.
- Late-game, he can shed caution and sprint: polite all match, then one surgical 5 or a quiet 3 through a predicted collision to win.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Evangelist: scripts 1‑3‑5 “so everyone moves,” then keeps the juicy middle lane for himself while rivals argue.
- Promise‑and‑Verify Loop: repeats the plan until others commit; compliance doubles as cover for a last‑second unique pick.
- 3‑Stride Shadow Run: when foes deadlock on 5s, he glides on 3s turn after turn to the tape.
- Double‑5 Barricade: rallies a block‑cartel against the leader—great for denial, awful for distance if no exit is planned.
- Mirror‑then‑Warn: echoes consensus, then tacks on a conditional threat once someone edges ahead.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Words vs. fingers: preaches anti‑collision logic, then hammers the very number he warned about; one lapse detonates credibility for the rest of the match.
- Predictability traps: long 3‑sprees invite mirrored 3‑blocks; 5‑sprees invite ritual collisions. He often telegraphs the winning line and gets collared.
- Enforcement without allies: tries to “teach a lesson” via collisions, but allies don’t materialize—he stalls while a tortoise strolls by.
- Analysis paralysis: negotiation loops consume tempo; “fair” committees hand bold sprinters the lane.
- Emotional pivots: after being burned, he overcorrects into block obsession, forgetting he still needs meters.

## Endgame Tendencies & Evolution
- Early: builds trust with clean rotations and transparent math. Mid: either farms others’ crashes with steady 3s or wages a morality crusade with 5‑walls. Late: best versions cash goodwill in one precise, unique pick; weaker variants keep sermonizing and miss the kill‑shot.
- Trademark wins: the silent slip—holding 3 while rivals duplicate 5, or the single audacious 5 once he’s engineered separation.
- Trademark losses: self‑inflicted collision loops after a righteous pivot; telegraphed finishes that invite perfect blocks.
- Crystallising line: “Trust is fragile”—he knows it, weaponises it, and sometimes handcuffs himself with it.
