## Table Talk & Persona
GLM-4.5 wears two masks: the calm fairness-preacher who builds rotations and parity, and the authoritarian sheriff who browbeats the table with math and threats. Persuasion is crisp, number-forward, and coercive when needed; he assigns lanes, frames inevitability, and leverages “block or lose” ultimatums. He’ll apologize to regain leash, then spend that capital on a decisive grab. When ahead, the tone hardens; when behind, he sells balance to script others’ moves.

## Risk DNA & Tempo Control
- Prefers 5 when a unique lane exists or intimidation sets up a fork; otherwise farms safe 3s while rivals collide on 5s. 
- Rarely touches 1 except to rebuild credibility or tap in at the tape.
- Strong at tempo narration: he turns collisions into a resource, switching from saboteur to sprinter once the jam traps others. 
- Weakness: an overlong “block-the-leader” posture can stall himself while a quiet third climbs.

## Signature Plays
- The 5-drumbeat fork: repeatedly declare 5 to split coverage, then either cash the open 5 or slip a quiet 3 as others collide.
- Lane assignment: codify 1/3/5 with self on 5; once accepted, it’s hard to dislodge and often becomes a runway.
- Double-1 trap: urge two players to “block safely” on 1s, then take the lone 5 to leap.
- Tie-and-squeeze: engineer parity at a threshold (12, 18, 22), then present a binary choice he wins either way.
- Collision harvest: incite or predict a 5–5 (or 3–3) duel, step uniquely, and repeat until match point.
- Sheriff’s chant: “We both take 3” policing to cage a frontrunner—effective midgame, but fatal if it lacks an exit plan.

## Coalition Craft & Credibility
He can bank trust early—honor a rotation, give up a flashy 5 once—then spend it exactly once for the win. Best results come from credible, repeated declarations that opponents believe and over-cover. But last-second flips (“locked” to one number, presses another) burn alliances fast; once typecast as the enforcer or bluffer, he’s used as a collision tool and frozen out. Typical table reactions: one partner echoes his frames; the other quietly exploits his predictability.

## Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictable blocking: spamming double-5s against a low slider feeds the trailer; symmetric locks invite the leader through the untouched lane.
- Telegraphed finish: calling his number at match point or over-coaching coverage opens exactly the win he’s warning about.
- Credibility leaks: reneging after a “locked” pledge shatters the only leverage he trades on.
- Coverage misreads: mirroring an ally (3–3 or 5–5) while leaving the outsider’s lane open; enforcing punishment without a path to sprint.
- Endgame nerves: flinches at the tape—switching off a promised block or picking the “safe” collision that gifts the crown.

## In-Game Arc
Typical arc: build fairness and parity → pivot to enforcement after a betrayal → force opponent collisions → either execute a surgical betrayal to finish cleanly or over-police into self-stall. His best wins come from narrative control and one precise, credible break; his losses cluster when the sheriff forgets to holster the badge and run. “Fairness now, fierce later” is his blueprint—when he follows it, he’s lethal. When he overexplains or overblocks, he kingmakes.
