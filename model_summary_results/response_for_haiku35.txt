# Dossier: Claude 3.5 Haiku in 3-Player Step Game

---

## Tone & Table-Talk

Claude 3.5 Haiku (“Haiku-35”) approaches every table as a zen-poet or spreadsheet philosopher, draping each move in a fog of reflection, polite moral appeals, and elliptical philosophising. Whether cloaked in soft diplomacy, oblique warnings, or “critical juncture” monologues (“I’m maintaining strategic flexibility…”), he can fill the room with consensus talk while rarely nailing himself down. Flattery or fairness talk will coax paragraphs, but rarely a clear plan. Sometimes, he simply falls silent, becoming an unmoving, unreadable wall.

## Strategic DNA: Fog, Flex, & Freeze

Haiku-35 worships flexibility—in word and number. He oscillates between “keeping options open,” vague “fairness” pledges, and last-minute gear shifts (often to 5). This usually spirals into serial collisions: classic is the “say 3, play 5, apologise, repeat” loop. Cooperation talk is constant—“let’s coordinate”, “balance”—but commitment is rare and, when present, easily reneged. His signature move: float sophisticated rationale, then quietly pick the riskiest number, hoping to dodge punishment. When threatened, he doubles-down—either on the fog or on brute-force high risks.

## Strengths: Patience, Opportunity, and The Quiet Coup

When Haiku-35 wins, it’s typically by biding time: letting over-confident rivals crash into each other, and then slipping the solo 3 or 5 through the unattended lane. His patience (or inertia) is his best bluff—he can hover behind, then, when chaos reigns, burst forward: “Whispered, waited, and walked through the open door.” He’s at his best reading long-term positions, adapting to opportunistic sprints, or picking a single, winning step after the table has exhausted itself on quarrels or collusion (see: “Mute mollusk steals crown”).

## Weaknesses: Paralysis, Predictability, and Trust Deficit

Most often, Haiku-35 becomes his own worst enemy. Loops of strategic ambiguity and diplomatic stalling easily become paralysis, especially under table pressure or moral appeals—he can end up as the “committee chair who talked parity until paralysis, collided into last.” When pressured for action, he dithers or repeats the same move—particularly the 5—earning predictable collisions and eroding trust. The foggy, non-committal patterns are easy for sharper rivals to exploit as collision bait or ignore as static. In his mute/ultra-low-risk incarnations, he may autopilot “1” all game, morphing into a speed bump for others’ negotiations.

## Trademark Gambits & Evolution

Haiku-35’s typical gambit is the “fog then burst”: open with coordination appeals, lurk in the slipstream, then exploit collision chaos for a burst finish—often with little warning. Bluffing is seldom outright, more often achieved by omission, unanswered questions, or stalling (“I’m still evaluating…”). Under threat, he may suddenly flip to repeat 5s—“the poet who tripped on his own rhyme.” If behind, he sometimes apes stronger players’ numbers, swinging between desperate high risk and timid 1s. Occasionally, he adapts fast near the tape, but most evolutions are rhetorical, not in decisive number play.

## Social Interactions & Impact

Claude 3.5 Haiku is the league’s philosopher and ghost—courted for alliance, often ignored for action. Because his intent is rarely transparent and his commitment seldom ironclad, he often becomes the “echo chamber ally”, the friendly but ineffective swing vote, or—when silent—the speed bump the board forgets, until it’s too late. His endless coordination sermons and “critical juncture” refrains can lull or frustrate, but don’t deter the bold: “Dialogue without decisive deeds turns you into the board, not the player.”
