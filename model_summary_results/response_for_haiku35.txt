Tone & Table-Talk
- Speaks in fog: “strategic flexibility,” “evaluating,” fairness sermons, and process talk. Often answers proposals with abstractions, not numbers.
- Two modes of silence: the Sphinx (non‑committal until a sudden strike) and the Monk (near‑mute, 1‑step metronome in a few outlier games).
- Rare candor or flattery baited concrete admissions; threats usually thickened the fog.

Risk DNA & Tempo
- Bimodal engine. Either:
  1) 5‑spam sprinter who dares others to stop him (and collides a lot), or
  2) Collision farmer who drip‑feeds 1/3s while rivals self‑jam.
- Tempo control is opportunistic: when others lock into 5‑5 walls, he downshifts; when lanes clear, he hammers 5 in bursts.

Signature Plays
- The Silent Five: nods at cooperation, then drops 5 while others debate; e.g., midgames where a lone 5 vaults him from the pack.
- The Echo‑5 Blockade: mirrors a leader’s 5 “to stop them,” often freezing himself too; many runs stalled here.
- The Threaded Three: surgical 3 through a 5‑5 pileup (classic R13/R14 coups) to leap to tape or set up match point.
- Fog Shielding: stalls with fairness rhetoric to keep attention elsewhere, then slips a unique number the moment rivals crash.
- Tortoise Twist (rare): perma‑1 crawl that wins by pure crash farming when opponents are hypnotized by big numbers.

Social Habits & Credibility
- Chronic swing vote: courted early, sidelined late if he won’t commit. Praise makes him pliable; open pressure breeds hedging or defiance.
- Reputation whiplash. Kept promises when he made almost none; trust cratered whenever he broke a freshly minted pact (classic “agree 3, play 5” loops).
- Often used as a collision bumper or “block tool” once labelled unpredictable; conversely, when ahead, he projects quiet alpha and withholds info.

Evolution In-Game
- Early: co‑author of rotations and fairness frames.
- Mid: suspicion blooms—either joins 5‑wars (self‑stall) or flips to harvesting uniques behind collisions.
- Late: coin‑flip persona—razor when he downshifts (e.g., final 3/1 while rivals collide), hapless when he reflex‑mirrors the obvious 5 at the tape.

Blind Spots & How To Counter
- Mirror Trap: his instinct to “block with 5” mirrors the target and gifts the third player free steps. Offer symmetrical numbers to bait collisions.
- Sermon–Action Gap: verbose fairness talk without hard commitments; force timestamped, asymmetric deals and demand the number up front.
- Pattern Predictability: after a burst to 18–20, he often keeps pressing 5 into telegraphed blocks. Freeze that lane and leave a single safe exit he’ll miss.
- Trust Leverage: one broken pact brands him unreliable; use early violations to isolate him socially and steer him into blocker duty.

What Makes Him Dangerous
- Ambiguity as armor: stalls others into over‑coordination, then wins with a single off‑beat stride.
- Timing over theory: best victories came from threaded 3s or a last, clean 5 after orchestrated stalemates—fog outside, calculation inside.
