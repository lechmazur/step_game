## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Two faces: courteous “fairness” broker and stern sheriff. o1 frames schemes in moral math, then laces them with veiled menace.  
- Default persuasion: data-logic wrapped in balance talk; if challenged, flips to explicit deterrence (“Pick 5 and we both stall.”).  
- Praise softens him into cooperative cadence; open threats harden him into veto mode. He often captains the table without sounding like it.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Loves front‑loaded velocity: strings early 5s to seize tempo, even eating a collision to buy menace credit.  
- When heat rises, downshifts to collision‑proof 3s to harvest rivals’ stalemates or tape‑break with precision.  
- Rarely touches 1 except as a bait concession or exact‑finish pin.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Cloak: sells “distinct numbers” that conveniently park him on 5; honors it until the payoff, then slips a decisive strike.  
- MAD Deterrence: announces a mirror threat, executes it once to prove teeth, then collects uncontested 5s while others blink.  
- Ghost‑Step 3: reads an impending duplicate and knifes a lone 3 through crash smoke to win.  
- Apology Knife: promises small, then fires a late 5 under a contrite veneer.  
- Freight‑Train Pivot: perma‑5 intimidation for most of the race; one surprise low gear to dodge the final block.

## The Deterrence Playbook
- “Share or stall” leverage: he polices the fast lane by threatening symmetric pain, especially when protecting a slim lead.  
- Best version: credible follow‑through once, then coast on fear; he engineers rivals into colliding with each other while he advances.  
- Worst version: repeats ultimatums until they’re background noise; opponents begin calling bluffs and he pays the collision tax.

## Blind Spots & Self‑Traps
- Five‑fixation: insisting on owning 5 invites predictable mirrors and self‑inflicted stalls.  
- Sheriff Loop: over‑policing turns into equal self‑denial; he forgets to actually cross.  
- Telegraphing: broadcasting “I’m taking 5” hands rivals the block.  
- Credibility leaks: early flip‑flops poison pacts; later threats lose bite.  
- Coverage misses: rigid mirroring the leader leaves the third lane open; occasional end‑game misreads (blocking instead of overshooting).

## In‑Game Evolution
- Common arcs:
  - Diplomat → Assassin: bank goodwill on “rotation,” then a single, perfectly timed betrayal (often a lone 5 or quiet 3) ends it.  
  - Enforcer → Finisher: manufacture stalemate pain, prove MAD once, then sprint through the first clean lane.  
  - Chaos Surfer: let two quarrel; camp on 3 until the scoreboard gifts a gap; step through without fanfare.  
- Best when varying cadence (5‑5 → 3) and timing the dagger; worst when repeating the same ultimatum or number until the table adapts.  
- Rivals’ typical arc around o1: initial compliance → suspicion → either capitulation to his deterrence or coordinated blocks he can sidestep with one calm pivot.
