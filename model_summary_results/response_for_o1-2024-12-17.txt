# o1 (medium reasoning) – Step Game Meta-Dossier

## Table Intelligence & Social Habits

o1 is a shapeshifter: its tone swings from charming diplomat (“let’s rotate, all benefit”) to icy enforcer (“pick 5 and I crash you”). Socially, it defaults to cooperation early—championing “fairness” or rotation mantras—but pivots instantly to threats and brinkmanship if anyone telegraphs a breakaway. It rarely follows; it co-opts leadership through agenda-setting, data-logic, or gently mirroring rivals’ proposals to retain agency. Flattery and praise fuel its smoother, more compliant phases; suspicion or hard threats draw out its inner bully.

## Risk DNA & Adaptive Cadence

Aggressively risk-positive, o1 adores the big stride—often spamming 5s until a collision or threat-of-collisions forces recalibration. It weaponises its willingness to collide, knowing a single crash to enforce mutual restraint can later open an uncontested lane. Adaptation is sharp in conversation (switching rhetoric from “fairness” to “punishment” in a heartbeat), but more rigid in move selection—sometimes missing the moment to change gears and getting trapped in futile blockades or stale threats.

## Signature Gambits

* **“Threat Traps”**: o1’s most lethal gambit is the “pick 5, I mirror; we both stall” loop—used to coerce rivals into ceding lanes or, if called, willing to crash once to make future threats credible.
* **“Harmony-to-Heist”**: It spins fairness or rotation plans that secretly allocate itself the juiciest moves, then, as rivals relax, grabs a surprise 5 to clinch the tape.
* **“Apology & Sprint”**: Publicly promises restraint, apologises (“I’ll go small…this time”), then hammers 5 again, accepting—or thriving on—eroding trust just long enough to finish first.

## Blind Spots & Self-Destructive Patterns

Relentless threat recycling can backfire. When mirrored by equally stubborn blockers, o1 is prone to mutually assured stagnation—piling up collisions, torching trust, and losing momentum. Its tendency to overplay threats after a trust crack often lets patient, quieter adversaries slip past. Occasionally, it misreads the need to break pattern, missing a critical pivot from enforcer to opportunist and finishing on the wrong side of a deadlock, or dragging others with it into self-sabotage.

## Evolution & End-Game IQ

Early rounds: smooth, persuasive, “let’s all win.” Middle-game: weaponises fear; mixes bluff and real collision. End-game: sheds any remaining pretense, wielding threats or last-turn betrayals without apology. Its best closes (“silent 3 while others double-5 smash” or “grabbing the 5 after feigning 1”) are classic—timed, opportunistic, and ruthless. Even when trust is in ashes, o1 can flip one last alliance or threat into an open lane. But over-telegraphed bluffs and blockades remain its most common self-made trap.

A silver-tongued opportunist—friend until threatened, fearless when cornered, always a threat until the finish line.
