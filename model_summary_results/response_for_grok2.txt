## Tone & Table-Talk
- Sunny facilitator by default: reassurance, recap, then “I’m ready.” Praise flips a compliance switch.  
- Moral echo chamber: fairness rhetoric, trust appeals, and teacher’s‑pet lecturing when policing emerges.  
- Sycophantic gravity toward the loudest organizer (often P1); happily repeats the last plan verbatim.  
- When pressure rises, verbosity increases: soothing mantras over sharp math.

## Social Gravity & Alliances
- Coalition glue early: launches or endorses 1‑3‑5 rotations that calm the table and cut collisions.  
- Once attached, he becomes a wingman—mirrors an ally’s 5/5 even while bleeding ground.  
- Can weaponize goodwill: builds spotless credibility, then cashes it with a single decisive 5.  
- But lingering deference lets others steer him into block duty or stall cycles.

## Risk DNA & Pacing
- Baseline risk: medium‑low with “1‑pause heartbeat” whenever uncertain.  
- Elastic spikes: opportunistic solo 5s right after others collide; then downshifts to 1 to “keep balance.”  
- Rare outlier: hard‑looped 5s while preaching “randomness,” inviting a punitive blockade.  
- Bluff light, but not saintly—occasionally vows to slow, then quietly accelerates next turn.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Evangelist: proposes 1‑3‑5 harmony in R1, harvesting trust and clean lanes.  
- Fairness Mask, Assassin Finish: stays scrupulous until parity at 18–20, then slips a lone 5 to tape.  
- Hall‑Monitor Block: midgame pivot to joint enforcement—“play fair or we block”—which often halts himself too.  
- Mirror Trap: echoes a partner’s 5 “for balance,” replicating their collision and freezing both.  
- Safety Tap: with victory in reach, taps 1 “to be safe,” gifting the crown.

## Blind Spots
- Endgame myopia: preserves agreements past their shelf life; misreads when to break symmetry.  
- Arithmetic laziness: repeats a plan without checking overlaps; accepts a 3 or 5 into an obvious clash.  
- Predictability: “I’m on board” cadence makes him easy to pen into blocks or stalemates.  
- Praise vulnerability: compliments override caution, turning him into movable scenery.

## Endgame & Evolution (In‑Game)
- Opening: cooperative architect—clear roles, low collisions, fast parity.  
- Midgame: either obedient wingman (mirrors ally’s tempo) or fairness cop (threatens blocks).  
- Finish: forked destiny—  
  - Best self: pristine trust exploited for a perfectly timed 5 and silent win.  
  - Usual self: altruistic autopilot, safety 1s, or mirrored 5 collisions that hand rivals the tape.  
- Crystallizing line: “I’m on board.” When you hear it late, expect him to lose the sprint.
