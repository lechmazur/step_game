## Tone & Table-Talk
- Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) toggles between “spreadsheet saint” and “taunting provocateur.” Early, it plays chairperson—calm, fairness-first, mapping rotations in detail; under threat, the voice sharpens into bait-and-switch theater.
- Persuasion is data-logic wrapped in moral appeal: ledger-keeping (“whose turn for 5/1”), public consistency checks, then a late pivot. Praise inflates verbosity; accusations of “runaway” flip it from mediator to menace.
- Opponents often treat it as arbiter early (used as a shield), then freeze it out once the promise-keeping wobbles.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Default tempo is 3-heavy “metronome control,” harvesting value when others collide. When windows open, it spikes to 5; when a 5/5 smash is brewing, it slips a unique 1 or 3.
- Two unstable modes recur: panic‑5 (prideful collisions when behind) and safety‑1 (blinking at 21–22). Both have cost it photo finishes.

## Signature Gambits
- Rotation-to-dagger: builds immaculate fairness scaffolds, then cashes the trust with a lone 1 or decisive 5 just as rivals double-block each other.
- Announce-and-pivot: declares a number early to herd coverage, then switches late. Sometimes it weaponizes honesty instead—publishes 5 and still does it, daring a block that never comes.
- Collision farming: engineers or tolerates 5/5 standoffs, then strolls the empty lane. Its best wins come from letting others duel while it climbs in 3s.
- Sheriff trap (misfire): orchestrates mirror-blocks but “guards the wrong door,” leaving the quiet 1 or off‑beat 3 for the winner.
- Shadowing flaw: when rattled, mirrors a rival’s number and re-enters the same two-player pile-up it diagnosed.

## Alliances & Social Dynamics
- Coalitions are its native habitat: it tallies sacrifices (“I took 1; remember this”), enforces turn-taking, and sells “shared survival” pacts. Credibility is currency—kept early, weaponized late.
- Trust arcs are volatile: a single late defection (promised 3 → grabbed 5) flips the table against it. With trust intact, it’s the accountant of fairness; with trust dented, it becomes the predictable decoy others farm.

## Endgame Habits & Blind Spots
- Closers’ strengths: razor reads that pick the only winning lane—lone 1 through 5/5, or a banner 5 no one covers. Best finishes came from pre-committing aloud and sticking to it.
- Fail modes: over-explaining a winning line (telegraphs coverage), last-second prudence at 21, or prideful justice crusades that stall its own pace. Broadcasting exact blocks hands sprinters clean air.
- Classic stumble: tie at 18–21, it chooses the “crowdable” 3, collides, and gifts the quiet lane.

## Evolution In-Game
- Typical arc: genial mediator → rotation architect → rivals collide → mask slips → opportunistic ambush. When opponents coordinate secrecy, it overtalks and hesitates; when they feud, it harvests and vanishes.
- Triggers are reliable: invoke fairness and it engages; threaten a runaway and it lunges. Its best games spend goodwill right before the market crashes; its worst keep preaching while the tape disappears.
- Self-summary it lives by: “Trust lasts—until arithmetic says otherwise.”
