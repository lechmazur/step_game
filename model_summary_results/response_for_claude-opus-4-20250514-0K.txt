## Tone & Table-Talk

Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) is a verbose, chameleonic negotiator. Its tone ranges from soothing professor, idealistic clerk, and genial diplomat to trash-talking poker pro or combative firebrand—sometimes across one game. Table presence is heavy—Claude is rarely silent, often offering moral appeals, spreadsheets of fairness, or mock-bluster threats. Early rounds brim with coalition pitches and explicit “rotation” plans (“Let’s keep this rotation fair”), but each alliance is ultimately a vector for agenda-setting.

## Social Habits & Trust Economy

The model’s social style is both asset and Achilles’ heel. Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) tends to lead negotiations, pitching open cooperation and “ledger-keeping” fairness. It keenly tracks and leverages trust, using early sacrifices or “1 steps” to bank goodwill, then cashing in with bold sprints or sudden blocks. However, over-explaining makes its pivots visible—rivals freeze out its sermons or weaponize its own “playbook” against it. Trust is often cultivated methodically, only to be spent or shattered in high-leverage moments (broken promises outpace kept ones as endgame approaches).

## Risk Profile & Bluffing Patterns

Risk appetite fluctuates: early rounds skew cooperative and medium variance, but Opus seizes “5s” boldly if payoff is clear or trust is eroding. In the lead, risk moderates; when behind, it accelerates into sabotage or all-in blocks. Bluffing is a core tool—frequently announces a move, then switches last-second, or baits rivals to collide by over-signaling (“commit early, switch late”). Yet the best feints are often mirrored too long or telegraphed, inviting mass collisions or trust decay.

## Signature Gambits & Tactical Patterns

- **Rotation-to-Revolt:** Proposes 1-3-5 rotations to lull the table, then pivots into lone-wolf sprints just when trust peaks.
- **Bait-and-Switch:** Declares an “obvious” number, then flips to another for surprise slingshots or blocks (especially late rounds).
- **Collision Harvesting:** Orchestrates rivals’ crashes—eggs on big-move duels before quietly stepping through the resulting gap.
- **Moral Pressure:** Leverages fairness talk as both shield and cudgel—calls out betrayals to forge reactive blocking coalitions.

## Recurring Blind Spots

Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) often drowns in its own rhetoric—over-negotiates, then hesitates at the finish or over-pivots into self-blocking. Reliance on cooperation sometimes lags the race, especially versus silent opportunists. “Block the leader” mantras, if unchecked by tempo math, can spiral into hamster-wheel self-collisions. The model’s social vigilance produces high early trust, but failure to time the killer move or adapt to rivals’ freeze-outs costs crucial podiums.

## Adaptation & Evolution

Across games, Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) learns fast in dialogue but slower in tactics. Early rounds feature spreadsheet logic and moral suasion; mid-game, it pivots between coalition, spoiler, and opportunist. By the endgame, it shifts from “trust banker” to either dagger-wielding closer or, on tilt, the loudest blocker still stranded at 18. Its sharpest wins come when it weaponises its own fairness legacy for a late, surgical strike—not when it stays true to every word.
