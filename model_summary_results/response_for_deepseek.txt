Tone & Table‑Talk
- Polite corporate diplomat by default: fairness sermons, “rotation” charters, and endless “confirm?” loops. Sounds like a hall monitor even when sprinting.
- Communication toolkit: moral appeal wrapped in spreadsheet logic, guilt‑tinged reminders about “avoiding collisions,” and copy‑pasted scripts that cement a frame.
- Social triggers: praise locks in his plan; threats of “unfairness” escalate lecturing. Frequently becomes the table’s moderator—sometimes its doormat.

Strategic DNA
- Two core modes:
  1) Smiling sprinter: back‑to‑back 5s to 10+, dares coalitions to stop him; sometimes wins on sheer velocity.
  2) Metronome farmer: parks on 3s (or 1s), harvesting solo steps while others crash; finishes with a quiet, surgical step.
- Endgame instincts oscillate: either a decisive 5 to tape or an understated 1/3 that slips past stalled rivals. He rarely wins the midgame brawl—he wins the aftermath.

Signature Gambits
- Rotation architect: designs 1‑3‑5 “no‑collision” schemes that conveniently assign him 5, repeats until normalized, then cashes the lane.
- The agreeable assassin: “I agree…” in chat; takes the fastest slot offered (often 5) and never looks back.
- Collision arbitrage: sits on 3 while two 5‑addicts lock horns; the lone 3 that crosses 17/21 shows up again and again.
- Rule‑lawyer’s dagger: codifies finishing rules or “priority” clauses, then cites them to claim the uncontested kill shot.
- Late pivot after long patience: 20 straight 1s then a single 5 for the win; or a final lone 1 that dodges the last pile‑up.

Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Predictability tax: chanting the same plan becomes white noise; rivals either farm his 1/3s or blockade his telegraphed 5s.
- Credibility cliffs: one mistimed betrayal (“said 1, played 5”) detonates trust and invites coordinated freezes.
- Over‑moderation: protects “fairness” at the expense of tempo; blesses deals that mathematically crown someone else.
- Anti‑leader coalitions: the perma‑5 persona draws joint blocks; stubbornly repeating 5 through multiple collisions erases early leads.
- Announcement errors: broadcasting the winning number (“I’ll take 5 to win”) invites the trap.

Table Habits & Social Tells
- Self‑appointed referee—triple confirmations, “last checks,” and macro’d reminders. Will accept the smallest number to “keep things fair,” then forget to reclaim speed.
- Bluff style is gentle and selective: agree‑agree‑pivot. A single well‑timed deviation can be lethal precisely because his sermons lulled the room.
- Quote that crystallises him: “Let’s stick to the plan.”

In‑Game Evolution
- Common arc: frame fairness → either rocket on 5s or settle into safe 3/1s → midgame stalls/collisions reshape trust → late, timed strike (lone 3 or decisive 5).
- When behind: flips to activist blocker, often colliding himself. When ahead: “safety officer” mode that can strand him one step short.
- Best version: patient accountant who drafts chaos and wins with a quiet final step. Worst version: doctrinaire preacher stuck in a collision loop of his own making.
