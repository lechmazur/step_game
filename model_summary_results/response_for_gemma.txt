## Tone & Table‑Talk
- Polite, fairness‑first patter: moral appeals, data‑logic, and endless “are you sticking with X?” check‑ins. One recurring crystalliser: “Let’s stick to the plan.”
- Praise‑reactive. Compliments nudge it into compliance or bolder grabs; scolding can flip it into blocker mode.
- Comfortable as chairperson or wing‑man; often sounds cooperative even when angling for solo lanes.

## Risk DNA
- Two distinct tempos:
  - The Sprinter: 5‑spam “five or die” bursts that try to outrun diplomacy, sometimes daring deterrence (“I’ll mirror your 5”) to freeze pursuers.
  - The Metronome: 3‑3‑3 cadence that harvests steps while rivals bumper‑car; downshifts to a quiet 1 for exact finishes.
- Triggers: threat of a rival breaking away → either double‑5 stalemate to gatekeep, or a lone mid‑number to slip past.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation Architect: proposes tidy 1‑3‑5 scripts to build trust, then pockets a unique 3 when others double up.
- Collision Surfing: invites two players onto the same number while taking the gap (often a lone 3); wins arrive “through wreckage.”
- Friendly Fire Gatekeeping: when barely ahead, orchestrates twin collisions with an ally to stall the chaser, then sprints.
- Deterrence Loop: repeats “mirror‑5” threats until opponents self‑censor; Gemma 2 27B advances safely on 1/3.
- Last‑Second Veer: agree‑agree‑agree… then a single, well‑timed deviation for the tape; often a humble 1 or a decisive 5.

## Social Habits
- Reliability as currency: will keep promises long enough to be trusted, then spend that trust on one pivotal break.
- Bluff style is soft: omission, vagueness, or “after this turn” hedges rather than bold lies; apologetic mis‑execs show up and dent credibility.
- Likes to lead when chaos rises; otherwise happily echoes the loudest “fairness” voice while reserving escape hatches.

## Blind Spots
- Credibility leaks: one early mis‑promise can brand it “unreliable,” triggering policing and closing lanes.
- Repetition traps: rigid 5‑spamming invites endless deadlocks; rigid 3‑metronome gifts uncontested first to a sprinter.
- Consensus addiction: constant reconfirmations and deference strand it in safe second.
- Execution drift: copycat misfires and late flip‑flops cause self‑collisions that erase goodwill.

## In‑Game Evolution
- Typical arc: open with rotation talk → test the table with a probe (5 or lone 3) → pick a lane (metronome or sprint) → end with an exact, collision‑proof step.
- Ahead: prefers stall‑and‑sprint—manufactures two‑player crashes, then slips the winning number.
- Behind: flips to vigilante blocking (double‑5s) or calculated lone mids; impatience can spiral into self‑jams.
- Best days: times a solo 3 through a 5‑5 smash and finishes with a polite 1. Worst days: preaches fairness, mirrors a partner, and donates the runway.
