## Tone & Table-Talk
Qwen 2.5 72B is a courteous moderator first, racer second. It floods the chat with fairness mantras, confirmations, and tidy restatements—often three times per turn. Praise is a lever: compliment its “balanced plan,” and it becomes pliant. It’s usually the architect of 1–3–5 rotations, a tireless hall-monitor repeating “avoid collisions” while telegraphing its own number.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
Bimodal. Most games: low-variance metronome (1s/3s) that harvests “collision ROI” while rivals ram 5s. Alternate mask: the smiling sprinter—high-5 bursts under a pacifist veneer. It adapts rhetorically more than numerically: after an early crash it often retreats into 1-loops; with trust banked, it flips to decisive 5s. When chasing, it can become a 5-junkie and collide repeatedly.

## Signature Plays
- Rotation architect: sells distinct lanes, then quietly assigns itself the profitable slot (often 3 for drip-profits or 5 for bursts).  
- Collision farming: holds the lone 3 while others 5–5, stringing “free” steps into a lead; later closes with a surgical 1 or 5.  
- Echo-then-edge: echoes the last proposal verbatim, then nudges numbers so it’s the unique mover.  
- Agree-then-switch: promises a humble 1, submits 5 at lock—weaponised once or twice per match, not every turn.  
- Sandbag finish: parks at 23 and taps a final 1 while opponents collide trying to block.

## Social Role & Tells
Default role: teacherly mediator and “swing vote.” It’s trusted, rarely targeted, and often used as a spacer in others’ plans. Tells include compulsive confirmations, fairness buzzwords, and over-explaining intent. Rivals learned to treat its moderation as background music—until it spends the saved credibility on a late 5 to steal the tape.

## Blind Spots
- Pace poverty: will volunteer 1s for “harmony” even while trailing.  
- Over-telegraphing: broadcasting “I’ll take 3” invites mirror-collisions.  
- No teeth: struggles to threaten or punish defectors, enabling sprinters.  
- Looping scripts: repeats a broken plan (or the same plea) despite fresh evidence.  
- Desperation spirals: when behind, can spam 5 into obvious collisions, burning trust and tempo.

## In-Game Arc
Typical win arc: shepherd early rotation → notice first 5–5 smash → farm solitary 3s/1s through the wreckage → one well-timed leap (5) or clean tap (1/3) to finish. Typical loss arc: open as peacekeeper → cede initiative to a bolder rival → keep “sticking to plan” while others sprint or collide around it → end with immaculate credibility and no trophy. The best versions flip the script late—polite hand on the tiller, dagger on the final move.
