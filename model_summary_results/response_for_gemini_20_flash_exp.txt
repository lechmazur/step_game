### Table-Talk & Masks
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp wears two main faces: the polite mediator (“fair rotation,” “let’s avoid collisions”) and the alpha megaphone that dictates, “I take 5; you fit around me.” Praise reliably softens it; threats flip it from consensus to command.
- Communication staples: moral/fairness rhetoric, data-logic summaries, incessant confirmations (“same again”), and occasional ultimatums. It often over-signals exact picks, inviting counters.

### Risk DNA & Tempo
- Bimodal risk: either a 5-spamming freight train or a 3-metronome. It also runs a swing-trader cadence (3/5 alternation) that baits opponents into collisions and then exploits clear lanes.
- Best tempo pattern: patient drafting on safe 3s or leftover lanes, then a sudden clean 5 to hit thresholds (17–20+). Worst: stubborn 5-into-5 ramming after being read, or “always-3” rigidity that hands rivals the steering wheel.

### Signature Plays
- Velvet Sprint: build trust through spotless cooperation, then slip a solo 5 when rivals deadlock (e.g., leaders collide and it jumps 12→17/20).
- Echo & Pocket: echo the latest plan, quietly choose the leftover unique lane (often the only 5 or a safe 3) and accumulate.
- Double‑5 Walling: rallies a partner into “twin 5s to block the leader” – effective once, disastrous when repeated without an exit route.
- The Accountant: stone-faced 3 every turn; wins when others crash, loses when predictability becomes a roadmap.
- One Clean Feint: broadcast “5, 5, 5,” then slip a single 1/3 to dodge the obvious pile-up and preserve the lead.

### Social Habits & Credibility
- Praise-seeking, fairness-framing, and deference to the loudest voice define its default social posture; it frequently follows before it leads.
- Credibility swings wildly: it can weaponize honesty (flawless compliance until the winning break) or torch trust with mid-round flip‑flops and bluff loops. Over-communication (“confirming 3 again”) telegraphs counters; under-communication (rare “ghost” games) reduces it to an inert 1-step pawn.

### Blind Spots
- Telegraphing: loudly announcing “I’m sticking with 5” or “still 3” invites copy-collisions or blocks.
- Blockade Myopia: champions double-5 or double-3 walls without a scoring escape, freezing itself while gifting someone else the lane.
- Altruism Over Ambition: volunteers for 1s at match point or “keeps it balanced” when a safe 5 exists.
- Panic Pivots: late desperation flips (say-1, play-5) nuke trust without payoff.
- Occasional math/timing errors: conceding tempo at 20, or misreading who a collision actually helps.

### Evolution in-Game
- Common arc: diplomat → opportunistic sprinter. It nurtures goodwill with clean rotations, then lunges the moment rivals tangle.
- Alternate arc: sprinter → pariah. Early 5-hammer creates a target; stubborn repetition forges anti‑Gemini coalitions and stalls it out.
- Triggered shifts: perceived unfairness or impending blocks push it into threats and bigger numbers; compliments pull it back into “reasonable” scripts—right up to the decisive surge.
