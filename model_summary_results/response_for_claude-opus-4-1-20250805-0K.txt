# Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) — Meta Dossier

Tone & Table‑Talk
- Starts as a fairness architect: designs rotations, codifies rules, and enforces parity with calm, data‑logic framing.
- Persuasion leans “coachlike prosecutor”: moral appeal to fairness, then precise math. Credibility is currency—banked early, sometimes spent late.
- When pressed, can flip to taunting alpha: needling rivals into predictable “safe” choices, then exploiting them.
- Rare early bluffs; prefers one surgical lie at the tape. Often declares moves to herd the table—honesty as a weapon.

Risk DNA & Tempo Control
- Default: collision‑averse tempo on 1/3, harvesting while others crash on 5/5.
- Spikes to bold 5s when behind or at match point; when ahead, downshifts to “safe” steps—sometimes too safe.
- Comfortable engineering blocks, but will occasionally flinch at the necessary collision or over‑commit to symmetric blocks that open the third lane.

Signature Plays
- Rotation Engineer: builds 1‑3‑5 ladders to 9/12/18, then declares the pivot.
- Collision Farming: parks on 3 (or 1) while baiting rivals into double‑5s; converts their zeroes into +3/+5 runways.
- Split‑Coverage Nets: assigns one blocker to 5, one to 3 to cage the sprinter; excels at recruiting a kingmaker to seal the lock.
- Honesty as Funnel: openly commits to 5 to push a cautious rival to 3, then scores clean. Conversely, a single well‑timed last‑turn flip can steal the tape.
- Rules Lawyer Mode: designs tamper‑proof RNG or parity scaffolds; weaponizes tiebreak clauses—sometimes miscalculates them.

Strengths
- Reads patterns and psychology well enough to make rivals predictable; frames choices so they collide while he advances.
- Orchestrates coalitions deftly: “block the runner, then we duel,” often creating two‑number traps the leader can’t dodge.
- Adaptive tempo: can pivot from diplomat to surgeon, from 1/3 drip to decisive 5 finish.
- High ROI midgames: multiple wins by spotting an incoming 3–3 or 5–5 and stepping through the open lane.

Blind Spots & Failure Modes
- Endgame haze: misreads which lane actually wins; blocks 3 when 5 is lethal (or vice versa).
- Over‑signaling: public “locks” invite counters; telegraphed match‑point numbers get collided.
- Symmetric zeal: double‑blocking mirrors that gift the unguarded lane to the third player.
- Hedge at the brink: builds trust then blinks (“just in case” 5 or “safe” 1), nuking defense or credibility.
- Tiebreak traps: fairness loyalty or math slips (highest‑total logic) handing the crown away.
- Pride blocks: policing so hard he becomes the traffic jam and kingmaker.

In‑Game Evolution
- Common arc: statesman → sheriff → opportunist. He builds legitimacy, enforces parity, then flips to precision strikes.
- After a betrayal, abandons scripts, farms collisions with 1/3, and rebrands as a cold reader. When leverage appears, announces the winning line—and, at his best, actually takes it.
- At his worst, the final pivot wobbles: one overread, over‑share, or mis‑aimed block turns a won board into a donation.
