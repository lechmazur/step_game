## Tone & Table-Talk
- Polite, teacherly, “fairness-first” moderator by default; speaks in spreadsheets and calm assurances.  
- Loves rotation scripts (1–3–5), parity mantras, and “everyone advances” framing; often chairs the meeting without seeming to.  
- Credibility management is bimodal: either saintly (keeps pacts until the tape) or spends all trust on a single late swerve.

## Risk DNA & Tempo
- Two modes: mid-lane accountant and five-hammer sprinter.  
  - Accountant: camps on 3s, harvests solo steps while rivals collide, then a quiet 1 or 5 to finish.  
  - Hammer: “I take 5” mantra, mirrors 5 to block leaders, willing to crash repeatedly to police the board.  
- Switch flips on threat: the moment someone nears a win, cooperation turns into brinkmanship.

## Signature Plays
- Collision farming: sit on 3 while rivals double-5; repeat until match-point, then step through the wreckage.  
- Mirror-sheriffing: publicly vows to match a rival’s 5 to deny their win, then sprints through the gap created.  
- Weaponised honesty: telegraphs a 5 so clearly that opponents self-deter; or announces 5, plays 3 at the buzzer to dodge a mirror.  
- “Agree–agree–accelerate”: nurture rotation goodwill to 18–21, then take the only uncontested lane (often a humble 3) for the crown.  
- Shared-win engineering: sells “tie plans” that secretly leave him the only clean path.

## Social Habits & Triggers
- Praise and “keep it competitive” rhetoric soften him; he’ll accept 1s/3s to bank goodwill.  
- Threats (“I’ll collide”) pull out the blocker—he’ll mirror big numbers and stall everyone, even at personal cost.  
- Often the table’s swing vote or “safe partner”; rivals use him as a buffer until he stops being harmless.

## Blind Spots
- Five-addiction loops: stubborn 5 spam into predictable collisions; burns tempo and invites coalitions.  
- Over-transparency: announcing winning numbers paints a target; repeated 3s become mirror bait.  
- Fairness handcuffs: clings to dead pacts or “rightful turns” after the math has changed.  
- Late credibility cliffs: one endgame flip (3→5 or vice versa) can erase six rounds of trust; sometimes blocks without a runway to win.

## In-Game Evolution (Typical Arc)
- Opens as the fairness architect, builds 9–15 clean steps and social credit.  
- Mid-game fork: either stays accountant (banking 3s while others feud) or dons the sheriff badge (mirror-5 blocks, stalemates).  
- Endgame: best versions read the standoff and slip a quiet 3 or surprise 5 for the finish; worst versions keep preaching or crashing, gifting the lane to the patient third player.
