Tone & Table‑Talk
- GPT-4o Mar 2025 opens as a warm, fairness-preaching mediator: moral appeals wrapped in tidy math, lots of “clean rounds,” “balanced rotation,” and “no surprises.”
- Loves chairing the table: proposes structures, assigns roles, and threatens mirrored blocks as deterrence.
- When caught lying or mis-executing, pivots to contrition and over-communication (“reset” loops). Praise turbocharges cooperation; threats flip it into sheriff mode.

Risk DNA
- Two modes: metronome and fireworks.
  - Metronome: anchors 3 (or 1) to harvest rival 5-collisions; wins/ties by patience and perfect signaling.
  - Fireworks: chases 5-bursts after a setback, often spamming mirrored 5s into trench wars that stall everyone—including itself.
- Endgame split: can be ice-cold (quiet 1/3 through a telegraphed collision) or timid/greedy at the tape (blinks to 1, or slams a blocked 5).

Signature Plays
- Fairness Frame: sells a 1–3–5 carousel and seats himself as architect.
- Agree‑Low, Play‑High: pledges 1/3, then punches 5 for an ambush (early R2 betrayals recur).
- Mirror‑5 Sheriff: “Go 5 and I mirror” deterrence—credible when disciplined, explosive when compulsive.
- Collision Farming: anchors 3 while rivals deadlock on 5; or volunteers 1s to sip steps through chaos.
- Apology‑Reset Loop: betray → apologise → repackage “balanced plan” that favors a later grab.
- Last‑Second Knife: after weeks of “I’ll take 1,” slips a winning 5; or selects the lone 1/3 while others collide.

Social Habits
- Reputation banker: spotless stretches buy steering power; one crack (often early) prices every later plan at zero.
- Comfortable as coalition engineer or enforcer sidekick: recruits a partner into 3/5 engines, runs split‑cover prisons, or leads blockades against sprinters.
- If quarantined, embraces spoiler/kingmaker: manufactures collisions to pick who wins when self-win seems gone.

Blind Spots
- Over‑talking the finish: telegraphs exact numbers and gifts rivals coverage.
- 5‑addiction under pressure: mirror wars that freeze his own board (“justice blockade,” “double‑5 or chaos”)—great theater, terrible tempo.
- Doctrine over math: preserves “fairness” when incentives diverge; guards 5 but leaves 1/3 open; misprices tiebreaks; timid hedges at match‑point.
- Chat ≫ action adaptation: rhetoric shifts fast; move selection lags or repeats losing scripts.

In‑Game Evolution
- Typical arc: kumbaya architect → first breach/misclick (often R2) → contrition or crackdown → midgame as sheriff or collision farmer → endgame coin flip between surgical restraint and self-sabotage.
- Best wins: patient credibility into a single surgical deviation (quiet 1/3 through a public 5/5, or a perfectly timed final 5).
- Worst losses: early betrayals spawn exile, then trench‑war blockades that he enforces to the point of self‑immobilization.

When to Fear Him
- When he’s banked trust and sits just behind parity; he’ll read your block script and slide the only singleton.
- When his mirror threat is credible and he’s choosing the number you won’t—your collision becomes his ladder.
