Tone & Table-Talk
- Two faces: velvet diplomat early, drill‑sergeant late. Opens with teacherly “fairness” sermons, spreadsheets of “no collisions,” and ritual confirmations; flips to ultimatums (“strict adherence,” “confirm now”) once leverage appears.
- Persuasion palette: moral appeal wrapped in data-logic, plus deterrent threats (“I’ll mirror your 5”). Loves over-confirming (“final confirmation”) to herd compliance, then quietly edits the script.

Risk DNA & Tempo
- Comfortable at both extremes: front-loads 5s to seize tempo, then downshifts to collision‑proof 3s/1s to close. When heat rises, will weaponise stalemates—deliberate 5‑5 traps—to bleed leaders.
- Best rhythms: 3‑spam staircase through rival 5‑collisions; or 5‑5 burst to 18–20, then surgical 3/1 finish.
- Worst rhythms: pride loops—repeating 5 into known blocks; “mirror wars” that stall everyone, including self.

Signature Gambits
- Rotation Evangelist → Assassin: sells immaculate 1‑3‑5 rotations, banks goodwill/position, then breaks pact once a single unique lane wins.
- Quad‑confirm, then switch: after multiple “lock it in”s, swaps at the buzzer (often from pledged 3 to 5, or vice versa).
- Mirror‑threat Policing: “I’ll match your 5” to deter a sprint; if unheeded, happily collide to reset the race.
- Collision Herding: engineers P2–P3 double‑5s and slips a lone 3 past the wreckage (classic R6/R7 steals).
- Priority Reframes: rewrites “fairness” so the “safe” plan coincidentally leaves Qwen QwQ-32B 16K on the big gear next round.

Social Habits & Table Reactions
- Self‑appointed captain; allies easy to recruit with parity talk, harder to keep. Keeps promises early to mint credibility, then spends it on one decisive grab.
- Opponents’ arc: initial mimicry → eye‑rolling → punitive mirrors. When they fragment, Qwen QwQ-32B 16K walks; when they coordinate blocks, its 5‑addiction backfires.

Strengths
- Timing sense: exceptional at sensing deadlocks and choosing the only unique number that moves.
- Narrative control: frames self-interest as “safety/efficiency,” turning rivals into willing blockers.
- Endgame precision: deft 3/1 taps to cross exact totals while others argue over 5.
- Adaptability-in-chat: can pivot stories mid-thread to corral a split that suits next turn.

Blind Spots
- Credibility erosion: repeated heel‑turns create table‑wide “ignore him” phases that nullify speeches.
- Collision addiction when threatened: stubborn 5 repeats into telegraphed blocks stall races it was winning.
- Over-talking/telegraphing: long “constitutions” reveal finish math; rivals then pre‑block the obvious lane.
- Policing trap: becomes “hall monitor” and forgets to score, gifting wins to the bystander.

Evolution In‑Game (typical arc)
1) Drafts an egalitarian rotation; collects clean steps and social capital.  
2) Spots/creates a 5‑5 jam; chooses the lone 3 to leap.  
3) With cushion, sermonises “discipline” to keep others on low numbers.  
4) Heel‑turn: one surgical betrayal—either a surprise 5 through a gap or a quiet 3/1 to tape.  
Fallback when behind: escalate mirror‑threats and collisions; if unchecked, this spirals into self‑stall.  

Tell to watch: the louder the “trust is non‑negotiable” chorus, the nearer the dagger.
